https://gizmodo.com/playboy-magazine-new-platform-onlyfans-subscription-1850226149,Playboy Magazine Returns to Internet With New OnlyFansStyle Platform,The company is relaunching its iconic magazine online to promote its new creator platform called unsurprisingly Playboy,Leer en espaol Is there still room in todays world for Playboy The popular magazines current owner PLBY Group is reviving the original magazine in a digitalonly format with a catch This new P 4732 chars,Leer en espaol Is there still room in todays world for Playboy The popular magazines current owner PLBY Group is reviving the original magazine in a digitalonly format with a catch This new Playboy is a virtual display window for an OnlyFansstyle platform called of course Playboy The company announced on Monday that it was bringing back its iconic magazine with a mix of free and paid content According to Variety the new Playboy will offer select content for free but will require users to pay individual creators for behindthescenes content and full photo shoots Playboys first issue will be released at the end of this year but you can already view some of its first photos on Playboys website which feature the model Amanda Cerny Advertisement The Playboy platforms business model is very similar to one used by OnlyFans although there are some differences chiefly that Playboy allows nude photos but not hardcore porn Many of our creators do not have nudity on their pages a Playboy spokesperson told Variety While we allow nudity we do not allow explicit contentpornography We are not positioning this as an adult platformits for everyone including mainstream creators sharing behind the scenes of their lives GO Media may get a commission 28 Off Hoover PowerDash Pet Compact Carpet Cleaner Spring cleaning for pet owners This Hoover carpet cleaner has HeatForce technology that dries fast Buy for 86 at Amazon Advertisement Advertisement Unlike OnlyFans Playboy wont directly allow amateur models on its platform In order post on the site models have to send in an application and be accepted by the company The h istory of Playboy Magazine To understand exactly why Playboy the company decided to use its iconic magazine to promote its new creator platform its important to understand the magazines recent history Back in 2011 Playboy founder Hugh Hefner sold Playboy Enterprises to a company called Rizvi Traverse Since then the magazine has been fighting a threepronged battle To separate itself from its shady origins and history of discrimination against women to find a market on the internet where easy to find naked pictures completely free of charge and to find a balance between allowing full nudity in the pages of its magazine and not ruining its product licensing business in markets that dont allow that type of content Advertisement In 2015 for instance Playboy removed nudes from its magazine covers The CEO of the company at that time Scott Flanders justified this decision in statements to The New York Times Youre now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free And so its just pass at this juncture Flanders told the outlet At that time Quartz saw Playboys decision differently pointing out that the company was trying to be cleaner and more politically correct in its print edition to help its business in China and India Considering that Playboy generated 40 of its revenues from China at that time it made sense Advertisement Hefner died in 2017 and Playboy Enterprises decided to shutter the print version of the magazine in 2020 There were rumors about retiring the print magazine starting in 2018 partly due to the general crisis facing print magazines Playboy began publishing in 1953 and reached maximum circulation in 1975 when it printed 56 million copies of an issue in the US By 2018 its circulation had dwindled to less than 500000 copies per issue In March of 2020 the CEO of Playboy Enterprises Ben Kohn announced that the magazines spring issue would be its last in print The official reason Kohn cited for this decision was the distribution problems caused by the Covid19 pandemic but its clear the print version of the magazine had been heading for the chopping block for some time Advertisement One year later Kohn announced that Rizvi Traverse would merge with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp to form PLBY Group a company with three main business areas content licensing to third parties the sale of directtoconsumer products and digital content At that time Playboy already sold subscriptions for nude content on its website In May of 2022 in hired exTwitch executive Loren Piretra to launch Centerfold by Playboy a subscription platform similar to OnlyFans with its own app Advertisement Back in September PLBY Group scrapped the Centerfold name and integrated its creator platform with the original brand deciding to call it simply Playboy Is there still room in todays world for Playboy The question has nothing to do with nude photosat this point of the internet we should already be used to thosebut rather with its business model Advertisement Playboy defines its platform as an elevated safe and exclusive version of OnlyFans In practice what Playboy proposes is a mix of Instagram TikTok and OnlyFans but with content produced by professionals and sold via a subscription with no ads The problem is that Instagram TikTok and Twitter are already full of very talented artists whose content you can access without paying anything or by paying the artists directly via monetization platforms like Patreon KoFi or Twitters own monetization features,science

https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/tech/tiktok-ban-explainer/index.html,The US government is once again threatening to ban TikTok What you should know,Nearly twoandahalf years after the Trump administration threatened to ban TikTok in the United States if it didnt divest from its Chinese owners the Biden administration is now doing the same,Nearly twoandahalf years after the Trump administration threatened to ban TikTok in the United States if it didnt divest from its Chinese owners the Biden administration is now doing the same  6205 chars,CNN  Nearly twoandahalf years after the Trump administration threatened to ban TikTok in the United States if it didnt divest from its Chinese owners the Biden administration is now doing the same TikTok acknowledged to CNN this week that federal officials are demanding the apps Chinese owners sell their stake in the social media platform or risk facing a US ban of the app The new directive comes from the multiagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS following years of negotiations between TikTok and the government body CFIUS is the same group that previously forced a sale of LGBTQ dating app Grindr from Chinese ownership back in 2019 The ultimatum from the US government represents an apparent escalation in pressure from Washington as more lawmakers once again raise national security concerns about the app Suddenly TikToks future in the United States appears more uncertain  but this time it comes after years in which the app has only broadened its reach over American culture Heres what you should know What are the concerns around TikTok Some in Washington have expressed concerns that the app could be infiltrated by the Chinese government to essentially spy on American users or gain access to US user data Others have raised alarms over the possibility that the Chinese government could use the app to spread propaganda to a US audience At the heart of both is an underlying concern that any company doing business in China ultimately falls under Chinese Communist Party laws Other concerns raised are not unique to TikTok but more broadly about the potential for social media platforms to lead younger users down harmful rabbit holes Wait didnt all of this happen before If this latest development is giving you dj vu thats because it echoes the saga TikTok already went through in the United States that kicked off in 2020 when the Trump administration first threatened it with a ban via executive order if it didnt sell itself to a USbased company Oracle and Walmart were suggested as buyers social media creators were in a frenzy and TikTok kicked off a lengthy legal battle against the US government Some critics at the time blasted thenpresident Donald Trumps crusade against the app as political theater rooted in xenophobia calling out Trumps unusual suggestion that the United States should get a cut of any deal if it forced the apps sale to an American firm A logo of ByteDance at its office in Beijing China July 7 2020 Thomas SuenReuters The Biden administration eventually rescinded the Trumpera executive order targeting TikTok but replaced it with a broader directive focused on investigating technology linked to foreign adversaries including China Meanwhile CFIUS continued negotiations to strike a possible deal that would allow the app to continue operating in the United States Then scrutiny began to kick up again in Washington Lawmakers renewed their scrutiny of TikTok for its ties to China through its parent company ByteDance after a report last year suggested US user data had been repeatedly accessed by Chinabased employees TikTok has disputed the report What has TikTok said In rare remarks earlier this month at a Harvard Business Review conference TikTok CEO Shou Chew doubled down on the companys prior commitments to address the lawmakers concerns The Chinese government has actually never asked us for US user data Chew said and weve said this on the record that even if we where asked for that we will not provide that Chew added that all US user data is stored by default in the Oracle Cloud infrastructure and access to that data is completely controlled by US personnel TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is interviewed at offices the company uses on Tuesday February 14 2023 in Washington DCPhoto by Matt McClainThe Washington Post via Getty Images Matt McClainThe Washington PostGetty Images As for the concerns that the Chinese government might use the app to spew propaganda to a US audience Chew emphasized that this would be bad for business noting that some 60 of TikToks owners are global investors Misinformation and propaganda has no place on our platform and our users do not expect that he said In response to the CFIUS divestiture request a TikTok spokesperson told CNN this week that a change in ownership wouldnt impact how US user data is accessed If protecting national security is the objective divestment doesnt solve the problem TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan said in a statement A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent USbased protection of US user data and systems with robust thirdparty monitoring vetting and verification which we are already implementing Is TikTok really a threat to national security TikTok is really only a national security risk insofar as the Chinese government may have leverage over TikTok or its parent company China has national security laws that require companies under its jurisdiction to cooperate with a broad range of security activities The main issue is that the public has few ways of verifying whether or how that leverage has been exercised TikTok doesnt operate in China but ByteDance does Privacy and security researchers who have looked under the hood at TikToks app say that as far as they can tell TikTok isnt much different from other social networks in terms of the data it collects or how it communicates with company servers Thats still a lot of personally revealing information but it doesnt imply that TikToks app itself is inherently malicious or a kind of spyware Thats why the concern really focuses on TikTok and ByteDances relationship to the Chinese government and why the Biden administration is pushing for TikToks Chinese owners to sell their shares Where else has it been banned India banned TikTok in the summer of 2020 following a violent border clash between the country and China in a move that abruptly disconnected the more than 200 million users the app had amassed there While stopping short of banning the app on personal devices a number of other countries including the United States Canada and United Kingdom have recently enacted bans of TikTok on official government devices Late last year President Joe Biden signed legislation prohibiting TikTok on federal government devices and more than half of US states have enacted a similar mandate at the state level A TikTok spokesperson previously blasted this ban as little more than political theater The ban of TikTok on federal devices passed in December without any deliberation and unfortunately that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments the spokesperson added,business

debt mutual funds as shortterm capital gains according to amendments to the Finance Bill passed on Friday a move that could strip investors of the longterm tax benefits that made such investments popular COMMENTARY NAGESH CHAUHAN HEAD OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKET AT TIPSONS GROUP MUMBAI Indexation benefit from debt mutual funds has been removed and this could reduce inflows in debt mutual funds and benefit bank deposits and direct bond investments from high networth individuals HNI and family offices We might see short term bonds which are in the rating range of A to AA to attract fresh inflows Since these papers were not getting allocation from MF as per their risk averse investment policy and HNI investors were restricting allocation since taxation was not at par with Debt MFs Risk adjusted returns in the category of A to AA were not much rewarding to attract HNI investors earlier with this move taxation parity they would be keen to explore high yielding space SRIKANTH SUBRAMANIAN CEO KOTAK CHERRY MUMBAI The amendment in the finance bill will have significant structural changes to the way we invest For mutual fund to get investor interest itll now have to purely be on their ability to add extra risk adjusted returns and not because of any tax arbitrage The tax arbitrage that was available at an instrument level seems to be getting evened out across the board be debt MF or MLD marketlinked debentures However this will benefit the corporate bond market where there will be renewed interest from retail investors and this will also add depth to the liquidity which again will mean better pricing for the end customer NARENDRA DIXIT HEAD  RETAIL BANKING CSB BANK MUMBAI As of now debt mutual funds are treated as longterm investments if held for more than three years and taxed at the rate of 20 along with indexation benefits or 10 without indexation For those with a holding period of less than three years they are taxed according to their tax slab So for investors having more than threeyear horizon debt schemes were better visavis FD fixed deposit in higher tax brackets While FD always has the element of return being known upfront as rate of interest is fixed debt funds had the taxation edge due to the above rule Now with proposed change in tax rules FD and Debt MF are at par with each other in taxation FD carries an additional advantage of being free of interest rate risk Customers have the comfort of knowing the final return upfront at the time of booking The tax arbitrage of debt fund is now gone Also debt fund returns carry the interest rate risk We feel that a lot of long term investors will gradually shift to Bank FDs now  especially in high tax brackets MANISH P HINGAR FOUNDER FINTOO MUMBAI This move may have a negative impact on all debt funds particularly in the retail category as ultrahigh networth and high networth individuals may choose to invest in safe havens like bank fixed deposits We may see a shift from longterm debt funds to equity funds and money may be directed towards sovereign gold bonds bank fixed deposits and nonconvertible debentures in the debt category This is good news for banks as they can attract customers with higher interest rates and increase their borrowing and saving book sizes It is apparent that the government intends to remove tax arbitrage by creating a consistent tax policy across all debt instruments VISHAL GOENKA COFOUNDER INDIABONDSCOM MUMBAI Taxation rules across bond investments should be uniform as this simplifies the choice for investors who should focus on analysing the investment itself rather than the taxation disparity We welcome the proposed changes via the amendments to the Finance Bill as this creates a uniform level playing field between debt mutual fund and direct bond investment We always encourage investors to have fixed income in their portfolio for adequate diversification and the proposed changes will make direct bond investments by individuals more attractive AJAY BODKE INDEPENDENT MARKET ANALYST MUMBAI A long overdue step by the government to end favouritism by granting tax exemptions or deductions towards one sector MFs insurers at the cost of others Bank FDs PFs Post Office Savings etc which was leading to artificial propping up of demand for the former at the cost of the latter With governments stated intent to nudge tax payers towards progressive New IT regime such harmonization and elimination of deductionsexemptions should be lauded AMIT KUMAR GUPTA FOUNDER AND CIO FINTREKK CAPITAL DELHI Basically they have proposed to remove tax arbitrage Debt mutual funds were getting favourable tax treatment for indexation and longterm capital gains That has been removed now with this bill As an asset class debt mutual funds will get less attractive FDs may become more popular Banks are facing an issue of deposits also That can increase after the announcement Governments view has always been that uniform capital gains tax should be there across all asset classes But the decision does not affect the existing investor all the existing investments will be grandfathered CLSA ANALYSTS This is negative for MFs  Debt ex liquid contributes 19 of AUMs and 1114 of revenues For life insurers there seems to be no change to the taxation proposed in the budget and status quo remains with life savings taxed at marginal tax rate but tax arbitrage in favour of competing products such as MFs is gone now which at these valuations is a small positive for life insurers NBFCs get a material part of their funding from MFs  funding proportion from banks will go up Marginally positive for bank creditdeposits Reporting by Siddhi Nayak Bharath Rajeswaran Chris Thomas Bhakti Tambe and Swati Bhat editing by Eileen

CocaCola in major Indian market Reliance invoking nostalgia nationalism to promote Campa brand Analysts say Reliances retail reach could boost Campa prospects CHENNAINEW DELHI March 24 Reuters  Indian industrial giant Reliance is reviving a historic local cola brand with plans to use its vast retail network slash prices and tap nationalist sentiment to challenge US beverage giants PepsiCo PEPO and CocaCola KON in a key market Controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani Reliance RELINS this month launched revamped Campa drinks sugary sodas popular in India in the 1970s and 1980s before disappearing from shelves as the US giants expanded rapidly in a liberalising economy At first glance it may seem that Ambani will find it tough to loosen Pepsis and CocaColas stranglehold of a market Euromonitor estimates is worth 46 billion and set to grow 5 a year until 2027 Other well known tycoons have tried to go toetotoe with the drinks giants and failed most notably Richard Branson with his Virgin Cola But Asias richest person has famously disrupted Indias telecoms market seven years ago with cutthroat pricing to make Reliance the leading player in that industry And hes applying some of that same strategy in his soft drinks venture CocaCola and Pepsi are unused to a nationwide challenge and Reliance has the financial muscle and reach to challenge them with a local brand with high nostalgic value said Amulya Pandit a consultant at Euromonitor International A person with direct knowledge of Reliances plan said it aims to open some factories of its own or as joint ventures to make Campa and take the soda to hotels restaurants and inflight sales Production of Campa is currently outsourced after its 27 million acquisition of the brand last year The company is heavily discounting instore prices A twolitre Campa Cola bottle is priced at 49 rupees 60 US cents in stores a near 50 discount on its label price and around a third lower than 225litre Coke and Pepsi variants a Reuters check showed The smallest bottles of Campa Cola and Coke both cost 10 rupees while Pepsi starts from 12 rupees The price will be disruptive across said the person who added Reliance is planning an advertising spree during the upcoming popular IPL cricket tournament and is in talks with at least three teams to make Campa their refreshment partner The person did not want to be identified as the strategy is confidential Reliance did not respond to a request for comment while Pepsi said it doesnt comment on competition as a policy CocaCola said it has broadly kept prices of its small bottles unchanged since last year and was focused on expanding distribution Having new players in the market presents a great opportunity for investments to develop the market further it said Reliance Indias top retailer will supply Campa to its 2500 grocery outlets and thousands of smaller nonnetwork stores as part of its new consumer goods push from which it has set an internal target of 65 billion in annual revenues within five years The company also has a grocery shopping app and a wholesale vertical under which it supplies consumer goods to 500000 momandpop stores which it will also tap for Campa sales GREAT INDIAN TASTE VS FOREIGN BRANDS Reliances cola and consumer goods foray is being driven by T Krishnakumar an executive who worked for nearly 17 years at CocaCola in various leadership roles Pepsi and CocaCola will also cautiously eye Reliances marketing strategy after it targetted nationalist sentiment and nostalgia by promoting Campa as a homegrown brand with Great Indian Taste and a rich heritage A former Pepsi executive who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the subject said the US firm has always been worried about local products marketed with an India First agenda especially at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself backs selfreliance The rivalry is already playing out in the market In five Reliance outlets that Reuters visited in Mumbai in Indias west Chennai in the south and Lucknow in the north Campa cola or lemon plastic bottles were displayed at the main entry gates or placed on shelves just next to the rivals At one Chennai outlet a Reliance store manager said this year they were placing Campa at the entrance for promoting it with rivals tucked behind it and not visible at first glance Another city store employee said 30 Campa bottles were being sold for every 100 of Pepsi and CocaCola For now the US rivals have an upper hand Pepsi and CocaCola drinks are available in at least 3 million Indian outlets and the companies have a widespread logistics network dozens of factories and the advantage of a taste preferred by many said Alok Shah a consumer analyst at Indias Ambit Capital Well need to wait and watch to see if consumers switch to Campa he said adding that Pepsi and Coke remain aspirational foreign brands for many Indians offered at largely similar smallpack prices Srinivas Rao said he still loves CocaColas Thums Up a domestic brand it acquired in 1993 and is its bestselling one in India unlike in the US where Coke dominates We buy Thums Up every time we eat biryani or meat at home We are

premium phones in focus More Indians now want expensive phones with better features Affordable smartphones under 120 losing popularitydata Samsung loan scheme driving purchase of premium phonesexecutive NEW DELHILUCKNOW March 16 Reuters  Xiaomi Corp is overhauling its India strategy after misjudging consumer tastes in mobile phones a costly lapse that has allowed Samsung Electronics to pip the Chinese company to the top spot in the worlds second biggest market for the devices While Xiaomi remained focused on selling mobile phones under 10000 rupees 120 Indian consumers were willing to pay up for better looking models with richer features South Koreas Samsung launched products to meet those aspirations and offered innovative financing schemes that made them affordable to most Those moves have helped Samsung 005930KS wrest leadership of Indias competitive mobile phones market from Xiaomi 1810HK with data from Hong Kongbased Counterpoint Research showing it had a 20 market share for the last quarter of 2022 compared to the Chinese companys 18 The Indian market is witnessing a premiumisation trend But Xiaomi has been caught underprepared for the shift with a budget phonesheavy portfolio said Tarun Pathak a research director at Counterpoint The loosening of Xiaomis vicelike grip on the 626 million Indian smartphone users  the second biggest after China  shows how companies that fail to cater to changing consumer preferences in a fastgrowing economy with rising disposable incomes are being punished Most famously in India Tata Motors TAMONS 100000 rupees 1200 Nano billed as the worlds cheapest car was shunned by consumers who associated the low price tag with inferior quality Indians push for more expensive mobile phones to consume videos and other content will also benefit social media app providers such as Meta METAO and iPhone maker Apple Inc AAPLO which so far has a tiny market share in the country due to its sole focus on highend phones priced from 605 to as high as 2304 according to its website According to Counterpoint the market share of the sub120 phones in India fell to 26 in 2022 from 41 two years ago And premium phones  priced above 30000 360  saw their share double to 11 in the same period Xiaomi and Samsung both count India as a key growth market with smartphones their top selling electronic device The Chinese company recorded total revenue of 48 billion in 202122 in India while Samsung registered 103 billion in sales of which 67 billion came from smartphones Xiaomi though is already facing heat in India due to the departures of at least five senior executives and increased government scrutiny amid frosty relations with neighbouring China The company has 674 million of its funds frozen by the countrys financial crime agency for alleged illegal remittances to foreign entities which Xiaomi denies A Reuters check on product listings on Xiaomis website showed the mismatch between consumer needs and the products the company has been offering Xiaomi showed six smartphones priced above 360 compared with Samsungs 16 Under 120 Samsung had seven models while Xiaomi listed 39  most of which were shown to be outofstock And premium phones accounted for only 01 of Xiaomis total India phone shipments in the last two years when Samsungs higherend phones more than doubled their share to 13 Counterpoint data showed But Xiaomi which has acknowledged it introduced too many models in the past is revamping its product lineup to focus on premium smartphones It launched in January the Redmi Note 12 whose topend variant is priced above 30000 rupees and more recently the Xiaomi 13 Pro at 79999 rupees 970  its highest priced phone in India The strategic shift seems to have paid immediate dividends with the Redmi Note 12 clocking sales of 61 million within two weeks of its launch We have laid out a streamlined and cleaner portfolio with a focused approach to building expertise in the premium segment and the launch of our latest flagship Xiaomi 13 Pro is a step in that direction said its India President Muralikrishnan B We understand that we have a long way to go in this journey and therefore are bringing in much stronger products How Samsung gained Indias market leader crown LOANS FOR PHONES A Samsung scheme run with its financing partners that says it offers convenient and assured loans played a significant part in its recent success in India helping generate 1 billion in device sales last year A poster of Samsungs offering that Reuters spotted on a dusty street used by fruit sellers in Uttar Pradesh state said that even those with no loan history low credit scores or without salary slips could get a phone Sanjeev Kumar Verma owner of a nearby multibrand phone shop has benefitted from the companys loan scheme Speaking to Reuters in his shop where hundreds of phones are stacked on shelves Verma said he used to sell five Samsung phones each month but has quadrupled that to 20 now 18 of which are via the loan scheme Verma and another smartphone vendor in Mumbai said that unlike rivals Samsung required no local address proof making it easier for migrant workers or those working outside their home state to acquire phones on loans Samsung did not comment on the remarks by the vendors The growth in premium segment phones was much higher in small towns than in big cities Samsungs India mobile unit head Raju Pullan told Reuters in February adding almost half the consumers who opted for its financing scheme were firsttime loan seekers Samsung says its financing app installed on smartphones can lock the device and block outgoing calls for missing loan payments Xiaomi has also tapped partnerships to offer loans calling them a key growth driver for sales of phones priced above 15000 rupees 183 and adding it will explore more such offerings Muralikrishnan said the company will also open more stores beyond its current network of 20000 retail partners and boost local procurement of mobile phone parts likely reducing costs Some industry analysts said the new strategy could help the Chinese company return to solid growth in India Xiaomi has historically enjoyed a strong brand equity has a robust online and offline channel presence and can spring a comeback with a potentially strong premium and valueformoney product mix said Prabhu Ram head of
