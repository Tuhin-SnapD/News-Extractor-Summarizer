Google will implement a new rule for apps providing personal loans starting on May 31st that could help protect users from abuse and harassment. The tech giant has updated its policy via TechCrunch to prohibit cash lending applications from being able to access users contacts list. They will no longer be able to access peoples photos and videos as well whether theyre saved on the phone itself or an external storage. This is but one of the changes Google has implemented over the past year following multiple reports of harassment from certain markets such as India Pakistan Kenya and the Philippines. Its common for loan apps to require access to users phonebooks and media before they lend money. The fact that people can easily install these apps on their phones makes them look like a pretty convenient solution for sudden monetary issues. But since they typically charge exorbitant interest rates a lot of borrowers end up having difficulties keeping up with payments. Thats when the abuse begins. Agents for these services would mass send profanityladen texts to all the borrowers contacts including random acquaintances and coworkers in an attempt to humiliate them into paying. Some would even go as far as to threaten them and their family bodily harm. As TechCrunch previously reported the abuse got so bad for some people that it had driven them to suicide. In an attempt to keep these loan sharks under control Google implemented rules for India Indonesia the Philippines Nigeria Kenya and Pakistan requiring them to submit proof of approval and other documentation from the appropriate government agencies. In the US Google banned payday loan apps with an annual percentage rate of 36 percent or higher way back in 2019. And in Pakistan nonbanking financial institutions will only be allowed to publish one lending app on the Play Store starting on May 31st.

The tech giant tightened its screening measures for lending apps a year ago in the Philippines where I live.

Guns Blazing is a roleplaying game about revolutionaries and freedom fighters at the dusk of the colonial age. Players enter the myriad flashpoints of the age thrown against the machinations of colonial powers and supernatural monsters while navigating the contradictory seemingly irreconcilable politics of change. Basheer Ghouse the author of Guns Blazing answered a few questions about his newest TTRPG Kickstarter via email. Advertisement The interview has been lightly edited for brevity. Linda Codega io9 Can you describe the Ahadi system? Basheer Ghouse For Guns Blazing the core issues driving the Ahadi system were lethality dynamism and player engagement. I wanted guns to feel dangerous and lethal and I wanted to encourage aggressive movement in line with shooter video games. Advertisement The Ahadi system uses a dice pool where successes are spent to purchase success advantages and complications on a roll. The core mechanic aims to replicate the multifaceted outcomes of Genesis without proprietary dice. In narrative play it leans heavily on clocks and relationship mechanics to evoke the feel of pulp novels and period politics. In combat stamina and reaction systems work together to keep players engaged when it isnt their turn and reward tactical mastery as much as build mastery. Advertisement io9 Can you describe some of the inspiration behind the worldbuilding of Guns Blazing? BG The setting of Guns Blazing takes from the art of Keith Thompson Islamic folklore and legends early 20th century pulp fiction and an unfortunate game where I ended up Assistant GM and had to patch a bunch of orientalist lore on the fly. Its the dieselpunk I never got to see as a kid one that cares about places like India Africa and South America and where Islamic metaphysics are an assumed baseline rather than an awkward postfacto kludge from the author. Advertisement io9 How did you balance historical accuracy and creative freedom? BG This ones hard and Im not sure if I nailed it. My guiding light here has been the player experience not just in what makes a fun game but what makes it honest to the history. If I take out a fact to make the setting more accessible does that whitewash the crimes of a nation or group? Does it lie about the experiences of a minority in the period? Is it something players are actually interested in playing? I try to note the reality in the book even where its elided for playability or creative freedom. Advertisement My saving grace here has been the calibration tools section which very bluntly talks about some of the issues at play so I can delve into the fantastical and strange later. Advertisement io9 What is the most important thing for players to keep in mind while playing Guns Blazing? BG History is fragile. Every event presented as a historical inevitably could have gone very differently with very minor changes and that applies to how our actions will shape the future as much as it did how our ancestors actions shaped today.

CNN  More than 70 years after cheetahs were declared officially extinct in India the country is now home to four newborn cheetahs Indias Environment Minister announced Wednesday. The cubs were born to Siyaya and Freddie two of the eight rehabilitated cheetahs brought from Namibia to Indias Kuno National Park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh last September as part of a government plan to rehome 50 of the big cats in India over the next five years. Taking to Twitter Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav called the birth of the cheetahs a momentous event in our wildlife conservation history. Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi also welcomed the announcement calling it wonderful news. The announcement of the baby cheetahs arrival comes just days after one of the Namibian cheetahs a female named Sasha died of kidney disease. From bad news yesterday to renewed hope for ProjectCheetah this morning. Female cheetah Siyaya gave birth to four healthy cubs.

The group that arrived from Namibia in September consisted of three male and five female adult cheetahs including Sasha and Siyaya according to a news release from Namibias Cheetah Conservation Fund CCF. The animals were moved from quarantine enclosure to acclimatization zones in November last year and later released into the park. In February a dozen more cheetahs  seven males and five females  were brought in from South Africa which has signed an agreement with India to introduce dozens of cheetahs to the country over the next decade. Cheetahs are Indias only large carnivore to have gone extinct. Under British colonial rule forests across India were cleared to develop settlements and set up plantations resulting in the loss of habitat for big cats including the cheetah. Considered less dangerous than tigers and relatively easy to tame cheetahs were also frequently used by Indian nobility for sporthunting. Today the spotted felines are found in southern and eastern Africa particularly in Namibia Botswana Kenya and Tanzania according to the World Wildlife Fund WWF. But the endangered cats used to have a much larger range. Historically cheetahs roamed throughout the Middle East and central India as well as most of subSaharan Africa. Habitat loss poaching and conflict with humans have greatly reduced their populations. There are now fewer than 7000 cheetahs left in the wild according to the WWF.,Editors Note Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet together with the solutions.

The company teased the opening of its retail outlet in a brief statement Wednesday saying it was preparing to greet customers in the financial and commercial hub of Mumbai. Its previous plan to open a store in the country in 2021 was derailed by the coronavirus pandemic. The company released a photograph of its new boardedup storefront located at Jio World Drive Mall a property owned by Reliance Industries the conglomerate of Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani. Hello Mumbai the statement said. Apple is preparing to open its first physical store in India in the commercial and financial hub of Mumbai. Apple A notice outside the store said it would be arriving soon. Apple AAPL did not immediately respond to a request for further details such as the opening date. The launch would come more than 20 years since the Californiabased giant first entered the Indian market through thirdparty resellers. For years Apple and other foreign retailers were restricted from setting up shop in the country unless they sourced at least 30 of raw materials locally forcing them to rely on local partners. That changed in 2019 when the Indian government relaxed some investment rules. In 2020 the company launched an online store in India allowing customers to buy its products and also for the first time customize certain devices. CEO Tim Cook has previously pointed to the importance of starting its own retail network in the country saying I dont want somebody else to run the brand for us. Manufacturing base More recently the company has been ramping up manufacturing in India. It increased its exports from the country significantly last year with the number of iPhones made and shipped from India rising 65 in 2022 compared to the previous year according to Counterpoint Research. Apple first began making iPhones there in 2017. But in recent months it has expanded production after suffering severe supply chain snags in mainland China which accounts for the bulk of its smartphone manufacturing. Two of Apples top contract manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron were the fastestgrowing manufacturers in India during the last quarter of 2022 according to Counterpoint. Last month Foxconn CEO Young Liu spent a week in the country and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The southern state of Karnataka said Foxconn had announced a major deal during Lius visit and that 300 acres of land had been allocated for a facility. According to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources the Taiwanese company plans to invest about 700 million on a new plant in the state capital of Bengaluru to make iPhone parts. An Indian government minister said in January that Apple was hoping to boost its output in India to a quarter of its overall total from somewhere between 5 and 7. Apple did not respond to a request for comment at the time. Room for growth As a market for iPhones however India still has a long way to go. Apple leads sales of premium smartphones in India with the iPhone 13 ranking as the countrys overall bestseller in the segment last year according to Counterpoint. But the company lags behind other brands in the overall market which is led by Xiaomi and Samsung SSNLF the research firm said. Apple accounted for just 1 of Indias smartphone market in 2019 and may notch more than 5 this year Prachir Singh a Counterpoint senior analyst added. He said its market share could grow as it opens its own stores in the country particularly as Mumbai is the second largest Indian market for Apple after Delhi. Apple will be able to control the endtoend user experience and this will further take its brand image one level up Singh said.,Hong Kong CNN  Apple is finally getting ready to open its first physical store in the country as it bets on India as a market and manufacturing base.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/15/us/where-immigrants-come-from-cec/index.html,Where immigrants come from and where they go after reaching the US,Heres where immigrants to the US come from how migration patterns have shifted in the last 60 years and where immigrants settle once they get to the US,The US is home to more immigrants than any other country more than 45 million people according to the latest Census estimates Thats 136 of the US population about the same as it was a century a 5653 chars,CNN  The US is home to more immigrants than any other country  more than 45 million people according to the latest Census estimates. Thats 13.6 of the US population about the same as it was a century ago. But over the years weve seen significant shifts in where immigrants to the US come from and where they end up once they get here. Heres a look at these key immigration trends and how theyve changed over time. For decades one country has topped the list Mexicans represent the largest group of immigrants living in the United States. Thats been true since 1980 according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. And the MexicoUS route is the largest migration corridor in the world. But the total number of Mexican immigrants living in the US has been on the decline for more than a decade. An estimated 10.7 million Mexican immigrants lived in the US in 2021 roughly 1 million fewer than the number a decade earlier. Meanwhile immigration from other countries including India and China has been on the rise according to MPI. As one expert told CNN last year the range of reasons why people move to the US from different parts of the world is as varied as the list of countries these immigrants once called home. Some are seeking economic opportunities. Others are fleeing violence persecution or climate disasters. And others are hoping to reunite with family members who are already here. According to an analysis of Census data from MPI the top 10 countries of origin for immigrants in the United States are all in Latin America and Asia. These statistics include both immigrants who came to the United States legally and those who are living in the country without authorization. Looking only at the population of undocumented immigrants living in the United States the list of the top countries of origin shifts slightly. A Department of Homeland Security report in 2021 estimated that the top six countries of origin for undocumented immigrants were Mexico El Salvador Guatemala India Honduras and China. But most immigrants who live in the United States arent undocumented. The Pew Research Centers latest estimates indicate about 10.5 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States. That means the vast majority of foreignborn people living in the United States 77 are here legally. Rewinding to the 1960s reveals a different picture Mexico hasnt always topped the list. Back in 1960 for example the portrait of US immigrants was dramatically different. At that time according to the Migration Policy Institute the largest group of immigrants were Italians followed by Germans and Canadians. Why did things change so significantly? For decades a national original quota system passed by Congress in 1924 favored migrants from northern and western Europe and excluded Asians. In 1965 the Immigration and Nationality Act created a new system that prioritized highly skilled immigrants and those who already had family living in the country. That paved the way for millions of nonEuropean immigrants to come to the United States. It fundamentally changed the demographics of the country Pawan Dhingra a professor of American Studies at Amherst College told CNN in 2020. For decades the immigrant population in the United States had been decreasing. But the new law also sparked a dramatic increase in immigration in the decades that followed fueled largely by family reunification. In 1965 9.6 million immigrants living in the US comprised just 5 of the population according to the Migration Policy Institute. Now more than 45 million immigrants make up nearly 14 of the country. While the total number of immigrants has reached a historic high immigrants made up a greater share of the US population in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most states have seen their immigrant populations grow The makeup of whos coming to the United States isnt the only thing thats changed. There have also been notable shifts in where those immigrants end up. Arriving immigrants often settled in historic immigrant gateways in major metropolitan areas such as New York City Chicago and Boston. But for more than a decade a much broader swath of locations in the United States have become gateways that are home to growing immigrant populations. Today California Texas Florida New York and New Jersey are home to the largest numbers of immigrants. But looking at the total number of immigrants in each state only tells part of the story. Some states have larger numbers of immigrants relative to their total populations. In Hawaii for example immigrants make up nearly 19 of the states population. A recent study by the Bush Institute found that many immigrants eventually move from traditional gateway cities to other areas of the country. Immigrants making secondary moves within the United States are disproportionately choosing the same places as nativeborn people  metros with relatively affordable housing and growthfriendly business and tax policies the study says. Once there they gravitate toward fastgrowing suburban counties. For many years the majority of immigrants lived in the Northeast and Midwest. But now according to the Pew Research Centers latest analysis about twothirds of immigrants live in the West and South. And in recent years some states have seen their immigrant populations grow at a faster rate. As the Bush Institute study notes job opportunities affordable housing family connections and immigrantfriendly policies are among the factors that immigrants consider when deciding where to move. If current trends continue experts say in the coming years we could see immigrants make up a historically high share of the US population. But with geopolitical turmoil around the world and ongoing divisive debates over immigration in Washington its hard to predict where future groups of immigrants may come from or how quickly that milestone will be reached.,CNN  The US is home to more immigrants than any other country  more than 45 million people according to the latest Census estimates.

Time Out the publisher of global city guides polled 20000 people in 50 cities to find out how they feel about their local mass transit systems. The top ten  out of 19 total cities listed  is entirely comprised of destinations in Asia and Europe with Berlin landing in the number one spot. The highest entry from North America is New York City at number 15 and no other continents are represented  better luck next year Buenos Aires Doha and Melbourne. While only residents were surveyed this list is also useful for travelers as they decide where to go next and how best to get around. What makes for great transit? Public transit is a broad term that includes subways aboveground trains buses trams and even ferries. To make it onto Time Outs list at least 80 of polled residents had to agree that its easy to get around their city via mass transportation. According to Time Outs data a whopping 97 of Berliners had positive things to say about their citys mass transit infrastructure praising the network for being reliable comfortable and safe. But there are other factors to consider when traveling by train or bus  namely aesthetics. Stockholm in seventh place was one of the cities praised for its beautiful subway stations. Many of its Tunnelbana stations feature colorful and dramatic designs earning it the nickname the worlds longest art exhibit. Its not only the stations themselves that are known for good looks. Hong Kongs famous aboveground trains known locally as ding dings for the sound they make even have their own Pantone color HK Tram Green. These days the trams appear in a range of colors and designs but the iconic color dates from the postWorld War II era when the British military had a surplus of green paint. In addition to its highlyrated mass transit Singapores Changi airport regularly wins praise. FotoGraphicAdobe Stock Asian standouts Seven of the top 19 cities hailed for their mass transit systems are in Asia. Most are in east Asia with Singapore Shanghai and Taipei all picking up accolades but Mumbai squeaked in at 19th place. The Indian megacity recently introduced Chalo Pay a new app that makes it easier to book and pay for transit tickets without needing to carry cash. But it was Tokyo in third place that had the highest showing for the continent. The citys mass transit was applauded for being wellmaintained efficient and easy to navigate even for nonJapanese speakers. 92 percent of Taipei residents polled by Time Out said their citys transit was easy to use. SimonAdobe Stock European stars Six of the top 19 cities were in Europe with an additional two  London and Edinburgh  in the UK. Several of these cities won praise for having one unified payment system to cover a variety of forms of transit. In Copenhagen a regular commute can include water taxis that whisk travelers across the harbor while 10place Amsterdam makes it seamless to transfer between buses trains and trams. Perhaps its not a coincidence that both of these cities also appear on CNNs list of the worlds best cities for exploring by bicycle. Sustainability initiatives in the European Union mean that many metropolitan areas offer incentives to reduce car traffic. Whether you travel by tram train or bicycle its a way to visit major tourist attractions while reducing your carbon footprint. The worlds best cities for public transit 1. Berlin Germany 2.

https://www.cnn.com/style/article/marina-tabassum-architect-bangladesh-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,Meet the awardwinning architect building flatpack homes for flood victims,In Bangladesh Khudi Bari homes can be packed up and relocated but are still able to withstand heavy wind and rain They were created by architect Marina Tabassum who hopes to better the lives of those in floodprone regions,Among the stretching plains of Bangladeshs river deltas the Khudi Bari looks small The twostory structure resembles a freestanding treehouse with a pitched roof covering a platform that balan 7191 chars,Written by Rebecca Cairns CNN Contributors Kev Broad Jane Sit Mun Ng Salman Saeed Among the stretching plains of Bangladeshs river deltas the Khudi Bari looks small. The twostory structure resembles a freestanding treehouse with a pitched roof covering a platform that balances on spindly legs. Its name means tiny house in Bengali and its thin bamboo frame looks frail against the rolling yellow fields and the swirling tides splashing against the river bank. While the humble dwelling looks fragile its the landscape that is delicate. Along these river deltas the map changes every few years with riverbank erosion causing islands known as chars to rise and fall with the seasons. A lot of people lose their land. A lot of towns have vanished into the water said Marina Tabassum. The awardwinning founder of Marina Tabassum Architects MTA wanted to find a solution for these landless people who are frequently forced to move to escape flooding. They need to move the moment the sand bed starts to vanish said Tabassum. The idea was that they should be able to move with their structure. Lightweight and modular the Khudi Bari is designed to be folded down packed up and relocated while still able to withstand heavy wind and rain  a steady presence in a transitory lifestyle. This awardwinning architect is building flatpack floodproof homes Tiny house big impact Bangladesh is one of the worlds most vulnerable countries to climate change and experiences severe monsoons and flooding for several months every year. The coastal areas of Bangladesh where we are facing the sea level rise and the changing biodiversity and ecology those areas need a lot of attention said Tabassum. She and her team began researching the needs of these communities back in 2018 but it wasnt until the pandemic hit  and many other projects ground to a halt  that they had time to fully explore the idea of what this temporary structure might look like. A city and its health is defined by how good your public spaces are. That really contributes to the mental and physical health of the inhabitants. Marina Tabassum Architect Working through a variety of ideas the team chose bamboo as the principal material. Locally available cheap durable and lightweight it is easy to move and carry. Fastened with steel joints and metal corner braces for strength the structure can be easily assembled and disassembled with minimal labor. Unlike many other temporary structures the Khudi Bari has two levels. The ground floor is built on compact earth and walls can be made with any locally found material such as corrugated iron or woven bamboo or it can be left open for agricultural storage. The second floor which can sleep up to four people is six feet from the ground and accessed by a stepladder offering a safe space to shelter during flooding. Homegrown architecture Tabassums compassion for the landless perhaps comes from her own family history and upbringing. The grandchild of immigrants Tabassums family hails from Malda in West Bengal India. They left their hometown during the HinduMuslim riots that began after partition in 1947  and the war and famine of Bangladeshs early years after gaining independence in 1971 was the backdrop of Tabassums childhood. Tabassum says the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque pictured has a special place in her heart as it was commissioned by her late grandmother. Credit Sandro Di Carlo Darsa These early experiences have informed her architectural practice. Architecture grows from the land so if you want to root it in its place then you have to have a deep understanding of where its located she said. Throughout her nearly threedecade career she has designed some of the countrys most noted landmarks including the Museum of Independence Monument and the Aga Khan Awardwinning Bait Ur Rouf Mosque. Tabassum said that during her university studies the curriculum was filled with works designed by foreign architects  so she was determined to create a language of architecture which is of Bengal of Bangladesh. Influenced by the work of late American architect Louis Kahn and his student Bangladeshi architect Muzharul Islam Tabassums style is one of simplicity playing with light and dark and the contrast of lines and shapes to create dynamic spaces that blend interiors with the natural world beyond. In addition to the Aga Khan Award in 2016 Tabassums work has been further recognized winning the Soane Medal in 2021 and most recently celebrated in a solo exhibition at the TUM Museum of Architecture in Munich Her work focuses on local historical materials like red brick and bamboo  which has the additional benefit of reducing costs and carbon emissions associated with transport and the supply chain. Shying away from commercial projects Tabassum takes inspiration from her father who was the only doctor in the neighborhood where she grew up and pursues architecture that supports the community and responds to crisis and need. Tabassum uses light as ornamentation in the Bait Ur Rouf Mosque a constellation of holes in the ceiling create an invisible chandelier casting a kaleidoscope of light across the floor. Credit Sandro Di Carlo Darsa I really love designing public projects especially places where people gather she said. A city and its health is defined by how good your public spaces are. That really contributes to the mental and physical health of the inhabitants  in that respect I think we still have some way to go. Ephemeral structures To facilitate the distribution and building of the Khudi Bari Tabassum founded a nonprofit branch of her firm called FACE Foundation for Architecture Community Equity that could help provide proper shelter and living conditions for marginalized groups such as climate refugees nomadic communities and lowincome populations. In 2021 the Khudi Bari project received a grant from the Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh to fund its first 100 tiny houses which cost roughly 450 each to build. Through community workshops and engagement events in rural communities Tabassum said the team selects families who are more deserving of a new home. Architecture of people where people live its always been something which is a constantly evolving process. Marina Tabassum Architect The beneficiaries range from widows trying to provide for their children to those struggling to make ends meet because of lifelong disability. So far FACE has built 40 of these tiny homes in the southern coastal chars of Chandpur as well as the northern floodprone communities of Kurigram and Sunamganj. The idea is not to build the entire village said Tabassum. We are building these houses to see how the buildings react to the climate but at the same time how people appropriate it. FACE is not just building these tiny homes for the sandshifting communities on the chars. On Bangladeshs border with Myanmar around one million Rohingya refugees live in Coxs Bazaar. Refugee camps are not allowed to build permanent structures or lay foundations so Tabassums team has adapted the modular Khudi Bari to create homes and community space there. Everybody has a right to good architecture she added. Tabassum has adapted the Khudi Bari structure to create larger community spaces at the Rohingya refugee camp at Coxs Bazaar. Credit City Syntax Because of the climate crisis because of the sea level rise and all the different unpredictable phenomena that are happening around us its important to not create something too permanent Tabassum said. I dont believe that every building needs to last a hundred years. Architecture of people where people live its always been something which is a constantly evolving process she added. It never sought permanence. And so its sort of ephemeral in its quality and its character.,Written by Rebecca Cairns CNN Contributors Kev Broad Jane Sit Mun Ng Salman Saeed Among the stretching plains of Bangladeshs river deltas the Khudi Bari looks small.

REUTERSFrancis Mascarenhas Summary Summary Companies RBI holds repo rate at 6.50 Analysts had expected one more hike of 25 bps RBI sees war against inflation continuing Bond yields fall sharply rupee down slightly MUMBAI April 6 Reuters  The Reserve Bank of India RBI surprised markets by holding its key repo rate steady on Thursday after six consecutive hikes saying it was closely monitoring the impact of recent global financial turbulence on the economy. The central bank said its policy stance remains focused on withdrawal of accommodation signalling it could consider further rate hikes if necessary but a number of economists now expect the central bank to remain on hold. It is a pause not a pivot RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at a media conference after the monetary policy announcement. The monetary policy committee MPC comprising three members from the central bank and three external members retained the key lending rate or the repo rate INREPOECI at 6.50. Most analysts had expected one final 25 basis point hike in the RBIs current tightening cycle which has seen it raise the repo rate by a total 250 bps since May last year. We expect the RBI to maintain an extended pause and evaluate the lagged impact of previous rate hikes and global uncertainties on growthinflation dynamics said Upasna Bhardwaj chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. Some other central banks including in Canada Australia and Indonesia have similarly paused while the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of England and the European Central Bank have indicated they may pause to assess the impact of past hikes and banking sector turmoil on growth and inflation. Reuters Graphics We have to be extremely prudent in our actions Das said in his statement. While the central bank has taken the decision to pause rate hikes in light of global macroeconomic and financial conditions our job is not yet finished and the war against inflation has to continue Das said reiterating the resolve to bring inflation back within the central banks target band of 26. Retail inflation rose 6.44 yearonyear in February easing from 6.52 in January but has remained above the central banks mandated target range for 10 out of the last 12 readings. The central bank sees inflation at 5.2 in 202324 and GDP growth is seen at 6.5 in the financial year beginning April 1. With unyielding core inflation we remain firm and resolute in our pursuit of price stability which is the best guarantee for sustainable growth said the committee in its statement. The impact of our actions over the past 12 months is still playing out and would increasingly weigh on the future inflation trajectory. It is necessary to assess the cumulative impact of actions taken so far said Das. Early signs of a slowdown have been visible in bank credit growth which has slowed to 15.7 onyear as of March 10 easing from a decade high of 17.9 touched in October. Reuters Graphics Financial stability concerns appear to have prompted the pause in rate hikes said Aditi Nayar chief economist at rating agency ICRA adding that another hike was possible if inflation does not fall. The decision to hold interest rates steady was unanimous in contrast to the last decision when four members had voted for a hike in rates. Five of the six committee voted in favour of continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation while one member dissented. Retaining the stance at removalofaccommodation also signals a continued focus on steadily guiding inflation down towards the 4 target said Saugata Bhattacharya chief economist at Axis Bank. The hiking cycle could resume if the data warrants it said Shilan Shah deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. But given the subdued growth outlook and the likelihood that inflation falls back to within the RBIs target range before long our view is that the tightening cycle is at an end. Barclays does not expect any further rate hikes in the cycle. We think only a material upside surprise keeping CPI inflation above 6 for a long period would warrant another rate action by the MPC said Rahul Bajoria chief India economist at Barclays. voting pattern of MPC members on interest rates Government bond yields fell sharply after the surprise RBI decision. The 10year benchmark 7.26 2032 bond yield dropped to 7.1469 the lowest level since Sept. 15 immediately after the policy announcement against 7.2857 before the decision. The yield was at 7.21 as of 1.20 p.m. IST 0750 GMT. The Indian rupee declined marginally against the U.S. dollar. The rupee was at 81.98 to the dollar against 81.88 prior to the policy announcement.

The move part of a renewed push by Prime Minister Narendra Modis administration to slim down the public sector would help the government monetise unused land to minimise losses at staterun companies and help them raise funds. Land is a state subject in India with both the Parliament and state assemblies able to write laws around certain land rights. As a result land disputes often end up tangled in a web of bureaucracy. The panels objectives will include negotiating with state governments on disputes for freehold land and deciding on compensation among others one of the government officials said. The officials did not want to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Some state governments also use the land owned by federal governmentrun companies. This panel can explore seeking alternate land from the state governments for such companies the first official said. The panel will be chaired by a top central government bureaucrat he added. In March 2022 the government set up the National Land Monetization Corp NLMC to monetise surplus land and building assets of stateowned companies and other government agencies. Once disputes are resolved the NLMC would step in to facilitate sales the first official said. Staterun firms had identified around 14 million square metres of land for monetisation in March 2022 according to data shared by the government in response to a question in the Parliament. However NLMC is yet to sell any land assets. Indias Finance Ministry which oversees the NLMC did not respond to Reuters email seeking comment. In November the Indian government asked publicsector firms to consider moving the countrys insolvency court to shut lossmaking units while demerging the units land assets to ensure that land disputes did not hamper the process.

The data is due at 1200 GMT on April 12 less than a week after the RBI surprised markets and analysts by holding its key interest rate steady at 6.50 when most expected a 25 basis point rise. Food inflation which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket is expected to have moderated due to falling vegetable prices offset in part by surging cereal prices. Inflation as measured by the annual change in the consumer price index CPI INCPIYECI was forecast to have fallen to 5.80 in March from 6.44 in February according to the median view from the April 36 Reuters poll of 39 economists. If realised this would be the only month this year so far inflation is reported below the 6.00 RBI upper tolerance limit. Forecasts ranged from 5.40 to 6.40 with a quarter of survey respondents predicting inflation above 6.00. It was 6.52 in January and spent most of last year above 6.00. Sujit Kumar economist at Union Bank of India said vegetables and fuel likely pulled inflation down as well as the fact the base from a year ago was particularly strong. But with oil prices having surged more than 20 from their recent lows fuel is likely to push inflation back up again. We think the RBIs stance is somewhat risky with inflation having proven far stickier than the Bank should be comfortable with noted Mitul Kotecha head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. Inflation was expected to average 5.2 in the current fiscal year well above the mediumterm target of 4.0 according to a separate Reuters poll.

Similar protests and vandalism were seen outside Indian missions in some places in the United States and Canada. Khalistan refers to an independent Sikh state sought by separatists but which does not exist. Police in Punjab where Sikhs are in the majority launched a hunt for separatist leader Amritpal Singh last month after he revived talk of an independent homeland. His comments raised concerns of a return to the separatist violence of the 1980s and early 1990s that killed tens of thousands of people. Sikh separatists claim the action against Singh is unjustified.

A large majority of economists 49 of 62 said the Reserve Bank of India RBI would lift its repo rate INREPOECI by 25 basis points to a sevenyear high of 6.75 at the conclusion of its threeday meeting on April 6. The central bank has already raised rates by 250 basis points since May last year. The need for another rate hike is driven by elevated level of core inflation which has remained near or above 6 since middle of 2021 said Gaura Sen Gupta an economist with IDFC FIRST Bank. Retail inflation rose 6.44 yearonyear in February easing from 6.52 in January but has remained above the central banks mandated target range of 26 for 10 out of the last 12 readings. Core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy components was also expected to have stayed high between 6.056.12 in February according to estimates from three economists. Unseasonal rains could keep food prices high and a surprise decision by OPEC and its allies to cut output recently has also pushed up oil prices which could add to imported inflation. The policy space to focus on inflation is lent by domestic growth conditions holdingup supported by urban consumption and services sector recovery Sen Gupta said. Indias manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in three months in March while services industry growth eased slightly from Februarys 12year high private business surveys conducted by SP Global showed. A few economists however said that signs of turmoil in the U.S. and European banking sector could lead to tighter financial conditions and a steeper global slowdown. Early signs of a slowdown in India are also visible in easing imports and plateuing bank credit demand. Risk management considerations mean that MPC will opt for a pause in April said A Prasanna head of research at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. The committee will retain its option to hike later by maintaining its phrase withdrawal of accommodation he said essentially holding on to its tightening bias. The Reuters Poll showed that a majority of respondents 20 of 36 expect the central bank would maintain its withdrawal of accommodation stance while the remaining 16 said it would shift to neutral. Banking system liquidity has improved in recent days after having been in deficit towards the end of March. Liquidity surplus stood at 2.11 trillion rupees on Wednesday its highest since Sept. 5 and more than double the 1.04 trillion rupees surplus in the previous session. However after the initial few days in April liquidity is expected to tighten again as the government kickstarts its borrowing programme and credit offtake from banks increases. While the central bank might step in to thaw conditions via ad hoc variable repo rate operations preference will be to keep the net liquidity balance close to noninflationary neutral or slight deficit with relief expected by way of government spending or likely return in portfolio inflows said Radhika Rao senior economist at DBS Group Research.

Moreover there will less arbitrage between NDF and the onshore market helping in managing the rupee he added. In times of heightened volatility the USDINR NDF rates tend to be higher than the onshore rates leading to arbitrage opportunities and a spillover of offshore volatility. When rupee fell to a record low in October 2022 the USDINR 3month rate on NDF was about 40 paisa higher than onshore. This fuelled more demand for dollars onshore adding pressure on the rupee. This measure will further deepen the FX market in India and provide enhanced flexibility to residents in meeting their hedging requirements RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said in his policy speech.

The price will apply to industrial buyers and companies in the fertiliser and city gas distribution sectors and will be fixed on a monthly basis. India last year set up the panel led by energy expert Kirit Parikh to review Indias gas pricing formula to ensure fair prices to consumers after stateset prices of gas from old fields and a ceiling price for output from hardtoaccess difficult blocks rose to record highs. Last week India held back on raising the prices of gas produced from the old blocks in a sixmonth revision for AprilSeptember as the cabinet could not meet to discuss the gas panel report. The monthly price of gas produced from old blocks will be fixed at 10 of the monthly average of the Indian crude basket with a cap of 6.5mmBtu and a floor price of 4mmBtu Information Minister Anurag Thakur told reporters. After two years both the cap and ceiling price would annually rise by 25 cents Oil Secretary Pankaj Jain said. Oman and Dubai crudes make up on average 75.6 of Indias crude basket with 24.5 coming from dated Brent. In the previous formula India linked the prices of gas with global benchmarks including Henry Hub Alberta gas NBP and Russian gas. Old fields mostly operated by Oil and Natural Gas Corp ONGC.NS and Oil India Ltd OILI.NS account for about 80 of Indias annual gas output of about 91 billion cubic metres. Lower gas prices would hit the earnings of the two companies. However additional gas production made from new wells through fresh investment in old blocks would be sold at a premium of 20 Oil Secretary Jain said. He also said notification on the pricing will be issued tomorrow and be effective from Saturday. The move to overhaul gas pricing is also part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis aim to raise the share of gas in Indias energy mix to 15 by 2030 from 6.2 to help India meet a 2070 net zero carbonemission goal.

Ukraine made its request during a fourday visit to India by First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Emine Dzhaparova that ended on Wednesday the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Dzhaparova held talks with Indias junior foreign minister Meenakshi Lekhi and handed over a letter from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Prime Minister Narendra Modi the ministry said. It gave no details of the letter. Rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies the ministry cited Dzhaparova as saying. India has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war including medicines and medical equipment. Dzhaparovas visit was the first by a highranking official from Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. India has not been as critical of its old ally Russia as some other countries for its invasion and it has increased its purchases of Russian oil. India has sought a diplomatic solution to the conflict while Modi in comments seen as mildly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin told him in September that now was not an era of war. Dzhaparova in comments to media during her visit said Ukraine wanted India to be more involved in helping resolve the conflict and Ukraine looked forward to welcoming Modi to Kyiv one day. India holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 and Dzhaparova said Ukraine expected India to invite Ukrainian officials to G20 events and that Zelenskiy would be keen to address a G20 Summit in New Delhi in September as he did by video during the groupings last summit in Indonesia. The Indian ministry did not refer to these requests in its statement. India does not want the war to overshadow G20 events Indian officials have said but the first two G20 ministerial events India hosted in February and March saw rifts over the war between G7 nations one the one hand and Russia and China on the other.

Gandhi the 52yearold scion of the NehruGandhi political dynasty and leader of the Congress party was found guilty of defamation by a court in the western state of Gujarat over comments he made in a speech in 2019. Gandhi has filed a plea in the Surat sessions court against the magistrate order the Indian Express newspaper reported while a senior Congress party official who declined to be named told Reuters the court is scheduled to hear the plea on Monday. Gandhis lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Indias parliament disqualified Gandhi after sentencing as the law that governs elections in India mandates disqualification of any lawmaker who is convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years. A lower court sentenced Gandhi on March 23 for two years in jail on charges of defamation. Opposition politicians say Gandhis trial and the disqualification is the latest evidence of the Modi governments strongarm tactics and follows investigations and legal troubles faced in recent months by other opposition parties. Gandhi said on March 25 that he would not comment on his sentence as the matter was subjudice but he said his disqualification from parliament was because he had asking Modi what he called tough questions over Modis relationship with Gautam Adani founder of the Adani conglomerate. The opposition critics accuse Modi government of giving undue favours to a business group led by billionaire tycoon Adani. Shares of Adani group companies plunged after Hindenburg Research on Jan. 24 alleged that the Indian company had engaged in stock manipulation and used tax havens. It also said the group had unsustainable debt. A day after Gandhis conviction 14 political parties jointly petitioned the Supreme Court saying opposition groups were being selectively targeted by federal investigative agencies. The court has agreed to hear the plea on April 5.

The exchange came days after India objected to China renaming or standardizing names of 11 locations in the eastern state of Arunchal Pradesh which China calls southern Tibet and claims as its territory. Indian newspapers reported this week that two Indian journalists posted in Beijing were barred from returning to their jobs in the Chinese capital from India. Correspondents for The Hindu newspaper and state broadcaster Prasar Bharati were told on Tuesday that their visas have been frozen an Indian source familiar with the issue told Reuters. Asked about the visa suspensions Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Thursday that Chinese journalists have received unfair and discriminatory treatment in India for a long time and a Xinhua journalist was recently asked to leave India by March 31. China has always treated Indian journalists well Mao said. Chinese authorities have been in touch with the Indian government which did not respond nor correct the mistake she said. China therefore has to take corresponding counter measures to safeguard our legitimate interests. China welcomes Indian journalists to work in China. If India can correct its mistakes China is willing to continue to facilitate Indian journalists in China Mao added. In New Delhi foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said India hoped Chinese authorities would facilitate their continued presence and reporting from China. Relations between the nucleararmed Asian giants have deteriorated since mid2020 when Chinese and Indian troops clashed on their disputed Himalayan frontier leaving 24 dead. The situation has largely calmed after military and diplomatic talks but the faceoff continues in pockets along the frontier. Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar last month said the situation on the border was fragile and dangerous with military forces deployed very close to each other in some places.

In an interview with Reuters Singh said India which holds the rotating presidency of the G20 has proposed harmonisation of the best possible standards to regulate trade in green hydrogen which should be produced using only renewable energy rather than low carbon fuel. Why should countries which have been preaching the virtues of energy transition and decarbonisation back something called low carbon. Its either clean or not clean he said. Hydrogen made by electrolysis plants that split water can be used as a fuel. If the energy used to power the plants is renewable it is called green hydrogen. Singh said the Indian G20 presidency had put forward a draft definition that he considered reasonable and held discussions with various countries. If the world wants to decarbonise the world must agree on a definition of green hydrogen. Without harmonisation of standards you wont have trade he said. The draft definition assumes there would be some unavoidable green house gas emissions from the overall production process including from the necessary equipment. It proposes setting a limit of 1 kilogram CO2 equivalent for every kilogram of green hydrogen produced and the energy source for producing the hydrogen must be entirely renewable a government official said speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press. Across the world countries are turning to green hydrogen as a solution to climaterelated energy problems. India in January said it had approved an incentive plan of 174.9 billion rupees 2.11 billion to promote green hydrogen to cut emissions and try to become a major exporter in the field.

However its listing plans were stalled by the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI in September because of compliance problems related to share issuances. SEBI restarted a review later that month. The IPO faced another setback in January this year after SEBI raised certain compliance issues related to employee stock plans in a private letter. Digit told Reuters in January it was evaluating amendments to its employee stock appreciation rights scheme after receiving SEBIs letter. Such rights provided by the company enabled an employee to receive a bonus equivalent to the rise in the companys stock price over a certain period which Indian regulations prohibit for companies going public. Due to this Digit was found not to be eligible for making an initial public offer according to SEBIs letter.

Indian business news publication Moneycontrol reported earlier in the day that the SoftBankbacked startup laid off about 380 employees reducing its total employee count to under 3000. Edtech startups in India have laid off thousands of employees in the past year and have been unable to raise funding as a slowdown gripped the market. Companies that have cut staff include Tiger Globalbacked Vedantu and Byjus  Indias biggest startup valued at 22 billion. However venture capital firm GSV Ventures told Reuters last month that India is still one of the worlds most exciting markets for education technology investors. Fears of an economic downturn prompted startups to slash thousands of jobs in recent months.

Data overnight showed U.S. headline inflation softened in March. The markets are now pricing in one last Fed rate hike of 25 basis points in May followed by rate cuts from July. However U.S. core inflation remained elevated in March which analysts warned could be a cause for concern. It seems that investors are very much welcoming the forthcoming Fed easing cycle. They have a conviction call that the dollar will weaken and are looking for opportunities ING analysts wrote in a note. The minutes of the Feds meeting in March revealed worries about the banking crisis with staff projecting a mild recession later this year. That seemed to weigh on Asian equities that mostly closed lower also dragged by a tech selloff in Hong Kong. Meanwhile data showed Indias merchandise trade deficit widened morethanexpected to 19.73 billion in March after two months of improvement.

Out of the targeted 50 GW in new green energy tenders every year 10 GW will be for installation on wind turbines according to the memo. Solar currently makes up over half of Indias renewable energy capacity while wind energy accounts for nearly a third. Though coal remains the dominant source of electricity output Indias rate of addition of renewable energy capacity is second only to China among major nations in the AsiaPacific region.

REUTERSAmit Dave April 5 Reuters  Coal India Ltd COAL.NS will increase supplies to industries the worlds largest coal miner said on Wednesday as fuel inventories at utilities run by coal increased by over twofifths over the last one year. The staterun miner has historically prioritised supplies to power plants sometimes at the expense of the nonregulated sector  which includes industries such as aluminium smelters and steel mills. This year Coal India is hopeful of increasing supplies to the power sector by 4 to 610 million tonnes as it targets production of 780 million tonnes. With 610 million tonnes programmed to meet the power sectors demand availability of coal for the nonregulated sector increases sizeably the company said in a statement. The miner could raise supplies to the industries by as much as 170 million tonnes during fiscal year 2024 compared with 108 million tonnes in 202223  which was the lowest in at least four years. Even after compensating for any unforeseen demand surge from thermal power plants coal accessibility to the nonregulated sector would be much better in 202324 the company added. A rise in sales to industries typically offers higher margins than its mainstay longterm contracts with utilities and could help the company add to its higher profits over the last few quarters. Higher profits have helped the miners shares climb 17.3 in the last one year despite a 1.5 fall in the broader Nifty index during the same period. The company improved its supplies to utilities during fiscal year 202223 due to record production helping India recover from a crippling coal shortage that had caused widespread power cuts in April. Coal accounts for 73 of Indias power generation and utilities account for more than 75 of its use. India is the worlds secondlargest producer consumer and importer of the fossil fuel.

It remains uncertain however whether Sri Lankas biggest bilateral creditor  China  will join the initiative launched by Japan this years G7 chair with the aim of kicking off a series of meetings among Sri Lankas creditors. To be able to launch this negotiation process gathering such a broadbased group of creditors is a historical outcome Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told a briefing. This committee is open to all creditors he said voicing hope China will join in the effort. French Director General of the Treasury Emmanuel Moulin told the briefing that the group was ready to hold the first round of talks as soon as possible. Sri Lankas central bank governor had told Reuters earlier this week that having a single platform for talks would be a welcome move that would make it easier to discuss and share information. I hope the creation of this platform will become a model case for debt restructuring of middleincome countries Suzuki said. Japans top currency diplomat Masato Kanda told reporters the group has sent an invitation to all of Sri Lankas bilateral creditors including China and hopes to hold the first round of talks at the earliest date possible. The island nation of 22 million people last month secured a 2.9 billion programme from the International Monetary Fund to tackle its huge debt burden. But the middleincome economy could not apply for relief under the G20s common framework for debt treatments which targets only lowincome countries. That has put the onus on major economies to come up with an alternative scheme leading to the creation of the new platform. Sri Lanka owes 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors according to official data from its government with 3 billion owed to China followed by 2.4 billion to the Paris Club and 1.6 billion to India. The government also needs to renegotiate more than 12 billion of debt in eurobonds with overseas private creditors and 2.7 billion on other commercial loans. Sri Lanka kicked off talks to rework part of its domestic debt this month and aims to finalise the deal by May.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI has formed an internal view that due to the pending cases it wont approve NSEs application made last year for an IPO the sources said. Till the legal and regulatory issues are cleared there is no chance that SEBI will approve NSEs IPO plans said one of the sources who is a senior regulatory official. A delayed NSE IPO will test the patience of its core shareholders  banks insurance companies and foreign funds  who have been waiting for an exit opportunity in rising markets. A listing would allow NSE to have a broader shareholder base like its biggest competitor BSE Ltd BSEL.NS. SEBI and NSE did not reply to emailed requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as the matter is confidential and the regulator does not comment on specific entities. The regulators reluctance to approve NSEs IPO has not been previously reported. Sources have said NSE in 2016 had targetted offering 10 of its total shares in a listing and given the current grey market valuation of 2 trillion rupees 24.35 billion the IPO size could be around 2.5 billion. NSE is also the worlds largest derivatives exchange in terms of contracts traded and its core shareholders include Life Insurance Corporation of India LIFI.NS State Bank of India SBI.NS Canada Pension Plan Investment Board a Tiger Global fund and a Morgan Stanley fund among others. It has been embroiled in a long running case since 2016 related to equitable access to all its trading members. SEBI in an order in April 2019 had faulted the exchange for not ensuring equitable access and fined it 11 billion rupees but the exchange challenged the order in the Securities Appellate Tribunal a judicial authority. In January this year SAT set aside some parts of the SEBI order and reduced the fine on the exchange but the matter was escalated by SEBI to the Supreme Court which on March 21 agreed to hear the matter. Following the SAT order shareholders of NSE sought clarity from the exchange on the likely timing of the public offering in an investor call in February according to a transcript of the call uploaded on the exchange website. In response the exchanges CEO Ashish Chauhan said the matter is in the hands of the regulator. There are many legal matters pending across many courts in the country which may or may not have any bearing on the IPO at all Chauhan said. Apart from the ongoing case in the Supreme Court SEBI is still finalising orders in two other cases involving NSE said the regulatory source. These include whether certain brokers made unfair gains due to preferential access to NSEs trading systems and another lapse in NSEs trading architecture the source said. 1  82.1250 Indian rupees Reporting by Jayshree P.

Emine Dzhaparova told broadcaster CNBC TV18 in an interview that Kyiv also expected India to invite Ukrainian officials to participate in G20 events and intensify political dialogue with Kyiv. India holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 this year and hosts a leaders summit in September. New Delhi has not been as critical of Moscow as others for its invasion of Ukraine and has even ramped up its buying of Russian oil  the lifeblood of its economy  while others have sought to buy less or ban it. Dzhaparova who is on a fourday visit to New Delhi told the broadcaster We believe India should be engaged and involved in the Ukraine issue to a great extent. We believe intensification of political dialogue on the highest level is first step towards this big goal. My president is requesting a phone conversation with the Prime Minister. We are looking forward to welcome him in Kyiv one day she said. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day she said India should be pragmatic in securing its resources including energy and defence equipment while warning against dependence on Russia. India has sought a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine while Modi told Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that now is not an era of war. India has also boosted its purchases of Russian oil taking advantage of the deep discounts following a European ban on Russian oil imports. Russia like the Soviet Union before it has been Indias main source of arms and defence equipment for decades and it has now displaced Iraq as Indias top crude supplier as well. We only think it is crucial to diversify all of the resources not only energy but also military resources Dzhaparova said. When you are dependent from Russia they always use this blackmail instrument. Dzhaparova will meet Indias deputy national security adviser and a junior foreign minister during her visit and address a world affairs think tank.

On USDINR nowadays minor support and resistance levels are important considering how rangebound it is a trader at a private sector bank said. The 82.50 level is important from the psychological point of view. The last time it reached here it the pair faced good offers. The rupee mirroring its Asian peers struggled after a production cut of around 1.16 million barrels per day was announced by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC oil producers. Oil prices jumped with Brent crude futures at one point up more than 8. A rise in oil prices impacts the rupee directly in form of a higher import bill and indirectly in terms of inflation. Surprise cut is consistent with the new OPEC doctrine to act preemptively because they can without significant losses in market share Goldman Sachs said in a note. It raised its forecasts from Brent crude by 5 to 100 for December this year. The Reserve Bank of Indias policy decision due Thursday and the U.S. jobs report scheduled for the following day are seen key for the rupee. The RBI is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points while the U.S. data is projected to show 238000 job additions.

The states  including Maharashtra home to the countrys financial capital Mumbai Indias most populated state Uttar Pradesh and Prime Minister Modis home state of Gujarat  are estimating expenditure to have risen 21.5 in 202223 and plan to increase it further by 11 in 202324.

Indian states release their local budgets through the months of February and March after the federal budget is proposed. While the latest budgets are factoring in an aggressive spending growth in the coming year 202324 it must be borne in mind that states have generally failed to achieve their spending targets in recent years ISEC PD economists Tadit Kundi A Prasanna and Abhishek Upadhyay wrote. Reuters Graphics Indian states collectively tend to spend more than the federal government and have an important bearing on growth and welfare. Expenditure as a  of GDP has fallen in FY23 despite buoyant revenues wrote Pranjul Bhandari said India chief economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets. Bhandari attributes slower state spending to an end of a compensation cess volatility in oil prices and an increase in commitments linked to social schemes sponsored by the center. In addition steps have been taken to disincentivize offbudget borrowings by the states Bhandari said. We believe each of these drivers of lower state spend are likely to spill over into FY24. Reuters Graphics A lower rate of state borrowings however could provide some breathing space for the bond market making for a silver lining they said. Economists at HSBC expect state fiscal deficit to be 2.3 of the countrys gross domestic product GDP in FY23 and 2.5 of GDP in FY24 both lower than the normal permissible limit of 3 of GDP. ISEC PD expects states to borrow a gross amount of around 8.1 trillion Indian rupees and a net amount of 5.3 trillion rupees in the coming year. In FY23 states borrowed 7.6 trillion rupees below the budgeted 9.1 trillion.

But it stayed above the 50mark separating growth from contraction for a 20th consecutive month. Indias service sector built on to the momentum gained in February with further increases in new business intakes and output...However manufacturing has retaken the mantle as the main driver of growth said Pollyanna De Lima economics associate director at SP Global Market Intelligence. Manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in three months during March a separate survey released earlier this week showed but the slowdown in services growth pulled a composite index down to 58.4 from 59.0 in February. A subindex tracking new business inflows in the services industry declined to 58.1 from 59.5 in February and firms hired at the slowest pace in 10 months citing adequate capacity. Future business expectations slipped to their lowest in eight months. Weakness was seen with regards to jobs...as a general lack of pressure on operating capacities and diminished confidence towards growth prospects prevented hiring activity De Lima said. The softer outlook came despite input cost pressures easing to levels not seen in 212 years and better growth in foreign demand. But service providers were able to pass on some of their additional cost burdens to clients thanks to resilient domestic demand which in turn increased the pace of prices charged to their quickest in three months. That suggested persistent price pressure. Overall inflation eased slightly to 6.44 in February but remained above the Reserve Bank of Indias RBI 26 target range. Inflation is unlikely to return to the RBIs 4.0 mediumterm target any time soon putting further pressure on the central bank which is expected to hike its key repo rate by 25 basis points on Thursday.

REUTERSThomas WhiteIllustrationFile Photo MUMBAINEW DELHI April 3 Reuters  A surge in Indias services exports which hit a record high in the OctoberDecember quarter is expected to shield the economy from external risks as a slowing global economy will likely weigh on the countrys merchandise exports. Service exports are no longer being driven by IT services alone but also by more lucrative offerings such as consulting and research and development analysts and economists told Reuters. Indias services exports rose 24.5 on year in OctoberDecember 2022 hitting a record 83.4 billion during the quarter data released by the Reserve Bank of India RBI on Friday showed. The services surplus which deducts any imports in the category also rose 39.21 to a record 38.7 billion. This together with a drop in merchandise trade deficit resulted in the current account deficit shrinking more than expected to 18.2 billion or 2.2 of GDP. We expect services exports to grow to over 375 billion by March 2024 as compared to 320350 billion for the year ending March 2023 said Sunil Talati chairman of the Services Export Promotion Council. Services exports will likely surpass goods exports by March 2025 he said. OctoberDecember merchandise exports stood at 105.6 billion according to latest RBI data. Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics IT services still accounted for 45 of Indias total services exports in AprilDecember. Professional and management consulting grew the fastest  at a 29 compounded annual growth rate over the last three years as per estimates by economists at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets. The recent growth in services exports has been largely powered by global capability centres which have started to offer global clients a range of highend and critical solutions such as accounting and legal support. As a result such exports will hold up better compared to goods exports in the face of a weakening global economy analysts said. Over the last two to three years there has been a rapid growth in global capability centres said Sangeeta Gupta chief strategy officer at software industry lobby group Nasscom. Nasscom estimates that India is home to over 45 of such global capability centres in the world. According to Pranjul Bhandari chief India economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets such centres started off providing support functions but they have now moved up the ladder to tech enablement business operations capability development and even RD and business development. Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics While U.S. companies were the first movers in India a lot of companies from Europe Australia and Asia are also exploring stepping up their operations Nasscoms Gupta said. An acceleration in digitalisation after the Covid crisis and a lack of adequate tech talent in some of these countries are key factors she added. Sectors such as tourism education financial services and health also contributed to Indias higher service exports. EXTERNAL SHIELD The continued rise in services exports is likely to help rein in Indias current account deficit. We now revise our CAD estimates for 202223 and 202324 to 2 68 billion and 1.4 of GDP 53 billionrespectively from 2.6 and 2 earlier said Vivek Kumar an economist at QuantEco Research. Reuters Graphics However sustaining services exports would partly depend on how demand conditions in developed markets hold up said Gaura Sen Gupta India economist at IDFC FIRST Bank. India has a comparative advantage in services exports particularly in software services. There is room for further growth with Indias share in world commercial services exports currently just at around 4.

We have a number of hydro PSUs Public Sector Undertakings. We are thinking whether these hydro companies can come together as a hydro large PSU. Then it becomes a specialised hydro company Power and Renewable Energy Minister Singh said in an interview on Monday. NTPC the countrys largest power producer acquired the two hydro companies  THDC India Ltd THDCIL and NEEPCO  three years ago for about 1.34 billion under a consolidation plan by the Indian government. The power ministrys proposal to create a single company is aimed at better management and expertise besides reducing costs and managing related challenges. Hydropower plants in India take decades to come on stream as they face opposition from environment and religious groups. Hydro powers share of Indias energy has fallen to 11 from 49 15 years ago due in part to protests by different groups and land clearances. The combined entity after the merger of THDCIL and NEEPCO with NHPC would have 20 GW of hydro assets. NHPC which is also stateowned currently has 12 GW of hydro assets. The minister did not give details of other companies that could be merged into NHPC. NTPC is more of a company which is into thermal and is going rapidly into green energy.

The FDI decline resembled a wider global phenomenon amid investor uncertainty worsening profitability of multinational corporations and moderation in private equity and venture capital investments. However some concerns over the decline in potential growth in India widening income inequality and some macro stability issues in 2022 could have also weighed in on FDI the economists said. Citis preliminary analysis of sectoral FDI does not suggest any meaningful response so far to Indias productionlinked incentive scheme put in place to boost local manufacturing and exports. And despite the current account deficit CAD being expected to improve to 1.4 of the gross domestic product in fiscal 2024 the slowdown in FDI inflows means the basic balance  the sum of CAD and FDI  is likely to be in deficit for almost three consecutive years Citi said. This will increase Indias reliance on more volatile foreign portfolio inflows and rate differentialsensitive commercial loans to fund the CAD said Citi.

New Delhi has been upset about protests and vandalism by Sikh separatists  who seek an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan  outside the Indian High Commission in London and elsewhere in the U.S. and Canada. In a telephone conversation with Sunak Modi called for strong action against antiIndia elements by the British government following the incident Modis office said in a statement. Sunak condemned the incident as unacceptable violence his Downing Street office said in a readout of the call. He stressed that extremism had no place in the UK and updated on the steps being taken to ensure the security of Indian High Commission staff Sunaks office added. UKIndia bilateral ties became tense last month when protesters in London with Khalistan banners reportedly removed an Indian flag from the balcony of the High Commission during a protest in which the buildings windows were also broken. British foreign minister James Cleverly had condemned the violence last month but Thursdays call was the first official discussion between Modi and Sunak about the incident. Both sides also said Modi and Sunak agreed on needing to speed up negotiations for a free trade agreement between Britain and India which a British newspaper report said this week had stalled over the incident. The two leaders are also due to meet at the G7 summit in Japan next month and the G20 in India later this year. The demonstration outside the Indian High Commission was staged to denounce recent police action in the Sikhmajority Indian state of Punjab against a proKhalistan Sikh preacher. The demand for Khalistan which led to violence that killed tens of thousands of people in the 1980s and 1990s has revived in sections of the Sikh population in India and overseas. Indian officials conveyed concerns over proKhalistan groups to British counterparts during a meeting of interior ministry officials from both countries in New Delhi on Wednesday. In the meeting the Indian side requested better cooperation with Britain to tackle the misuse of UKs asylum status by the ProKhalistani elements to aid and abet terrorist activities in India and with UK the Indian government said.

The rules dictate that social media platforms make reasonable efforts to not publish share or host any information relating to the government that is identified as fake false or misleading by a government appointed factchecking unit. The Bombay High Court hearing a petition filed by comedian Kunal Kamra asked the government to file a reply on the plea and scheduled the next hearing for April 21. There may be many interpretations of a certain thing or statement but that doesnt make it false or fake Justice GS Patel said during the hearing news website Live Law reported. In his petition Kamra said that the amendments constitute unreasonable restrictions to freedom of speech and expression. He further stated that the move would lead to an unreasonable restriction on his fundamental right to practice trade or profession since he relies on social media platforms to share his content. The amendments could lead to his content being arbitrarily blocked or taken down or his accounts being suspended or deactivated Kamra stated. Prime Minister Narendra Modis government has been in repeated tussles with various social media platforms when they failed to take down certain content or accounts that it accused of spreading misinformation. The IT rules have led to concern in several quarters including among opposition party leaders and the press. The Editors Guild of India on Friday said the draconian rules gave sweeping powers to the government and were akin to censorship. Government officials however dismissed these concerns and assured factchecking would be done in a credible manner.

Higher demand from industry for seaborne coal will thwart efforts by India the worlds second largest producer and importer of the fuel to cut its dependence on shipments from mines in Indonesia Australia and South Africa. Indias demand for seaborne coal is set to peak during the summer season beginning this month just as neighbouring Chinas coal imports have jumped with the worlds No. 2 economy recovering from the COVID19 pandemic supporting global prices. That means Indias manufacturers face a double whammy having to pay more for imported coal and for haulage as the train shortage has forced them to receive coal by trucks which costs more per tonne than by rail. Industrial coal users accounted for about 70 of Indias thermal coal imports in 2022. Logistical challenges could boost overall Indian thermal coal imports by 3 in 2023 to 169 million tonnes said Abhishek Rakshit a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Growth in Indian coal imports will definitely support the prices of the low to midcalorific value coal market through most of 2023 Rakshit said. Reuters Graphics RAIL CONSTRAINT Coal India which produces 80 of domestic output plans to increase coal allocated to industries by as much as 57 from lsat year to 170 million tonnes for the year to March 2024. However Indian Railways which delivers most of the miners coal on trains will likely fail to keep up with manufacturers demand as it prioritises power plants and as addition of new trains has not kept pace with demand industry officials say. Train supply to Coal India for delivering fuel to industries declined every month in the last fiscal year a Reuters analysis of government data showed. The share of trains in Coal Indias fuel transport fell to the lowest in three years during the 2023 fiscal year too. Despite a steep increase in coal production movement of coal by railways has failed miserably said Rajiv Agarwal secretary general of the Indian Captive Power Producers Association. This summer India could face a daily shortage of at least 50 trains capable of carrying about 200000 tonnes of coal for both utilities and industries said a senior coal ministry official who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. Nevertheless stateowned Indian Railways told Reuters it was supplying trains for coal transport as per demands placed by coal companiesconsumers and average coal transport had grown more than 11 during the 2023 fiscal year. Reuters Graphics The industrial sector is currently allocated 2025 trains per day against demand of 50 trains per day and as a result smelters will be forced to import power or coal to sustain their operations a spokesman for the Aluminium Association of India AAI told Reuters. Aluminium smelter operators such as Vedanta VDAN.NS and Hindalco HALC.NS are among Coal Indias biggest industrial longterm customers. Similarly Indian paper mills are finding it extremely hard to source coal the Indian Paper Mills Association said. Some paper mills which had never imported coal before have been forced to do so in the last two years the association said. COSTLIER AND DIRTIER Due to the rail constraints the share of trucks in coal movement rose to nearly 30 in the first ten months of the last fiscal year on track to hit the highest level in four years. Road transport is about 35 more expensive than trains and emits nearly three times more carbon dioxide per kilometre according to the draft national coal logistics policy. Reuters Graphics Coal trucking has led to protests by villagers as trucks kick up dust and pollute farms and water sources with ash. Rajendra Naik a resident of Ratanpur village in Sundergarh district in eastern Odisha state said the number of trucks transporting coal in his area had nearly doubled in recent months. We are almost imprisoned in a dust chamber. It is difficult to breathe said Naik a 40yearold activist who has been fighting coal transportation by road along with other villagers.

The core CPI likely rose by 0.4 monthonmonth in March according to economists polled by Reuters. That would be down from the 0.5 increase in February but well above the pace required for bringing annual inflation to Feds 2 target. This will probably bolster expectations of a 25 basispoint bps hike by the Fed in May following a strong jobs report last week said a private bank trader. Those bets were currently near 74 according to Fed funds futures. Despite fairly subdued markets in the runup to Fed minutes and CPI there is every chance of swings one way or another on outcomeexpectations gap Mizuho bank analysts wrote in a note. The dollar index hovered near Tuesdays lows while most Asian currencies rose slightly. Minutes of the Feds March meeting where it hiked rates but sounded dovish are also due later in the day. The hike was interpreted as possibly the last one given the banking turmoil however a calming of the crisis and strong data since then has caused market repricing of the Fed peak rate. Meanwhile Indias inflation data reading is likely to show headline CPI eased in March to 5.80 dipping below the Reserve Bank of Indias upper tolerance limit of 6 for the first time this year according to a Reuters poll.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.2 in March. However core CPI remained elevated which analysts warned could be a cause for concern. Moreover minutes from the Feds March meeting revealed worries among members regarding the banking crisis with staff projections of a mild recession later this year. That sent the dollar index down 0.6 overnight while U.S. bond yields dropped in anticipation of Fed rate cuts. Futures showed the expectations of a 25basis point bps hike from the Fed next month were near 71 with that likely being the final hike before rates are cut from July onwards. Concerns about growth rather than inflation are likely to keep central bankers busy over the next 12 months said Anindya Banerjee head of research  FX and interest rates at Kotak Securities. With inflation down and the economy stagnating central banks may not be able to ignore the need for lower interest rates for much longer and the markets have started to factor that in. Hence the dollar may continue to be pressured he added. The rupees gains during the day may be capped due to mixed cues and rising crude prices said a staterun bank trader. Brent crude futures jumped to more than 87 per barrel overnight near their 2023 highs. Asian currencies strengthened while equities declined as Hong Kong tech shares were sold off.

U.S. Consumer Price Index CPI climbed 0.1 last month below economists expectations of a 0.2 gain and down from a 0.4 increase in February.

The dollar index fell 0.4 and U.S. 2year bond yield slipped below 4 as the inflation print was followed by minutes from the Feds March meeting which revealed concern among several members regarding the regional bank liquidity crisis. The expectations of a 25 basis point bps hike from the Fed at the May meeting were still near 71 with a peak rate of about 5.0 and cuts beginning in the secondhalf of the year. It is probably reasonable to factor in some recession worries and Fed cuts to an extent but short of a rapid deterioration in data it is difficult to see the Fed cutting 200bps by end2024 wrote DBS analysts in a note. Most Asian currencies rose as the Thai baht and the South Korean won firmed. Equities in the region were broadly lower tracking Wall Streets weak finish overnight with Hong Kong shares .HSI leading losses. Meanwhile inflation in India decelerated too as softer food prices and lower base effect helped March CPI to come in at 5.66 down from 6.44 in the previous month and lower than a Reuters poll forecast of 5.80. This comes after the Reserve Bank of India unexpectedly held rates steady last week.

Some Indian refiners were paying in the United Arab Emirates dirham currency for Russian lowsulphur crude priced above the 60 a barrel cap using Bank of Baroda mainly to Dubaibased traders sources said. The Group of Seven economies the European Union and Australia set the price cap late last year to bar Western services and shipping from trading Russian oil unless sold at an enforced low price to deprive Moscow of funds for its Ukraine war. Bank of Baroda is extremely cautious in settling payments for Russian oil bought at levels above the price cap one of the sources said. They have told us no for settling payments for abovecap barrels the person said. The staterun lender told refiners last month that it would not settle payment from Russian barrels bought above the price cap the three sources said. Bank of Baroda did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Before the Ukraine war Indian refiners rarely bought oil from Russia due to higher freight costs. After Western sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine Indian refiners have been gorging on discounted Russian oil. Russia has replaced Iraq as the top oil supplier to India in the last few months data from trade sources showed. Sources anticipate that prices of Russian sweet crude such as Sokol and ESPO Blend which was sold near 60 a barrel in recent weeks could breach the price cap due to a sharp spike in global oil prices triggered by Sundays OPEC decision to cut output. Some refiners mainly private operators have been clearing payments in dirhams for Russian crude through private lender Axis Bank AXBK.NS sources told Reuters last month. It was not clear if Axis Bank had also stopped settling trades for Russian oil sold above the price cap. Axis Bank did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Although Indian refiners buy Russian oil on a delivered basis copies of invoices reviewed by Reuters also show shipping charges which helps in calculating the price of crude at Russian ports. Sources said that problems in settling trade for Russian oil could push sellers to accept rupee payments at least for barrels that exceed the price cap. We have neither stopped nor reduced purchases of Russian oil after Bank of Barodas decision ... we will consider using rupees to pay for oil purchased above the price cap another source said. India does not recognise the Western price cap on Russian oil a senior oil ministry source said last month. SETTLEMENT MECHANISM India set up a mechanism to settle its international trade in rupees last year. Some Russian banks later opened vostro accounts with banks in India to facilitate rupee trade. The mechanism has not yet started given the lack of Russian appetite for rupees and Indias trade deficit with Moscow. However during a visit last week to India Igor Sechin chief executive of Russian oil major Rosneft discussed ways to expand cooperation with India across the hydrocarbons value chain including the possibility of making payments in national currencies. A switch to rupee payments would help wean Russia from dollars and would save foreign exchange for India.

Emissions from the worlds most populous country are only 7 of greenhouse gases but are growing fast while those produced by rich countries have largely peaked. If India avoids the dirty path to development that others including China have taken everyone will have a better chance of avoiding climate hell. India would have a lot to gain too. A stepup of investment in lowcarbon development could provide good jobs cut air pollution and increase energy security says Navroz Dubash from the Centre for Policy Research an Indian think tank. It would also position the oil importer well as global trade restructures along green lines and in favour of goods produced with a low carbon footprint. This would be a massive undertaking. Prime Minister Narendra Modis government has committed to decarbonise the economy by 2070. Many experts think India needs to go even faster. The consultancy group McKinsey for example calls for a 11 trillion investment to fund an accelerated scenario that completes most of the work by 2050. India will need to attract the lions share of the funding for the required electricity storage green hydrogen and other clean technologies as well as to ramp up renewable energy from private sources. To do so it will need policies that incentivise green investment including accelerating its plans for carbon pricing. Rich countries can also help even at a time when their budgets are stretched. They can provide guarantees so cutting the cost of capital for private investors. They can also get the World Bank to step up its climate investment  an idea which India is pushing for and which is likely to figure prominently at the World Bank and International Monetary Funds spring meetings this week. KNOTTY ISSUES The Group of Seven G7 rich industrial nations has sought to interest India in a Just Energy Transition Partnership JETP following similar deals struck with Indonesia Vietnam and South Africa. These pledged financing partly to help retire coal power plants early. But the Modi government would prefer to work through the Group of 20 G20 large economies which it is chairing this year says Vaibhav Chaturvedi of CEEW an Indian climate think tank. It would like to present a broad framework on how to promote green development for emerging economies rather than focussing on running down coal. Modis government doesnt want to single out the black stuff which accounted for 73 of electricity generation in the last financial year and is the only fossil fuel it mines in significant amounts. India worries its electricity grid would become unreliable if solar and wind power which is cheaper to produce but not generated around the clock plays too big a role in the energy mix  though this could be fixed if it ramped up storage. It is also concerned because millions of people work in or are dependent on the coal industry. HOLISTIC PLAN Even if a deal comes under the G20 it will still be the G7 plus others such as the Gulf states that provide help through finance technology and trade opportunities. If the G7 doesnt single out coal and takes a broader view of the overall path of Indias greenhouse gas emissions a grand bargain may be possible. India could then be much more ambitious in its transition plan and the G7 and other rich countries could mobilise funds focussing on key bottlenecks. Theres an opportunity too to fix Indias bust electricity distribution companies which are mostly owned by the countrys states and represent a major blockage in the energy transition. These discoms fail to pay their bills on time to power generators because politicians want them to subsidise power to retail consumers and farmers. They made a collective loss of over 2.3 trillion rupees 28 billion in 20192020 before subsidies and other support  equivalent to 1.2 of gross domestic product. This is a tricky political problem. But if the central government comes up with a solution rich countries could help fund it. Investors would then stop worrying whether the discoms would pay them  and more money would flow to where it is needed for India to curb its emissions faster. Green growth would also help Indian exporters such as JSW SteelJSTL.NS avoid the carbon tariffs the European Union and probably Britain are planning to introduce on dirty imports. That provides another incentive to do a deal for a country with big ambitions to establish itself as a global manufacturing hub and as a supply chain alternative to China. For much of this to work the United States would need to dial down the protectionism in its Inflation Reduction Act which subsidises clean technology made in America. India along with European countries and Canada has criticised the legislation for sucking green investment away from the rest of the world and called for America to find a way out for its trusted partners. There are undoubtedly many obstacles to a climate deal between rich countries and India. But the prize is so great that both sides should bust a gut to overcome them.

REUTERSAditya Kalra Summary Summary Companies Delhi authorities have not granted Pernod licence company says Top brands such as Chivas Absolut vodka not available in Delhi Pernod facing many business regulatory challenges in India NEW DELHI April 3 Reuters  Drinks giant Pernod Ricard PERP.PA is facing massive losses to business in India because its brands have not been available in the capital New Delhi for six months due to a licence issue delay according to documents and sources. The issue is the latest business headache for the French spirits group in India a key growth market. Pernod has operated for more than 20 years in Delhi and across India where licences to operate are granted by states individually and in most cases have to be renewed every year. In a court filing dated March 27 which is not public Pernod told a judge that it applied for a new Delhi city regulatory licence in August 2022 but the city government has still not issued a licence excluding the company from city bars and liquor shops. Pernod said in the filing it is being severely impacted with loss of market share and revenues and unable to conduct its business in the city adding that as a consequence it was suffering massive losses. Without quantifying the loss Pernod said that it has been suffering and continues to suffer significant business losses which are increasing with every passing day adding consumers had been deprived of access to its brands. Two sources familiar with Pernods issues said its top brands Chivas Regal Blenders Pride 100 Pipers and Absolut vodka were not currently available in Delhi city. The Delhi city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Pernod declined to comment for this story. Pernod has faced regulatory challenges in India for months. It is fighting a near 250 million tax demand for allegedly undervaluing imports and faces a federal investigation for alleged violations of Delhi citys liquor policy in 2021 that has led to the arrest of one executive. Pernod denies any wrongdoing. Last week a Delhi High Court judge asked the local government to decide within two weeks whether to issue a license to Pernod. The company counts India as a key market where it has a 17 share and competes with Diageo DGE.L. While the market share for New Delhi alone is not available industry sources say that as an urban tourist hub the city serves as a showcase market for premium brands making it critical for any liquor company. In its court filing Pernod says Delhi authorities in September approved the companys licence application and the company deposited a fee of 276000. But the city licence has not been issued yet and the authorities have not given any reason for the delay Pernod says. Mayank Bhatt CEO of Impresario Entertainment  Hospitality which runs popular restaurantbar chains Social and Smoke House Deli said the absence of Pernod brands in Delhi had left many customers disappointed and forced to settle for whatever other options are available. Absolut is an Absolut. To come and not get a brand you prefer takes away from the guest experience and hinders business he said.

New season wheat has started arriving on the market but the harvest has lost lustre in some districts because of the recent rainfall said a senior government official who declined to be named.

The source didnt wish to be identified in line with official rules. The central state of Madhya Pradesh is the second biggest producer of wheat after the northern state of Punjab. Wheat crop has also been damaged in Punjab and Haryana because of rainfall in the past few days and the government would be forced to make similar changes in the procurement rules for these states said a NewDelhibased trader with a global trade house. Punjab Haryana and Madhya Pradesh accounted for more than 98 of the total wheat procured in 2022. Crop with lower lustre was getting sold at a big discount to good quality crop in the market and the government buying would stop this distress sale the trader said.

Gandhi 52 was convicted last month in a case brought by a state lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party BJP after comments Gandhi made in a 2019 speech were deemed to be insulting to the prime minister and other people surnamed Modi. The first hearing will be on April 13 Hiral Panwala a member of Gandhis legal team told Reuters. In this struggle truth is my weapon and truth is my support! Gandhi tweeted after he left the crowded court complex in Surat city in the western state of Gujarat waving to supporters and Congress members who had gathered in large numbers. Gandhi was accompanied by his younger sister Priyanka Vadra en route from the airport to the court in a bus with large windows through which Gandhi waved at supporters. Gandhis conviction hinged on a comment he made while campaigning ahead of the last general election when he referred to two fugitive businessmen both surnamed Modi and asked How come all thieves have the name Modi? Prime Minister Modi and his BJP swept back to power in that election. Gandhis Congress recorded its worst performance ever winning 52 seats in the 542member lower house of parliament. A magistrates court in Surat last month ruled that Gandhi had defamed everyone with the surname Modi but his lawyer said Gandhi had been referring to Prime Minister Modi and the two businessmen while talking about accusations of highlevel corruption. The 2019 speech was not aimed at defaming millions of people having the surname Modi Panwala told Reuters. Gandhi will not have to attend the April 13 hearing. Two more defamation cases have been filed elsewhere against Gandhi for the same comment and he is due to appear in court in one of them in the eastern city of Patna on April 12. Gandhi is at the centre of opposition politics and the main target of Modis BJP even though Gandhis Congress party is a shadow of its former self and the BJP looks set to dominate the next general election. Opposition politicians say his trial and his disqualification from parliament are the latest example of the governments strongarm tactics following various investigations and legal troubles faced recently by some opposition members. BJP leaders reject that and say Gandhis case represents the Congress partys arrogance and its readiness to hurt sections of society to settle political scores with the prime minister.

REUTERSThomas WhiteIllustration MUMBAI March 29 Reuters  Indian foreign exchange traders are betting on a rise in dollarrupee forward premiums as U.S. interest rates are expected to ease later this year bankers and analysts said. The USDINR 1year implied yield is forecast to rise to 3 levels within fiscal 2024 from around 2.40 currently according to market participants. The 1year implied yield is down about 140 basis points bps over the last 12 months. Forward premiums a function of U.S. and India interest rate differentials are expected to widen as the Federal Reserve is likely to ease rates gradually this year while the Reserve Bank of India keeps them steady economists said. Fed futures suggest the U.S. central bank is likely to cut rates by about 60 bps from its peak this year. At the height of worries over the U.S. banking sector earlier this month nearly 100 bps of rate cuts were priced in. USDINR 1year forward premium yield could go to 3. For that we would need at least two rate cuts from the Fed said Anindya Banerjee head of research  FX and interest rates at Kotak Securities. The market is pricing in two to three rate cuts by December as generally when the Fed starts the process it cuts rates quite fast because they are doing so in a crisis Banerjee said. Far forwards have been getting paid lately due to these Fed expectations said a chief forex dealer at a public sector bank. From trading near 2.20 earlier in March the 1year yield has firmed to as much as 2.50. The yield curve which is currently flat will steepen as the fiscal year progresses the trader said. According to traders the Fed rate cuts would also improve the outlook for inflows into Indian markets and the RBI at some point could step in to limit the rupees appreciation. This provides another reason to pay forwards an interest rate trader at a large foreign bank said. The RBI has in recent months bought dollars when the rupee rallied to likely shore up its reserves. To avoid the impact of its spot intervention on rupee liquidity the central bank has been paying or doing sellbuy swaps in the forwards market pushing premiums higher according to traders.

The miner which accounts for 80 of Indias annual coal output is targeting production of 780 million tonnes in the upcoming fiscal year in a bid to fire its power utilities which are expected to burn about 8 more coal in the year. Indias coalfired power output has increased much faster than any other country in the Asia Pacific since Russias invasion of Ukraine underscoring the challenges the worlds thirdlargest greenhouse gas emitter faces in weaning its economy off carbon. The government has previously cited lower per capita emissions compared with richer nations and surging renewable energy output when asked about rising coal use. Coal accounts for nearly 75 of Indias power generation and utilities account for more than 75 of its coal use. India is the worlds second largest producer consumer and importer of the fuel.

My only offline spends are bars and restaurants when I go to meet friends said the 24yearold engineering graduate. Vahia is one among Indias young and aspirational 1.4 billion population whose propensity for online spending has attracted global companies and digital platforms. And as private consumption underpins economic growth in India financial investors are targetting new ways to tap into it. China saw a jump in consumption from 2006 when as per World Bank data its per capita gross domestic product GDP crossed 2000. India crossed that threshold in 2021 according to the banks latest available data which could put it on a similar growth trajectory even though weak job growth and income inequalities in the country pose a risk to this outcome. With the cheapest mobile data rates in the world thanks to intense competition among telecoms providers and the explosive growth of social media and personal entertainment Indian consumers are going digital at a breakneck pace. It has nearly 700 million smartphone users who rating agency ICRA estimates consume an average of almost 17 GB in mobile data per month higher than the 13 GB in China and the 15 GB in North America. An urban consumer in India can see what consumers are consuming in developed countries and a rural consumer can see what an urban consumer is doing. This aspirationled consumption boost has the potential to provide a material fillip to discretionary consumption in years to come said Priyanka Khandelwal fund manager at ICICI Prudential Asset Management. Reuters Graphics PHYSICAL TO DIGITAL For investors not only newage Indian tech companies but also traditional consumer firms that are adding digital capabilities offer a route to tap the consumption theme. Opportunities for gaining exposure poured in for them when platforms that cater to online commerce including food delivery specialist Zomato ZOMT.NS FSN ECommerce Ventures FSNE.NS which runs beauty and fashion sales platform Nykaa SoftBankbacked logistics firm Delhivery DELH.NS and payment firm Paytm PAYT.NS listed recently in the Indian markets. Bain  Co estimates that Indias online shopping market hit 50 billion in 2022 with an online shopper base of 180190 million  the third largest in the world after China and the U.S. Investors can play the online and digital consumption boom in India directly via the tech companies enabling this space or indirectly via supported industries such as logistics or fintech said Kunjal Gala head of global emerging markets at Federated Hermes. Traditional businesses currently suffering from poor penetration and low per capita usage offer another promising avenue for investors. Indias per capita consumption of food was at 314 in 2020 compared to 884 for China while that of clothing stood at 53.9 versus 212.9 for China data from CLSA showed. Per capita spending on health related items in India was 56.8 in 2020 and 389.3 for China the data showed. A pattern will continue to repeat for years in India industry after industry emerging from a long period of underpenetration and moving up the per capita consumption scale said Vikas Pershad portfolio manager for Asian equities at MG Investments. The range of industries will span healthcare delivery hospitals to cars and twowheelers to housing finance companies and cement. As the incomes and wealth of Indians rise their aspirational needs will see demand ramp up for packaged food and beverages branded goods travel preventive healthcare and personal care said ICICI Prudentials Khandelwal and the funds chief investment officer S Naren. FOREIGN INVESTORS JUMP IN With private consumption accounting for 60 of Indias 3.5 trillion GDP foreign portfolio investors have been quick to latch on. They pumped in a net 2.7 billion in four key consumption sectors  automobiles consumer durables consumer services and FMCG in the first 11 months of the financial year 202223 AprilMarch according to data from Indias National Securities Depository Ltd. In contrast the broader Indian equity markets saw an outflow of 5.9 billion. To be sure it has not been all smooth sailing for investors as they chased Indias consumption boom. Shares of the newage technology companies have tumbled since their listings and while they now trade at more reasonable valuations they are still pricey compared to the industry median. And most traditional consumerfocused companies also trade at valuations above the benchmark index. Reuters Graphics Indian equities remain quite expensive both on a historical and relative basis compared to China for instance said David Chao global market strategist at Invesco Asia Pacific who sees outsized growth in segments like quick service restaurants and consumer durables. But investors have to look beyond that he said.

India has become a big market for the Cupertino Californiabased company which launched an online retail store in the worlds secondlargest smartphone market in 2020. Still due to its high prices Apple has only a 3 share of Indias smartphone market. Apple has previously faced hurdles in opening physical retail stores in the country with 2021 launch plans delayed because of the COVID19 pandemic. Apple products however have been sold in India for years on ecommerce platforms such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Walmart Incs WMT.N Flipkart as well as through resellers. India is also increasingly becoming a manufacturing base with some Apple products including iPhones assembled in the country by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturers Foxconn 2317.TW and Wistron Corp 3231.TW. Apple also plans to assemble iPads and AirPods in India. The first retail store is located in the premier Reliance Jio World Drive mall home to various luxury clothing and jewellery brands like Michael Kors Kate Spade and Swarovski. The brightlylit store was inspired by the iconic Kaali Peeli taxi art unique to Mumbai Apple said in a statement referring to the citys decadesold yellow and black taxis. People were taking selfies and recording videos on their smartphones outside the store on Wednesday evening with the Apple logo decked out in a variety of colours and a version of the classic Apple greeting showing Hello Mumbai.

Total March crude imports were estimated by Refinitiv Oil Research at 116.73 million tonnes equivalent to 27.60 million barrels per day bpd. This was up almost 4 from Februarys 112.32 million tonnes but down 6.1 on a daily basis from Februarys 29.4 million bpd and also below Januarys 29.13 million bpd. However the first three months of 2023 were stronger than every month in 2022 except for November when Asias crude imports were 29.10 million bpd. Despite the lower daily imports in March it has been a strong start to the year for Asias oil imports with the first quarter seeing arrivals of 28.67 million bpd up 6.3 from the 26.96 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2022. The numbers support some of the bullish narrative in oil markets which has been centred on a strong rebound in demand from China as the worlds biggest crude importer reopens its economy after ending its strict zeroCOVID policy at the end of last year. Chinas March imports were assessed by Refinitiv at a fourmonth high of 49.26 million tonnes equivalent to 11.65 million bpd which is almost 1 million bpd above Februarys 10.66 million bpd. Saudi Arabia reclaimed its place as Chinas top supplier with 8.08 million tonnes or a share of 16.4 edging out Russia at 7.95 million tonnes or a share of 16.1. Russia and Saudi Arabia have vied for the top spot among Chinas suppliers since Moscows invasion of Ukraine led to Russian oil exporters offering steep discounts to Asian buyers as their markets in Europe dried up as a result of sanctions. While Russian volumes into China remain high by prewar standards its worth noting that Refinitiv data shows India competing with China for Russian cargoes loading at Pacific ports. Asia crude imports vs Brent price ESPO TO INDIA India has also turned to cheap Russian oil but has mainly bought the Urals grade which loads at Russias western ports and then has to travel through the Suez Canal or around the bottom of Africa to reach India. However India bought some 400000 tonnes of Pacificloading ESPO crude in March which in turn led China to import 1.56 million tonnes of Urals a record high volume of this grade. Indias crude imports rose to an 11month high of 21.23 million tonnes or about 5.02 million bpd in March with Russia supplying 34 of the total or 7.29 million tonnes which was a sixth straight record high. Overall China and India continue to drive Asias crude imports but the rising share of Russian oil does raise the question as to the impact on other suppliers and whether they are seeing reduced demand. There are some areas of concern in Asias crude imports with the regions thirdbiggest buyer Japan taking just 10.67 million tonnes in March or about 2.52 million bpd which was the lowest since June 2022. Lower refinery utilisation and a draw on oil inventories suggest that demand in Japan is soft and refiners are concerned about high prices. Looking at other major importers South Koreas arrivals surged to a record high of 3.33 million bpd and Singapores imports were also strong. Taiwans dipped but the main point of concern was the rest of Asia outside the top six importers where arrivals dropped to 12.87 million tonnes in March down from 14.36 million in February. This suggests weakness in much of Southeast Asia and South Asia outside of India and provides a counterpoint to the bullish China and India narrative.

A Prasanna head of research at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership was in the minority of analysts that had expected the RBI to pause rate hikes at its meeting on Thursday. By the next meeting in June if inflation data is in line or slightly better and globally if we get an indication that the U.S. Federal Reserve is done with hikes then I think their RBIs conviction will also grow said Prasanna. So then that pause can get extended in the next meeting. The central banks surprise decision to hold its key repo rate INREPOECI steady at 6.50 after six consecutive hikes sent the benchmark 10year bond yield tumbling to a near sevenmonth low of 7.15. However yields recovered from their session lows as RBI officials repeated several times that they could resume rate hikes at its meeting in June. This is the only way they could have paused by combining it with the option to hike in the future said Prasanna. If they had combined it with more dovish commentary then the market would have gone ahead and started pricing in cuts also. The decision on future rate hikes will depend on whether inflation runs above the RBIs projections of an average of 5.2 in 202324 compared to 6.44 in February. That makes March and April data key said Prasanna who expects that inflation can even go below 5 by April. Inflation has stayed above the RBIs upper tolerance limit of 6 for most of the last financial year including in January and February. Expectations from the U.S. Federal Reserve which will be clearer by the time the RBI meets in June will be an important input as well said Prasanna. Despite growing expectations of a prolonged pause ISECPD expects bond yields to remain rangebound after Thursdays fall. While this pause is positive the supply of government bonds also remains high said Prasanna. The impact of recent tax changes on inflows into debt mutual funds also needs to be assessed he said.

UPI is an instant realtime payments system that allows users to transfer money across multiple banks without disclosing bank account details. UPI which currently involves transactions between deposit accounts or wallets will now expand further to credit lines given by banks RBI deputy governor Rabi Sankar said at a press conference after the central banks monetary policy decision. The move could potentially reduce the number of cards held by a customer Sankar added. UPIs popularity is seen to have reduced the usage of cash and debit cards for daily transactions. It recorded 8.65 billion transactions in March amounting to 14.05 trillion rupees its highestever since inception data from the National Payments Corporation of India showed. The RBIs latest move is likely to increase the use case for UPI and allow banks to experiment with products and reduce the cost of offerings said a senior banker at a large staterun bank. It will be a huge disruptor for both the credit card market and the buynowpaylater segment the banker added. They did not wish to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. In a bid to boost digital payments the RBI recently allowed RuPay credit cards to be linked to UPI. This was to enable customers to link their credit cards and pay via UPI. However this did not move the needle for private sector banks as most credit cards they issued were on the Visa and Mastercard settlement systems said Shivaji Thapliyal head of research and lead analyst at YES Securities. With presanctioned credit lines now proposed private sector banks can now simply offer credit cardlike products to anyone who has a UPI relationship with the bank Thapliyal added.

New Delhi this year approved a 174.9 billion rupee incentive plan to promote green hydrogen in a bid to cut carbon dioxide emissions and become a major exporter in the sector. The government will give incentives worth at least 30 Indian rupees per kg for production of green hydrogen fuel the official who is directly involved but did not want to be identified because the discussions are private told Reuters. The cost of manufacturing green hydrogen which is made using renewable energy rather than power derived from fossil fuels in India is currently at about 300 rupees per kg. In response to a query from Reuters Indias Renewable Energy Secretary Bhupinder Singh Bhalla said the incentives will be awarded through a competitive bidding process and the incentive amount will taper down annually. Draft concept notes on the programme have been circulated to industry chambers and associations for consultations he said. Of the total incentive plan for the sector the government will award about 130 billion rupees for producing green hydrogen and rest will be for manufacturing electrolysers which are used to split hydrogen and oxygen molecules using electricity. India has set targets for half of its installed electricity capacity to be from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030 and for the country to attain netzero carbon emissions by 2070. The government will start the bidding for firms seeking incentives before the end of this quarter the source said adding that the government expects to support 3.6 million tonnes of hydrogen production capacity in the next three years under the scheme. The government will invite bids in three tranches for green hydrogen supply and in two tranches for electrolysers the official said adding that this will help gain market insights and to absorb new technologies and realise cost reductions. The auction for green hydrogen supply is expected to be open to companies which have renewable energy plants or produce hydrogen and ammonia. Companies seeking the lowest incentive will be awarded the contracts the source said. Indian companies such as Reliance Industries RELI.NS Indian Oil IOC.NS NTPC NTPC.NS Adani Enterprises ADEL.NS JSW Energy JSWE.NS ReNew Power RENE.BO and Acme Solar ACMO.NS that have already announced plans for green hydrogen are expected to be interested in the contracts. Each tranche for manufacturing of electrolysers is likely to be for 1500 megawatts MW of capacity with the incentive fixed at 4440 rupees per kilowatt the official said. The government expects to support about 3000 megawatts of annual electrolyser capacity for five years through the scheme with the first tranches in this quarter and the next in the third quarter of 2023.
