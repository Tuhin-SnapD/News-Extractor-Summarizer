of Londons Chinatown was once one of the most beautiful in the city Now its one of the most dynamic As Xu a Taiwanesestyle tea house it was a stage set of 1920s polish and clean lines The walls were partpanelled in block marquetry and there were booths upholstered in leather the colour of caf au lait There were sexy wall sconces and flashes of marble trim and tiny private dining rooms built cleverly into the small space You came here for crisply fried pork buns and pleated dumplings in puddles of jadegreen broth It was at first shocking to see all of that stripped out to make way for Speedboat Bar Now the downstairs walls are tiled in an institutional sludge green Upstairs theyre painted yellow against the turquoise window frames Theres a pool table to drink powerful cocktails over while you play and giant TVs screening sports There are stainlesssteel tables and dozens of tiny pictures of Bangkok street life as if acquired over decades of trade rather than put up for the opening a couple of months ago And oh the clamour Top marks for upholstering the underneath of the tables to help deaden the sound Clams arrive in a broth thick with sweet chilli jam and outrageously

the bottle I order a bowl of deepfried chicken skins the brown of a velour sofa They are still warm and curled in on each other and an irresistible saltysour As I scarf the lot I finally clock that this new space is just as clever and just as beguiling an exercise in restaurant stagesetting as its previous incarnation This makes sense The restaurant may have changed but the business behind it remains the same Both involved the Sethi brothers company JKS Restaurants They have an impressive spread of ventures from the Mayfair Indian Gymkhana through the Iranian kebab house Berenjak to the Bao group of which the now closed Xu was a part JKS has many talents One of them is choosing their chefrestaurateur partners With Speedboat Bar its the British chef Luke Farrell who has been bouncing back and forth between Dorset London and Thailand for many years now investigating southern Thai cooking He brings in cuttings of Thai herbs and plants to grow here in glasshouses on his fathers farm because they are diminished by being imported frozen Warm and curled in on each other and an irresistible saltysour chicken skins Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer The first restaurant he opened with JKS was Plaza Khao Gaeng a southern Thai caf in the upstairs space above their Arcade food court at the base of Centrepoint There he serves fierce dishes of dryfried pork or sea bream with permutations of chillies wild galangal and makrut limes Its food to make you gasp and blink and go back for more Farrell has described Speedboat Bar as his tribute to the fullon cafs along the neongilded Yaowarat Road in Bangkoks Chinatown Everything here is vivid and candycoloured and maximum wattage including the food Look at the bright orange sweetsour dipping sauce with the sweetcorn fritters the golden lacy batter pitted with the brilliant yellow of corn kernels Or theres the ludicrously green prawn ceviche served whole and peeled apart from the tail which can act as a handle Use it to help you dredge the prawn through the rugged lake of lime chilli and fish sauce that makes your lips tingle and your brow sweat Speedboats homage to the restaurants of Bangkoks Chinatown is felt in various ways A salad of pickled mustard greens comes layered with slices of dense deepred winddried Chinese sausage Drunkards seafood and beef noodles is so named our Thai waiter explains because it was first devised as a hangover cure from whatever was hanging around in the fridge Its a good reason to get liquored up There are broad ribbon noodles and slices of quickfried beef and curls of squid in a thickened sweet soy Cantonesestyle sauce If youre with nonmeat eaters watch out for the Naem fried rice mined with tiny cubes of pork Introduce some of the sweet vinegary dressing from the saucer on the side Allow sliced red and green chillies according to taste Ludicrously green prawn ceviche Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer Other things come from the more obviously Thai side of the

are cooked down until their skins are crinkled and their flesh creamy A crispy pork curry walks both sides of the line The sliced meat has crackling with the crunch and shatter that I associate with Cantonese roast meats The dark brown sauce has the coconut and palm sugar sweetness that I associate with a massaman Taken dish by dish its obviously huge fun To keep to the retro 60s vibe each one is like a frame from an old Batman comic fight scene Kapow Wham Biff The problem is that cumulatively like the bar upstairs throbbing and thronging with young people necking those whisky sodas it can all become a little relentless Wave after wave of sweet and fiery and sour crashes on the wilder shores of your tongue This may however be down to the nature of reviewing which demands overordering for I am nothing if not conscientious Perhaps come here for a beer and just a couple of plates and then move on Outside is a ropedoff area of the pavement with red plastic stools around the tables On warm summer nights people passing by will want to be inside that rope rather than outside A flaky golden rectangle pineapple pie Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer There is just one dessert a flaky golden rectangle of deepfried pineapple pie It reminds me fondly of a McDonalds apple pie Its in keeping with the louche laidback mood If you want something else remember youre in Soho There are dessert

disappeared into the mouth of the 7615 chars,Theres a litre of water plus big bottles of shampoo sun lotion and mouthwash sloshing around next to the clothes and laptop in my green wheelie case which has just disappeared into the mouth of the scanner at London City airport I had even recklessly bunged in my makeup bag After years of being conditioned to travel with micro toiletries my heart is beating faster Im waiting for a klaxon to go off and my unholy trinity of familysize Pantene Soltan and Listerine plus assorted cosmetics to be unceremoniously dumped in one of the sin bins that have been stationed by security lanes since the mid2000s But Nothing Happens Apart from some raised eyebrows at the vat of mouthwash The east London hub has from Tuesday officially become the first mainstream UK airport to end the tyranny of tiny toiletries that has held sway since 2006 when the 100ml limit on liquids pastes and gels in hand baggage was first introduced after a foiled transatlantic bomb plot to use explosive liquids disguised as soft drinks Now passengers flying out of the Docklands airport can carry liquids and gels in containers of up to 2 litres in their hand baggage after it upgraded its baggage screening system to the latest CT computed tomography scanners which provide a 3D image of the contents of passengers bag The technology also works for electronics meaning the slow process of depositing belongings on to multiple trays has gone Instead security staff cheerfully tell passengers to leave everything inside your bags  enabling people to file through at a much faster rate City announced the planned changeover last year beginning with a trial security lane before gradually switching the rest over With all four now upgraded the airport claims to have Londons fastest security experience Waiting for her morning flight to Ibiza Lynne Schey has just breezed through It was gorgeous a morning present I asked for a plastic bag to put things in but they said I didnt need one Phenomenal Like the rest of us Schey had got used to the strict rules with travellers all part of the same army carrying their makeup and medicines in a little plastic bag for all to see You started being more discerning with no makeup and lots of little containers with little bits of this and that in she says Occasionally you would forget though and cause a pile up with a bottle of water Sisters Laura and Ruth Stephenson were amazed how quickly they had got through security Photograph Graeme RobertsonThe Guardian Its the end of miniature toiletries agrees Alison FitzGerald the airports chief operating officer The longrunning restrictions resulted in a very tense environment in the security area It makes it really stressful Youve got to get all this stuff out of your bag and feel under pressure to be quick People were also upset at being made to throw away expensive items such as perfume or face cream Staff were always saying you cant take that you cant do that FitzGerald says but now the conversations are more positive With the new scanners able to process up to 550 trays an hour each lane passengers are moving through the airport more quickly We are getting 30 more passengers through an hour says FitzGerald Its much less stressful from a passenger point of view The information thats provided to the security officer is much more enhanced so the threat detection has improved significantly With nearly 4 million passengers expected to pass through this year London City is the first major UK airport to be able to fully relax the liquid rule Smaller rival Teesside International dropped it in March after it replaced its two scanners Trials are under way at other airports including Heathrow However other hubs stressed that for now current restrictions remain in place and passengers must still remove tablets laptops and liquids from their cabin baggage with the usual 100ml limit and plastic bag rules At peak travel times like this weekends Easter getaway travellers are greeted with bins overflowing with bottles of water and outsized toiletries from those who forgot the rules perhaps because Covid stopped them from travelling for so long In the UK the government has set a deadline of June 2024 for large airports to install the new screening equipment spelling the eventual end to the 100ml rule To date Australia and the Netherlands are the only other countries to have mandated the upgrade although trials are taking place around the world skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily

period of confusion for travellers who may encounter different security regimes on the flight out and on the way home says Nicky Kelvin head of travel advice website The Points Guy Anybody traveling with hand baggage will need to check what the current trial or rule is for the place they are travelling from and to he says If you are a transit passenger you will need to be even more careful Of course you can still check a bag in if you need to but its expensive Sisters Laura and Ruth Stephenson are eating breakfast in the City departure lounge waiting for their flight to Florence to be called Laura says she was amazed how quickly they had got through security Ruth used to travel with a massive bag of makeup and skincare but is more restrained these days The world may be changing again but for this trip anyway her beauty essentials still fit into the smallest bag known to man she says waving an airport issue plastic bag that is barely a quarter full During the pandemic hand sanitiser shot to the top of the list of confiscated items Weirdly Marmite and snow globes are a big problem too says FitzGerald Marmite counts as a paste under the liquid regulations while snow globes are not marked with a volume measure We always had to confiscate them even if they were small she says Both the old and new generation of scanners use Xray imaging but the camera in the older machines is stationary resulting in a 2D image whereas in a CT scanner it spins It takes a number of photos in a very short amount of time of your cabin baggage so we can create a 3D image but also do a bunch of detection to look for bad things says Jonathan Stone aviation solutions division manager at the US firm Leidos which supplied the new scanners at London City The new machines also put detection capability into the hands of algorithms and science as opposed to relying solely on humans The new scanners come at a price with an estimated 10000 to 15000 scanners to replace globally at a cost of about 200000 a machine However the investment should be recouped through higher takings in airport shops and lower staffing costs as the new systems require fewer security workers to monitor the equipment and herd passengers Its making the traveling public much safer number one and number two offering our airport customers the ability to modernise and optimise their security operations says Stone There will be a return on that investment as passengers spend more on duty free and less time in line for security For me there was no Ibiza or Florence It was just a dummy run However it did provide a salutary reminder of why leaving liquids at home can be no bad thing something blue leaked all over my clothes

Richardson and Beaumont for those unfamiliar are standup comics and in Richardsons case panel show royalty as an exteam captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats who also cohost Channel 4s Jon  Lucys Odd Couples casting judgment on other celeb relationships from their lofty celebrelationship pinnacle They are also stars of the hit mockumentary Meet the Richardsons which chronicles their married life  or a fictional version thereof That show majors in the tension between their fame and their glamourfree domestic life  and its the VIP launch of its new series that justifies all this current London luxury albeit for one day only If the show is to be believed theyll soon be back in the north of England squabbling being parents being neighbours and trying to catch a break in the rough and tough entertainment world But is the show to be believed None of it is real says Beaumont But we enjoy making it seem as if it is Another pause But then some things are If were successful and happy and calm you lose that fundamental element of comedy The series started life when its producer saw Jon and Lucy grumbling at each other on a TV show called Married to a Celebrity He proposed a mockumentary following the couple around at a particular moment in their shared lives We lived in a little village in West Yorkshire in the middle of nowhere says Beaumont Neither of us worked much I was getting back into things after having a daughter and you Jon were doing bits But we were cut off And we were hanging out with our neighbours Those neighbours were cast in the show alongside Beaumonts largerthanlife mum the playwright Gill Adams and a roster of celeb pals Rob Beckett Johnny Vegas David Tennant appearing as themselves while Jon and Lucy made hapless efforts to rebuild their TV careers What has emerged over four series is a show thats carved out its own comic niche in the same ballpark as Curb Your Enthusiasm but with added talking heads droll cutaways and moments of unadulterated documentary says Richardson amid the semiscripted larks Most importantly its a high gagrate comedy show he says and when hes filming if I can see the crew arent laughing its not in the show They should be laughing Beaumont agrees I was getting annoyed with comedydrama I felt like sitcom needed to get back to making people laugh every three lines It is Beaumont  also the cocreator of

opportunity as he bursts into flames at a childrens party while dressed as a monkey or  in the new series  disappoints his comedy hero Ben Elton Is it right to assume his haplessness and Beaumonts career anxiety are all exaggerated for comic effect she has after all been nominated for a Bafta for her performance Thats Lucys skill as a writer says Richardson To understand that sitcom is driven by a need If were successful and happy and calm you lose that fundamental element of comedy That said we went to Center Parcs recently says Beaumont and a lady in the toilet said to me Isnt it nice that your husbands let you be on telly with him And youre just like OK I can now go away and write a scene Even in real life she says I very much still feel like the jealous wife whos hungry for a career But she also feels  much to the consternation of the shows publicist within earshot  that Meet the Richardsons is becoming too careerfocused The new series is too workbased she says Its my least favourite You liked it in series one shoots back Richardson and you havent liked it since Were missing a bit of dock pudding says Beaumont  referring to the shows second episode when the duo judged the real not fictional World Dock Pudding cookery competition in Hebden Bridge I was like this is exactly what I want to be making says Beaumont I like it less when the show recreates a celebrity thing weve been to  I like it when were interacting with real people Watching the show you cant help but wonder how it affects the couples reallife relationship and whether there might be aspects of their private life theyd prefer to keep behind closed doors Richardson says not really In series four I shit myself in the car So its difficult to know what I would veto skip past

reality Their TV house is not their real house Their TV daughter is an actor Not that their fans see it that way Because were playing ourselves says Beaumont I do think people come up to us more in public and assume they know us Definitely Cast away  Jon and Lucy have a meeting at UKTV about the new series in Meet the Richardsons Photograph Adam LawrenceUKTVJames Stack Thats not a bad thing she says  and Richardson too can see upsides to their unusual televised lives Every couple argues he says but we have an end product for our arguments We hone them then put them on TV And then its like Oh perhaps we werent arguing  perhaps we were just working on a routine Are they concerned about becoming more famous as a couple than as individuals As long as I can do standup which is such a pure selfish moment I dont mind says Richardson now celebrating 20 years as one of the UKs finest comic curmudgeons As long as I can tour and thats just my voice  well thats such a privilege Beaumont too nominated best newcomer at the Edinburgh fringe back in 2014 is embarking on a standup tour Its title The Trouble and Strife suggests no great desire to slough off the Richardsons connection This first foray into standup in a decade has raised old demons for Beaumont which her new career as a successful TV writer has yet to slay I know now she says that what put me off standup was the horrific misogyny that I suffered Only a decade ago she says promoters still didnt want to book female comics comperes introduced them with an apology and youd get on stage and the audience would instantly look embarrassed before you said anything Or they would use you as the time to go to the toilet It led to her convincing herself that I dont belong here Im not good enough Im not funny Four series of a hit TV show later she says I still have all that in my head whenever I do anything And its really frustrating that men dont So my thing with the new tour is I just want to make it  like Meet the Richardsons before it  the funniest thing it can be Meet the Richardsons starts 6 April 10pm Dave  UKTV Play

unexpected open sesame in the form of Dr Jonathan Kennedy the director of the MSc and iBSc global public health programmes at Barts and the London Medical School and while he has his photograph taken up on one of its mezzanine floors Im free to wander around alone At least I think Im alone the museum is nothing if not ghostly On the same site as the hospital in the City of London this purposebuilt glassroofed Victorian building is home to about 4000 medical specimens the majority of them displayed on open shelves Every part of the body is represented and every kind of illness and injury  though tracking down a particular condition can be tricky for the nonmedical When I finally find the gnarled yellow spine of a patient who suffered from tuberculosis  I was after something that speaks to Kennedys new book which is about infectious disease and its effect on human civilisation  its largely down to luck The vertebrae in question just happen to be next to the museums most famous exhibit the skull of John Bellingham who assassinated the British prime minister Spencer Perceval in 1812 In Pathogenesis How Germs Made History there is no mention of Perceval But Bellinghams skull preserved after the dissection of his body that followed his hanging inevitably brings to mind Kennedys chapter on the Industrial Revolution  a period when previously uncommon pathogens such as TB and cholera began to thrive in our cities cholera did not appear in Europe until the 1830s having hitched a lift in both the guts and the linen of travellers from southeast Asia Not only did infectious diseases then account for 55 of deaths in London cholera epidemics in particular also led to a rise in the publics distrust of doctors who were sometimes attacked as they transported suspected sufferers to hospital for isolation The skull of John Bellingham the man who killed PM Spencer Perceval in 1812 a period when uncommon pathogens began to thrive in the UKs cities Photograph St Bart Pathology Museum Murderers bodies were sent for dissection by law as Bellinghams had been the medical profession was hungry for cadavers and this ensured a supply line However as Kennedy notes the 1828 murders committed by William Burke and William Hare who sold their victims bodies to Edinburgh Universitys medical school caused people to believe that cholera patients removed from their communities by doctors were about to be similarly dispatched The anatomists of course were absolutely right to compel isolation but most of their patients would indeed die even if they didnt kill them personally So far as treatments went doctors were clueless One of their more bizarre cures involved injecting turpentine and mutton stew into the patients intestines via the anus Kennedys book which aims to show how infectious disease has shaped us from the time of the Neanderthals to the era of Covid19 is full of amazing facts like these For days after I read it I kept thinking of Pope Clement VI who when the Black Death reached 14thcentury Avignon where he was exiled retired on the advice of his physician to his chamber seeing nobody and spending all day and all night between two great fires  the flames of which kept the rats that were carrying the disease at bay Clement did very well to survive Its estimated that somewhere in the region of 60 of the population of Europe about 50 million out of 80 million people died from the plague between 1346 and 1353 Meanwhile the economy more or less ground to a halt Kennedy is a sociologist who somehow ended up  he describes a meandering intellectual journey  in public health Before coronavirus I published a paper looking at the links between populism and vaccine confidence he says So when the outbreak started the rational thing to do as an academic might have been to get my hands dirty working on Covid19 But actually I struggled with the way my work was suddenly the news and so I went in a slightly different direction With Pathogenesis I wanted to broaden the discussion out In the pandemic most experts stopped saying this is an aberration pretty early on for the simple reason that if you look back you can see that it really isnt exceptional Over the course of human history it has been normal to have these pandemics that not only kill a lot of people and bring civilisations crashing down but which also sometimes create space for new kinds of societies to emerge The book is an intellectual response to the slightly myopic way some people viewed the pandemic Its a long view one that we couldnt perhaps take at the time because everyone was in such a panic Its hard to overstate the role that infectious diseases played in the foundation of the Spanish empire Pathogenesis doesnt only cover thousands of years of history  it seeks radically to alter the way the reader views many of the often very wellknown events it describes Having read recent research by scientists archaeologists and anthropologists for instance Kennedy suggests that Homo sapiens became the dominant species of human not as a result of any inherent intellectual superiority over Neanderthals but because our immune system was better suited to adapting to pathogens as we migrated north from Africa He also looks at the role disease played in colonisers ability or not to govern their empires Its generally accepted that Rome fell partly because of plague probably smallpox its armies weakened by illness But by his telling had it not been for an Ebolalike pandemic in the second century Christianity would never have become so widespread  a slightly more surprising analysis What part he asks did pathogens play in the nearmiraculous victories of conquistadors such as Hernn Corts and Francisco Pizarro in Central and South America in the early 16th century Kennedy as you will have gathered doesnt believe in the socalled great man theory of history He believes in the sick man theory of history for no soldier can march if he is dying and no king can rule who is weakened by infection With this book he set himself a mammoth task Where on earth did he start Well I guess my starting point was microbes he tells me were in a seminar room now far away from all the pickled lungs and hearts Within us there are 40 trillion bacteria Theyve evolved over millions of years and we now know theyre playing all sorts of roles in our lives This blows my mind and the question I wanted to ask as a sociologist was if these tiny things have such an influence on our bodies what kind of effect might they have on the body politic the body social the body economic Humans make history but not in circumstances of their own choosing Microbes are a huge force in creating those circumstances Ebola is just one of the many threats that humanity has faced in recent years Photograph Frederick MurphyAP Together we roam haphazardly over some of the history in his book I want to know what he found most mindboggling One thing that really came out of the whole project was the absolute baselessness of white ideology he says Obviously that comes to the fore when were discussing colonialism It seems bizarre to me now that people would put down Pizarros conquering of the Inca empire with only 168 troops to the fact that he had superior weapons Its hard to overstate the role that infectious diseases played in the foundation of the Spanish empire The Spanish brought smallpox with them among other diseases which devastated the Indigenous population This was followed by measles an infection now thought to have been similar to salmonella and flu Local populations fell by 90 The Spanish invaders interpreted all this as a sign that God supported them Yet we cling to assumptions about superiority Ever since we discovered the Neanderthals were a separate species we have dehumanised them seeing them as these brutish cave men Kennedy goes on But it seems like they were just as smart as us They could talk they created cave art They buried their dead and observed rituals To realise that Homo sapiens were migrating out of a tropical region and that they were carrying more microbes and that the Neanderthals further north struggled to deal with those its a neat reflection of the arguments about colonialism Children suffering from TB rest outdoors at Springwell House London in the 1930s The benefits of fresh air were then thought to combat the disease Photograph Fox PhotosGetty Images In the context of our own times Neanderthal man is particularly interesting to him We now know that Homo sapiens and Neanderthals interbred with the result that we carry their genes The Neanderthal genome has moreover been sequenced by Prof Svante Pbo the winner of the 2022 Nobel prize for physiology and papers published since have shown that Neanderthal gene variants in the contemporary population have had an impact on responses to Covid those carrying one such variant were 22 less likely to end up in intensive care compared with infected people of the same age Its crazy to think that something that happened 60000 years ago impacts on whether or not we have a really terrible reaction to Covid says Kennedy But if he is fascinated by the past hes also concerned about the future Were living in a golden age for microbes Population densities are increasing people are moving more quickly around the world the climate is changing Weve seen the emergence not just of Covid but of HIVAids Zika Dengue fever Sars and Ebola It seems now that we wont be able to conquer infectious diseases Rather were going to have to learn to deal with the new diseases that periodically arrive to threaten us If history teaches us anything he believes its that things will only change in terms of health if we stick together These are global societal issues If one rich country tries to save itself itll still be doomed Has writing Pathogenesis made him feel pessimistic On balance it hasnt While antibiotics may soon cease to be effective in treating some illnesses a prospect he finds frightening and hard to fathom in the future microbes may themselves provide the solution Viruses might be the new antibiotics They kill about half the bacteria in the world every day Its about finding the right one to target the right bacteria He thinks of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek the 17thcentury Delft haberdasher who pioneered the microscope No more pleasant sight has ever come before my eyes wrote Van Leeuwenhoek enraptured by the teeming new world he saw beneath his lens There is Kennedy says still so much to discover Were incredibly vulnerable as a species but were also incredibly ingenious A hundred and fifty years ago we didnt even know that microbes cause infectious diseases Now were analysing Neanderthal DNA This article was amended on 2 April 2023 to correct a mistranscription Dr Jonathan Kennedy spoke about the interbreeding of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals as something that happened 60000 years ago not 6000 years ago as an earlier version said

young man outside urinating against the glass front door The man was too drunk to notice Paul standing there so Paul had to wait in the lobby until the man had finished Living in an area surrounded by pubs and bars means dealing with public urination  and worse  is something he has grown used to It becomes normalised he says But that doesnt mean its right His family are from Soho and he says a lot of visitors arent aware there is a community who live there When people realise and are apologetic he doesnt mind so much  it feels thoughtless rather than disrespectful Its far worse he says when you get people who are just belligerent or rude Public toileting  or wild toileting as it has been called like an antisocial version of wild swimming  has been a growing concern particularly since Covid closed public loos many never to reopen That comes on top of a longerterm decline in public facilities  Raymond Martin managing director of the British Toilet Association estimates we have lost 50 of public toilets in the past 10 years Meanwhile cashstrapped councils streetcleaning budgets have been under pressure as costs of cleaning particularly during the pandemic have risen And according to a report by the Association for Public Service Excellence public satisfaction at cleaning is at its lowest in five years Martin had a meeting last year he says with the London assembly part of the Greater London Authority to try to get more public loos built or reopened Street urination is everywhere now he says because toilets were closed so people were being forced to go wherever they needed to go  alleyways street corners whatever Now youve got this smell and staining on the streets Thats just urination never mind the defecation side of things Its a major problem In recent years many politicians have called for a renewed focus on public toilets with limited success This year Labour London assembly members rejected an amendment tabled by the Green party that proposed spending 20m on new toilets at underground stations An increasingly rare sight  a functioning public toilet Photograph George ClerkGetty ImagesiStockphoto Perhaps we grew more accustomed to wild toileting during the pandemic  sales of Shewees for instance the device that allows women to stand while peeing and therefore pee where men pee have boomed 700 since the first lockdown  and it has taken us a while to return to normal standards It has always been a problem when large numbers of people descend on a place such as the visitors to Cheltenham races last month For 51 weeks of the year in Cheltenham no one would urinate against a wall in public at 1030 in the morning says Max Wilkinson a Cheltenham borough councillor During race week it seems to be something that happens and local people shouldnt be expected to turn a blind eye to it or accept it Its totally disgusting and it shows a lack of respect for our town Residents complain of men urinating in their front gardens and businesses report streams of urine in doorways and down walls It is a very small minority who do this but the impact on the local area is quite profound says Wilkinson People who are going for a wee in what they think is a quiet spot will get a bit of splashback on to their trousers and shoes This year Wilkinson declared as he calls it the War on Wee Public urination has always happened in the town during the races but he says its become more noticeable in recent years and thats despite the fact that more temporary loos have been put in One measure the council tried this year was hydrophobic waterrepellent paint on walls so when people go for a wee in what they think is a quiet spot or up against a wall somewhere in the town centre they will get a bit of splashback on to their trousers and shoes We did a social media campaign and there were posters all around town letting people know that its not acceptable Wilkinson says no fines were handed out in 2022 even though there were numerous complaints from residents and photographs posted on social media of men urinating on streets and in parks Making a dash for it  a race on Gold Cup day at Cheltenham last month Photograph Sam MellishGetty Images He has witnessed it himself I saw a group of blokes walking past the postal sorting office which isnt a long way from the town centre There were cars in stationary traffic less than 20 yards away they took one look at each other and decided to go for a wee against the wall This was in the morning Its disgusting and its got to stop Police said they were cautiously optimistic that antisocial behaviour had reduced in Cheltenham this year including complaints about public urination In Soho in central London residents have reported people peeing through their letterboxes says Tim Lord chair of the Soho Society On one of the worstaffected streets residents of one block reported that in the summer in particular people were urinating all along into the doorways of those flats on the ground floor Their kids saw mens genitals it was appalling The whole of Soho in the summer smells of urine and has done for three or four years Business rates of 200m are raised in the area he says much of that is from pubs and bars If youve got an area which is incredibly economically productive some of the money that generates should be spent to mitigate the problems its likely to cause  it always used to be and now isnt That seems to be fundamentally wrong Lord has lived in the area for more than 30 years For many years we had two quite large underground public toilets he says He lived near one of them It always used to be open from 10am till 2am and was quite well run quite clean About 10 or 15 years ago I noticed that they werent looking after it and it was closing earlier I thought that doesnt make sense Soho has a lot of alcohol licences about 400 in a quarter of a square mile Good public toilets he says are really an important part of Sohos ability to function Its not just the drinkers  many of whom will be tourists bringing money to the area  using them but market traders and homeless people Its another humiliation for the homeless people that theres nowhere they can go Both public toilets closed during the pandemic and didnt reopen though there are plans to refurbish one of them We now have very ugly temporary toilets which cost 15000 every weekend from Thursday says Lord The council have also introduced hydrophobic paint along with posters pleading with people not to urinate on the street There is an acknowledgement that theres a problem says Lord but then theyre still closing one of the large underground public toilets There appears to be no medium to longterm sensible plan The temporary toilets have decreased the level of public toileting he says but theyre pretty ugly We ask the council is that the plan for ever And theres no answer to that question Lord is sceptical about what he describes as the pee paint  would drunk people notice or care about their urine being splashed back on to them he wonders You could be fined under the Public Order Act if you are caught urinating in public or even punished for indecent exposure Other towns and cities have tried different measures Public openair GreenPee urinals that double as planters have been installed in Amsterdam and in Belgian cities In the GreenPee urinalcumplanter urine is absorbed by hemp  a single urinal can cope with up to 300 toilet visits It is taken away for composting and can later be used to fertilise public parks Paris home of the pissoir now has the Uritrottoir an eco urinal installed in areas of high public urination which also harvests urine for compost Lyon has considered women and trialled composting sitdown urinals not only did they save water compared with flushing toilets but the deputy mayor said that in the trial of 16 units 35000 litres of urine had been collected to use as fertiliser in less than three months And last year officials in Boston in the US decided to trial sensors in lifts on the transport system that would alert cleaning crews to the presence of urine In England and Wales the law is technically on the side of the War on Wee You could be fined under the Public Order Act if you are caught urinating in public or even punished for indecent exposure under the Sexual Offences Act of 2003 should you be found guilty of exposing your genitals and intending to cause alarm or distress In Scotland where public urination comes under the Civic Government Act police recorded 1222 urination offences in 2021 Nowhere to go  derelict public toilets in north London Photograph Gary Colet PhotographyGetty Images But unless a police officer happens to be passing the vast majority of public urination instances are not reported Max Wilkinson points out that he reviews social media for complaints from local residents because thats now a popular way for people to report it Social media users have even shared video doorbell footage of people urinating in front gardens in a bid to publicly shame individuals Some have complained to parcel or food delivery companies that their employees have been caught urinating on their property though this is more likely because of a lack of proper breaks and access to facilities rather than disrespect or lax hygiene Apart from being unpleasant wild toileting comes with more serious implications As Wilkinson says witnessing someone relieving themselves in public can feel threatening to a lot of women and to men too Urine can erode buildings and create pollution While the ecological impact of public toileting in towns and cities remains understudied its reasonable to believe it may have a detrimental effect on nearby waterways Dr Christian Dunn senior lecturer in natural sciences at Bangor University led a study to measure the presence of drugs in the nearby river during and after Glastonbury festival and found cocaine levels high enough to potentially harm wildlife downstream  contamination caused by public toileting The problem with chemicals in urine entering our rivers is that they help create a cocktail of drugs in our waters  and we have very little knowledge of what the effects of this everchanging mix are on aquatic wildlife ecosystems and ultimately our own health Dunn says We can research the effects of one particular chemical such as cocaine on one species like eels but the situation in our rivers is much more complex  there are many chemicals and compounds reacting with entire ecosystems with short and potentially longterm effects Wetlands he says can help mitigate these risks Existing between rivers and land they act as ecological kidneys says Dunn and could help filter out harmful chemicals but these have been decimated over the centuries as weve strived to use every bit of land in the UK for building or farming We should be looking to reestablish these wetlands along all our rivers  in the countryside and even our cities And then there are hygiene issues The pandemic reminded us of the importance of cleanliness says Martin of the British Toilet Association but we are not creating the infrastructure to support it Weve got to get our hygiene levels back up to not only where they were but way beyond that That means things like flushing toilets rather than urinating in the street and people being able to wash their hands Epidemics fuelled the rise of public toilets in the first place says Lee Jackson historian and author of Dirty Old London The Victorian Fight Against Filth The Victorians were the first people to try to deal with public urination They did that off the back of the cholera epidemics of 1832 and 1848 where anything that seemed insanitary had the worry that it brought contagious disease he says Measures such as commit no nuisance signs builtin deflectors on temptingly discreet walls of buildings and castiron urinals  many incredibly ornate  started to appear on streets few of the urinals survive in London but Jackson says Birmingham is a good place to spot them Public toilets for women didnt really come in until the late 1880s says Jackson Conveniences were part of that late Victorian thing of municipal socialism  public libraries baths and toilets  this idea that we have these things built for regular people he says Sadly and maddeningly for anyone caught short that lovely idea now feels as quaint and fanciful as an ornate urinal

cutting The cost of looking after your hair can add up to hundreds of pounds a year with prices for women averaging about 50 for a cut 35 for a blowdry and more than 80 for highlights,Switch hairdresser The cost of looking after your hair can add up to hundreds of pounds a year with prices for women averaging about 50 for a cut 35 for a blowdry and more than 80 for highligh 5850 chars,Switch hairdresser The cost of looking after your hair can add up to hundreds of pounds a year with prices for women averaging about 50 for a cut 35 for a blowdry and more than 80 for highlights according to recent figures from the Hair and Beauty Industry Authority Habia But like any service you can shop around for the best deal There are thousands of hairdressers to choose from and a small local salon may offer a much cheaper rate than a chain Compare prices and ask for cheaper recommendations in your neighbourhood on sites such as Nextdoor and your local Facebook and WhatsApp groups Many hairdressers also offer new customers money off their first cut  perhaps 25  so you can try out different salons and get a discount Meanwhile during the current cost of living crisis some hairdressers have been offering pay what you can afford and even free haircuts to struggling customers Downgrade your stylist Ask for a junior as they are usually a much cheaper option than a senior stylist with years of experience The difference in price can be hundreds of pounds depending on what you have done These stylists are fully trained and usually eager to do a good job and more experienced hairdressers will typically check that they dont make any big mistakes Joan Scott chief executive of Habia says Look at the treatment and service menu and see if theres a more affordable option If youre not sure ask your salon what options are available within your budget Be flexible If you are able to get your hair done on weekday for example or on a particular evening you may save a small fortune Hairdressers often run discount days or offer cheaper prices during quieter times such as midmorning When you are making an appointment ask when their cheaper times are and what they suggest for the best deal If you are really flexible leave it to the last minute and a hairdresser may be able to offer a hefty discount for a vacant appointment Discounts and cashback Search Groupon for salons offering discounts Go to the website enter your area and search for the service you are after There are usually lots of deals on offer This week when we looked a deal on Groupon offered balayage a hair colouring technique with a wash cut and blowdry for 39 instead of 125 at a central London salon You could also try Wowcher which works in a similar way and was this week offering deals such as savings of up to 79 on a keratin hair treatment Cashback sites such as TopCashback are a goto when it comes to hair products offering money back on wellknown brands such as Sephora Boots and Superdrug As with any product compare prices in discount stores supermarkets and pharmacies to make sure you get the lowest price Be a model Search for salons that need models for their trainee hairdressers An experienced stylist will be present for the process to avoid any disastrous mistakes For example Toni  Guy often wants volunteers at its London and Manchester salons to get a cheap cut from its supervised academy students You could get your hair cut from as little as 10 in a top salon this way You can sign up to be a cut and colour model at the Vidal Sassoon teaching academy in London but be aware that you are asked to leave a minimum of three hours for the appointment When we looked the London Hairdressing Academy was offering a range of discounted services such as a wash cut and finish for 11 or 35 for a full head of highlights if you are booking with one of its students However perhaps not surprisingly in the current cost of living crisis the model slots often get booked up quickly You may also find that your area has a local beauty college that offers cheap cuts Loyalty schemes Some salons such as Headmasters run loyalty schemes and plenty are offering discounts to help customers during the cost of living crisis You can sign up online and get a Headmasters card offering 25 off all services from Monday to Friday 9am4pm and 10 at other times It also has a referafriend scheme offering 40 off a cut and style for you and your friend If you are already a regular at a particular salon check you are signed up to any loyalty scheme it offers There may be other discounts too such as complimentary blowdry appointments to try the service before you book Do it yourself You may have already tried cutting or colouring your hair at home during the pandemic lockdowns when hairdressers shut up shop If you did you will probably have discovered its not as easy as it looks However if you want to give it a go there are plenty of videos online such as this one that guide you through the haircutting process You can order professional hairdressing scissors online which are specially angled for a sharper cut Also if you spend a lot on hair products or pay for conditioning treatments at the salon get creative and make your own You can make an effective hair mask out of egg avocado and olive oil Search online for inspiration A mobile hairdresser Plenty of selfemployed hairdressers have set up a mobile service or work in their own homes for a fraction of salon prices As they dont have to pay salon overheads they are usually substantially cheaper They can also be useful if you struggle to find time to go the hairdresser and want a more convenient and relaxing experience Many offer appointments outside salon hours too such as on Sundays or after 6pm Search for your local mobile hairdresser at Your Local Hairdresser Watch out for extras Hairdressers often try to sell you styling products or special conditioning treatments when you are at the salon But these typically add a lot to your bill so make sure to opt out if you are asked and doublecheck that you are not being charged for extras at the till You could also ditch your regular extras to cut costs If you usually have a blowdry for example go without Go for a damp cut and dry your hair at home

election making Bolsonaro the first incumbent to fail to be reelected in Brazil since redemocratisation A week after Lulas inauguration Brazils congress presidential palace and supreme court were invaded by thousands of supporters of Bolsonaro They proceeded to smash the windows artworks and computers of the buildings that symbolise Brazilian democracy I mention this not because the invasion of Braslia made me happy it did not or because Lulas election made me happy it did but because Lulas campaign slogan was sem medo de ser feliz which translates literally as without fear of being happy or put more succinctly unafraid of happiness In his first speech as president Lula began by promising every Brazilian three meals a day a job and access to healthcare and education He went on to promise zero deforestation indigenous land rights and the recreation of the ministries for racial equality women and culture Lulas slogan acknowledges something we can be loth to admit That happiness  this supposedly intangible romantic thing  is directly linked to the most quantifiable and decidedly unethereal aspects of lives our material conditions It may be an obvious thing to say but it is our material conditions that determine how long and how hard our lives are what we can do with them and where Sem medo de ser feliz argues for better material conditions not simply for their own sake  or for the sake of increased productivity or fairness  but for the sake of happiness It was not a given that things would be this way My Brazilian mother and British father married in London in 1988 the year Brazil passed a new constitution after two decades of military dictatorship I was born in 1992 and grew up surrounded by postcold war political optimism one of the earliest things I can remember is my reception teachers celebrating Labours victory in 1997 Until the financial crash of 2008 the defining mood of my childhood and adolescence was that things could only get better However as an adult the material conditions experienced by my generation are worse than those experienced by our parents at our age Most of us rent at a time when rented housing has become harder to secure bidding wars and payments of a years rent upfront are now commonplace in London and of increasingly low quality the Times reports that only 10 of flatshares in London have a communal area Inflation is increasing and wages are not and in many sectors pensions are also being slashed Childcare provision is collapsing and the climate crisis only worsens When I think of myself and my friends it is obvious that our happiness is determined by our material conditions One friend cant live on the same continent as his longterm partner because he doesnt earn enough to sponsor her visa Another puts off having a baby because its too expensive Another has been evicted for the second time in a year because their landlord has decided to sell Others spend the working day in discomfort because they cant afford to heat their homes These kinds of stories are not exclusive to young people theyll be familiar to people of all ages especially people with dependants people who do not own their own homes and do not have family wealth In terms of happiness the effect is both daytoday deprivation and something qualitatively different more prolonged We are less free Lulas victory has made me feel freedom is possible His strategy was to build a broad coalition of Black Indigenous gay bisexual transgender and workingclass Brazilians He did this by promising to improve the material conditions of all these groups The logic here was the opposite of austeritystyle scarcity which pits one marginalised group against another whether thats trans and cis women or workingclass people from migrant and nonmigrant backgrounds The logic of Lulas broad coalition is that if the most vulnerable in society are better off everyone else will be better off too It asks Brazilians to dream of freedom for each other  happiness for all  instead of fighting each other for scraps Happiness then to me is first and foremost a case of material conditions  of good warm housing education healthcare and a job Because having these material needs met means freedom to live well and as you wish The way I see it sem medo de ser feliz means being unafraid of the happiness of others too It means letting go of the fear that if the material conditions of another group of people improve that the group I belong to will suffer To me being unafraid of happiness means believing in freedom for us all

that just before the second national lockdown began those born in Britain in 1958 and 1970 were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress on average than they had ever experienced in adulthood before surpassing previous peaks in their early 40s Data collected over four decades from more than 16000 Britishborn adults which was analysed by academics from University College London and Kings College London also found that those born in 1946 had similar levels of psychological distress to their previous midlife peak in their early 50s This peak of anxiety during the first year of the pandemic was higher for women than men across all age groups widening the already substantial gender inequalities in mental health that existed before the pandemic Most of the studies we analysed propose that this is due to a totally different share of the domestic and caring responsibilities during lockdown said Dr Dario MorenoAgostino lead author of the report An increase in genderbased violence and abuse as well as additional financial constraints are also suggested because theres evidence showing that women were in more precarious situations than men for instance from the work point of view more care workers  typically women  were exposed to more difficulties than other professions he added This unforeseen second midlife mental health crisis may accelerate and exacerbate the onset and occurrence of chronic mental health and health difficulties increasing pressures on the NHS the study suggests There is the question of resilience but we know that anxiety and depression are the top leading causes of disease worldwide said MorenoAgostino Those mental health problems are closely linked to numerous physical health problems  right up to and including increased morbidity The fact that we are observing an unexpected new peak of the very mental health problems that can lead to these longterm trajectories is deeply concerning he added The study contradicts a recent study by McGill University researchers in Canada which found Covid19 may not have taken as great a toll on the mental health of most people as earlier research indicated That research based on a review of 137 studies from around the world said some of the public narrative around the mental health impacts of Covid19 were based on poorquality studies and anecdotes which became selffulfilling prophecies adding that there was a need for more rigorous science Along with other experts MorenoAgostino disputed these findings He warned that McGills worldwide approach could not accurately assess the impact

women had experienced worsening anxiety depression or general mental health symptoms during the pandemic That study also pointed to causes including juggling more family responsibilities careers in health or social care and domestic abuse Other robust studies have reached different conclusions to the McGill paper suggesting that the mental health impact of the pandemic has been severe In 2021 researchers at the University of Queensland found that anxiety and depression around the world had increased dramatically in 2020 In April 2021 the Royal College of Psychiatrists observed a sharp rise in mental ill health In February 2022 NHS leaders warned of a second pandemic of depression anxiety psychosis and eating disorders But Prof Peter Tyrer emeritus professor in community psychiatry at Imperial College London stressed that the McGill work was of good quality and reflects much of what we now know He agreed with the researchers conclusion that the pandemic had a similar positive effect on resilience to wars because social cohesion despite the handicaps of lockdown and social distancing improves when there is a common enemy

if only because they succeeded in getting the basics right Eddie Howes impressive side did not even have to work hard for their goals and as the match drew to a close it was hard to know what more West Ham need to see before accepting that David Moyess time is up Out of the bottom three on goal difference West Ham have ignored the obvious for too long and are paying for their failure to act This was a humiliation for Moyes The Scot watched helplessly as his side were given a lesson in focus by opponents cantering towards the Champions League after their fourth consecutive win He listened grimly as the last few home fans left in the stadium applauded when Newcastles crowing supporters taunted Moyes with chants of Youre getting sacked in the morning The travelling Toon Army had a point and the atmosphere turned toxic Moyes was booed off after a rotten defensive display from West Ham and the onus is on the coowner David Sullivan to act There can be no excuses Everything was too easy for Newcastle as they exposed Moyess dreadful fullbacks Thilo Kehrer and Emerson Palmieri and accepted the gifts from West Hams centrebacks Kurt Zouma and Nayef Aguerd whose shocking performance was summed up by the moment when he killed off any chance of a comeback by handing Callum Wilson his second goal of the evening 22 seconds into the second half It was Wilson who had got the ball rolling in the sixth minute punishing slack marking after Sad Benrahma neglected his defensive duties and gave Allan SaintMaximin too much time to cross There was a vast difference in application between the sides Newcastle were jaded after their win over Manchester United and Howe was not happy with their level during a pulsating first half but their resilience meant they tightened their grip on third place I dont think we were perfect Howe said West Ham made it a good game But we took our chances When you reflect back to Sunday the emotion that took out of us we looked a little fatigued We were great in elements of our game Mentally we got through it and got a massive result Every positive result strengthens our position Nothing is going to be decided short term The same applies at the opposite end of the table West Ham had glimpsed a chance to climb but they cannot relax after their first home defeat since December Their away form is dreadful and they still have to host Arsenal United and Liverpool They could do with a result at Fulham on Saturday Joelinton fires home in the 90th minute of the game to seal a 51 win for Newcastle Photograph John WaltonPA At least the early signs had been encouraging for West Ham They were direct when they attacked and could have led when Jarrod Bowen tore down the right inside the first minute held off Dan Burn and produced a cutback so inviting it almost made Bruno Guimares turn the ball into his own net Guimares was relieved to see the ball bounce off a post then for Declan Rice to hammer a shot over West Hams wounds were selfinflicted There were groans when Kehrer misjudged a long ball and conceded a needless corner in the sixth minute West Hams concentration faded The corner was cleared as far as SaintMaximin who

stepped out of from the back and played a ball straight through the middle Played onside by Emerson Joelinton rounded Fabianski and made it 20 Still though Newcastle were not entirely secure at the back West Ham responded Michail Antonio and Lucas Paqueta both going close Fabianski stopped Wilson and West Ham took note of Nick Pope receiving treatment Antonio stopped Newcastles goalkeeper coming for Bowens corner in the 39th minute and Zoumas header dragged West Ham back into it West Ham were energised by the goal albeit a little fortunate not to lose Emerson for a foul on Jacob Murphy They were still too erratic West Ham were not equipped to deal with Newcastles aggression The third goal summed it up Aguerd received a pass from Fabianski dithered and lost possession to Murphy who presented Wilson with an open goal Out of the window went Moyess halftime instructions Newcastle looked for more Murphy and SaintMaximin testing Fabianski West Hams shape was gone Fabianski miscontrolled Guimaress ball and Isak lobbed in the fourth The home sections emptied out Those who stayed could at least appreciate Joelintons fine finish for Newcastles fifth in added time

uncovers the scale of the crisis in a system where the most vulnerable will continue to be put at risk I felt abandoned trauma of being uprooted and taken into careSome of Britains most vulnerable children are being moved to care,Some of Britains most vulnerable children are being moved to care homes more than 300 miles away from the neighbourhoods they grew up in according to an Observer investigation revealing a national s 6607 chars,Some of Britains most vulnerable children are being moved to care homes more than 300 miles away from the neighbourhoods they grew up in according to an Observer investigation revealing a national scandal The shocking figures make clear for the first time the scale of the crisis that has long worried child welfare experts They show dozens of children from London alone are in foster or care homes more than 250 miles from the city as councils battle a significant shortfall in provision Children from the capital have been placed in homes near Perth Glasgow Knowsley Leeds and Carlisle Care experts said that the pattern is being repeated across the country removing children from critical support networks and familiar surroundings About 600 children from London are in foster or residential care more than 50 miles from their home neighbourhoods Councils have warned they often have to compete for limited places and face rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children Some children need to be placed in certain locations for their own safety However there is widespread acceptance that the care system is failing to provide enough appropriate places in the right areas Experts warn that relocating children removed them from schools friends and extended family as well as clubs and activities that were often key to their wellbeing They warned it also put some at greater risk of exploitation According to the Observers findings uncovered using the Freedom of Information Act at least 37 children from the capital are placed more than 250 miles away The figure is likely to be far higher as some councils did not reveal precise numbers At least 600 are more than 50 miles away John Pearce from the Association of Directors of Childrens Services said the investigation highlighted a pressing and longstanding national issue that we continue to raise with the government  a lack of local placements for the children in our care Local authorities are working hard to overcome the sufficiency challenges they face he said But we need the support of the government to address the significant challenges we all face as well as rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children Clare Bracey director of policy and campaigns at Become a charity for care leavers and those still in care said being moved far from home left children lonely and isolated This is a national scandal and is getting worse she said There are sometimes reasons why these moves are necessary for the child but the reality is that for many children these moves are happening because there just are not enough suitable places for them to stay close to home They are being let down Chris Wild a care leaver who campaigns for more legal protections for care leavers said he knew of cases of children being moved several times a year I was in the care system 30 years ago but from everything Im seeing nothing has changed he said Theres evidence these moves put them at greater risk of going missing ending up homeless or developing severe mental health issues An independent review of childrens social care last year revealed a system spiralling out of control recommending a fiveyear 26bn plan to improve it However ministers initially pledged just 200m over two years The government has since said it has added 259m to fund homes Anne Longfield the former childrens commissioner for England said the large distances involved were a symptom of a broken system I have heard so many horrific stories of teenagers who are moved far from home to places where they know nobody she said They then become easy pickings for those who want to exploit and abuse children The independent review of childrens social care published a year ago provided a roadmap to fixing this crisis However the governments halfhearted response and its failure to provide the levels of investment required means hundreds of vulnerable children will continue to be put at risk in places they cant even place on a map Rachel de Souza Englands current childrens commissioner said she wanted to see particular attention paid to sibling groups those with mental health needs or disabilities or who live in custody for whom being placed large distances from their families and support networks can leave them without any of the positive relationships in their lives that other children take for granted skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they

placements with some of the young people needing to be moved for their own safety They said keeping all children within their neighbourhoods was always the aim and that the vast majority of children were placed within their boroughs There are also several studies and plans under way to create more secure child care home places However many acknowledged the serious shortcomings hampering the system There is a crisis in the residential care home sector where a scarcity of places means that it can be extremely hard to find a suitable home for children  especially if they have complex or specific needs said Anntoinette Bramble deputy mayor of Hackney A Greenwich borough council spokesperson said that a lack of sufficient placement options is a national issue for children in care Marian James from Sutton council said The independent review of childrens care recommended more funding for childrens social care which we wholeheartedly agree with along with reform of the childrens care system but we need to receive adequate funding to enable the whole of the review recommendations to be fully realised A Department for Education spokesperson said Local authorities are responsible for placing looked after children and must look to make placements in the childs best interests which in most cases means a child is placed within 20 miles of their home In addition to the 200m announced in March we are investing 259m to create more placements for children in highquality and safe homes We are also investing over 27m to recruit and retain more foster carers and are working to develop a new regional model of delivering care placements helping more children stay closer to their home networks

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/lead-litter-picking-group-defend-litterers,I lead a litterpicking group but I will always defend litterers This is why  Leila Taheri,If any anger

flotilla of plastic shores made up  5276 chars,Rubbish seems to be everywhere you look As one of the leaders of a community wetlands group in northwest London Ive witnessed a cormorant diving into a bobbing flotilla of plastic shores made up of plastic and a heron starving to death due to red nylon tangled around its beak Last month a new disease caused solely by plastics was discovered in seabirds And in February our group Friends of the Welsh Harp removed four tonnes of rubbish from a river and the surrounding woodland Our rivers are not only open sewers theyre also open dustbins that lead to the sea Youd think based on this that Id feel angry at those who litter  that Id resent them But I dont And I believe you should resist that temptation too Let me explain why I investigated why people litter as part of a psychoanalytic studies MA and found that on an individual level littering is a kind of revenge on society  its a litmus test of how people are feeling And judging by what I see on a daily basis many people are feeling alienated disconnected and excluded They are angry and are taking it out on the world Is that any surprise when local communities are broken or nonexistent their deep local knowledge lost and connection to nature severed In a time of polycrisis climate breakdown cost of living crisis assaults on democracy threats to the NHS negative feelings about the world and yourself have got to go somewhere Nature  exposed unprotected wild and often neglected  is a perfect place to dump those rubbish feelings whether thats doing it physically with litter or going on a walk to destress The impulse to litter comes from a feeling that we cannot really affect the world negatively or positively  after all what impact can one individual have compared with a polluting company let alone a whole polluting country It comes from a lack of belief in the power of the individual to effect change which in itself is rooted in feelings of despair and hopelessness Such feelings are understandable when the scale of the environmental crisis is as staggering as it is now Volunteers clear litter off the beach and foreshore at Aberystwyth Wales Photograph aberCPCAlamy When we assume the moral fault lies only with the litterers we let those creating the systemic problems off the hook After all littering exposes our economic model for what it is profitdriven unaccountable and amoral Littering is fuelled by manufacturers that continue to push hard to generate waste for profit In the 1950s a speaker at a plastics conference announced to delegates that your future is in the garbage wagon The public were actually taught by these profiteers to throw things away so they keep making and selling Fast forward to today and plastic production is set to triple by 2060 If we really want things to change if we want our green and blue spaces back we need real legislative change on plastic packaging Yet as local authorities and government agencies become even more cashstrapped its convenient for them to ignore all this and blame the individuals who litter and flytip then leave the cleanup to volunteer groups like ours It suits them too to minimise the problem the Canal and River Trust CRT which has guardianship of all of Britains waterways including the Welsh Harp played down the plastic pollution crisis by describing it as unsightly rubbish Natural England the governments adviser for the environment supports our litterpicking efforts to improve the aesthetic of these areas What can be done Shaming and denouncing litterers attitudes does not work It leads to stubborn refusal and entrenches litterers more deeply in their position reinforcing their negative behaviours Rather than a blaming moralistic attitude towards them we might do better adopting a more thoughtful and understanding stance Hello how are you is a much better starting point than Dont be a tosser If any anger is justified it should be directed at profiteering manufacturers and our throwaway culture We must help people overcome the ecological alienation that ultimately leads them to mistreat their environment Overcoming this alienation means forming attachments which means caring To be caring we need to feel cared for Our local authorities government and environmental groups need to be open and honest and show that they understand and care They should face reality recognise the staggering scale of issues and apologise for past neglect An open honest society mourns the fact that the earth cant endlessly give  that it has limitations It recognises that it must engage in actual practical care of humans wildlife and plant life through thoughtful action and collaboration It must support volunteer groups such as ours that are doing meaningful ecocare work like many other caring professions our work is undervalued As individuals when we reconnect with nature and enjoy whatever green and blue spaces we have locally preferably with others love soon blossoms As with human relationships you soon find yourself caring and even feeling responsible You find yourself heartbroken when something bad happens You fight for these places and know you just cant live without them And if you can get some bureaucratic organisation to feel the same way too Ill buy you a drink

presence of the Stormers and Sharks in the last eight at the first attempt is a positive for South African rugby there really should be an additional box in the corner of the TV screen displaying their latest air miles tally Take the Stormers This calendar year alone they have played away in Glasgow London Belfast and Dublin Now having seen off Harlequins in hot humid conditions in Cape Town last Saturday they are having to pack their bags again and head north to face Exeter this Saturday Faced with a similar schedule even Tom Cruises Maverick would be begging for more downtime in the Top Gun hangar A further complication is the looming Easter holiday weekend Not only did Stormers not know exactly where they would be playing until Sunday afternoon but positioning the last 16 and the quarterfinals together with millions of holidaymakers also on the move is making life impractical for European supporters too Even if they have the spare time prices are skyhigh and the hoopjumping is too complicated to make following their team practicable It adds up to a scenario that someone somewhere should have spotted in advance Next year thankfully there will be no Easter clash but the round of 16 and quarterfinals will once more be wedged in alongside each other Why A tournament that was once proudly away fancentric is in danger of becoming one that only really works for broadcasters and travel agents This is both a crying shame and another sign of the times Rugby is changing and the product has to be as tiptop as possible In that respect the South African sides are unquestionably adding extra quality and keeping the rest of the field on their toes Last season the furthest Quins had to travel in this competition was to the south of France Now they have visited both Durban and Cape Town and finished second best both times No visiting side in fact has won in eight attempts on South African soil this season The acid test of southern quality though is about to arrive The Sharks might have stuck 50 points on Munster at home last Satuday but beating Toulouse in Toulouse will require them to ascend to a whole different level Not without good reason did all eight last16 ties end up with the home side progressing compared with only four when the suddendeath format was introduced two seasons ago Exeter are the perfect case study They may not currently be the greatest club side in the world but in their own backyard in front of their own supporters they can supply a culture clash to disconcert anyone let alone slightly dusty longhaul travellers If ever there was a week to lower ticket prices and to pack out Sandy Park with noisy Devonians this is it particularly if one or two Stormers turn up slightly unsure which hemisphere they are in La Rochelles Grgory Alldritt drives at the Gloucester defence during the French sides hardfought victory Photograph Thibaud MoritzAFPGetty Images Hence why any win on the road in the later stages of the Champions Cup is to be savoured As the two South African sides have already discovered the immutable law is that pool standings hugely affect what happens subsequently Leinster and La Rochelle are unbeaten in this seasons competition and are perhaps the last venues in Europe where opponents would fancy heading While that makes Gloucesters heroic stand on the Atlantic coast on Saturday all the more praiseworthy they may just have prodded the La Rochelle beast As the England prop Mako Vunipola has intimated this coming Sundays visitors Saracens anticipate a sharply improved home performance from the off when they travel to the Stade MarcelDeflandre When it comes down to the crunch how many Leicester fans would put their mortgages on their team faring massively better than England did in the Aviva Stadium

handicap their countrys economic and political realities and the funding disparity with some of their northern rivals It is less a question of South African players raising the standard in Europe this season as finally being able to do so in their own provincial uniforms

offer lotterylike wins  houses cars and cash prizes  have taken off recently Is their success connected to the costofliving crisisIf someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of ho,If someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of house that would cause Kevin McCloud to collapse into a puddle of adjectives and help raise mil 12846 chars,If someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of house that would cause Kevin McCloud to collapse into a puddle of adjectives and help raise millions of pounds for charity you would probably ask what the catch was But that improbable offering is Omazes core business Since launching in the UK in April 2020 the organisation has been running prize draws in which for a relatively small amount of money you can be in with the chance to win a multimillionpound dream house When the draw ends a chosen charity partner gets the lions share of the profits The exact odds of winning are unclear  Omaze doesnt publish precise figures and the odds get worse as more people enter  but people do win big and that has kept me interested enough to enter every competition since it first popped up on my Instagram feed While I have only won a 10 Amazon voucher it hasnt stopped me dreaming about what my life would be like if my ticket was drawn  Id probably rent out the house as a luxurious holiday home giving family and close friends free usage offpeak weekends only  Im not made of money before eventually selling it The popularity of these draws  each receives hundreds of thousands if not millions of entries and its still growing  tells us a few things about the UK Namely that as a nation we love escapism and the thought of a big win transforming our lives look to the tradition of doing the pools having a flutter on the Grand National and getting a ticket for the national lottery From another angle it illustrates the sheer ridiculousness of the housing market where the greatest prize we can comprehend is a roof over our head albeit a fancy one It is certainly why as I approach my 25th year as a renter I have been so committed to entering these giveaways There is very little chance of me winning but while the cost of living crisis continues interest rates push 5 and inflation remains double that there is little chance of me being able to afford to buy a house in London either The average property price based on sales in the capital last year was just over 730000 according to Zoopla Alternatively renting has cost me the best part of 150000 since I moved to London in 2006 Who wouldnt dream of a golden ticket out of that scenario Im far from the only person daydreaming in this way I want to help my granddaughters get on the property ladder says one Omaze Trustpilot reviewer People like me cant afford to get on the property ladder This is maybe my only opportunity to own my own house says another Until recently Kevin Johnson a 34yearold carpenter from north London was also prone to daydreaming about life as the owner of a luxury home But he no longer has to wonder  he has just won a 3m house in an Omaze prize draw Johnson and his wife Dee along with their four kids will soon be moving into a beautiful fourbed Victorian semi just 15 minutes from where they now rent a threebed flat As part of the prize as well as any fees and stamp duty being covered they have also won 100000 to help them settle in I dont think its ever going to sink in to be honest says Dee Johnson has been entering the dreamhouse competition for about two years and never really thought he would win but was happy to be giving money to charity More recently he says he had been practising a more positive approach going as far as cutting out a photograph of the London house from an Omaze newspaper advertisement and showing it to his youngest telling him it is where the family would be moving to The parking permit for my van is running out at our current address so I said I wasnt going to replace it until the house had been drawn because I had a feeling I was going to win he says On the day of the draw Johnson received a call from the Omaze team telling him he had won something but not exactly what and that they were on their way to his house He immediately called his wife who works in childcare and education parttime and in healthcare at a hospital She was sceptical As no one was in they went to the pub around the corner to wait for Kevin to get home I thought Who does that It definitely sounded like a scam But Johnson recognised the Omaze presenters voice from the TV adverts and he and the children were soon greeted by the team complete with a mock key to hand over and a camera and lighting crew ready to film a reaction video Johnson later called Dee to tell her the news On her way home from work on a packed train she took the video call but couldnt find her headphones to take it in private He was using this voice Id never heard before he was shaking she says The whole carriage heard what had happened and they all cheered and applauded she says I got off at my stop but sat on the platform for 20 minutes to take it in Apart from looking forward to having more space the couple who have been married for almost 13 years say that very little about their daytoday lives will change  they will be staying in their jobs which they love and as the new house is so close to their old one their children can still go to the same schools In the short term aside from starting their mortgagefree lives Johnson is excited about kitting out the annexe in the garden  a big TV and a sofa nothing crowded he says  but the longer term is packed with freedom and opportunity We have dreams and desires about setting up our own business so we have flexibility with that because of this win says Dee And the children definitely have more security too Its a big win for them Seeing the children living in a house like that  I cant put that into words says Johnson Omazes prize house in Cornwall Photograph Omaze What winners do with the houses which have been all over the UK from the Lake District and the Cotswolds to Kent and  the current prize  Cornwall is entirely up to them It is roughly a threeway split between those who move in to the new house those who sell it and those who rent it out according to James Oakes Omazes chief international officer who is based in the UK Winners have just 96 hours to claim their winnings and agree to the terms and conditions If they dont respond in that time they forfeit the prize which actually happened to one cashprize winner Omaze started life in the US in 2012 founded by Ryan Cummins and Matthew Pohlson two graduates of Stanford University Believing the traditional charity fundraising model to be broken they founded Omaze after attending a charity auction in which they witnessed very wealthy people bid upwards of 15000 to sit alongside Magic Johnson at an LA Lakers game What if they thought they could organise a prize draw with a much lower price to attract a greater number of entrants It took off with moneycantbuy experiences as the main attraction  Omazes Star Wars prize offering the chance to be in Episode VII The Force Awakens raised more than 4m for Unicef and received entries from all over the world It wasnt without criticism with some in the charity world expressing concern over the strategies while a classaction suit was filed in the US in April 2021 alleging Omaze had violated various California laws This was mostly dismissed by a judge in February 2022 and appeared to centre on an argument over whether or not the draw was a legal lottery Perhaps its unrelated but from January this year Omaze has paused its future US operations Omazes UK launch just as the pandemic was kicking off in 2020 was met with similar cynicism which according to Oakes has been a big hurdle for the company Anecdotally about half the friends and colleagues I told about writing this piece had assumed the draws were somehow illegitimate The other half enter each one James Oakes Omazes chief international officer When you buy from Omaze you are not buying a tangible product but you have to trust that we have registered your entry that the draw is taking place fairly that the money really is going to the charity and you will really get the house if you win says Oakes So theres a real premium on doing things properly and establishing trust which is why we have registered with the regulator and abide by the fundraising code of practice It wasnt just the public he had to convince The first draw was for a house in Cheshire worth about 1m The brief was clear  Omaze bought the house would recoup the money from ticket sales and once the books were balanced would give 80 of any profit to a chosen charity partner the company has yet to make a profit itself despite taking 20 of net proceeds It just needed a charity but with reputation at stake none were interested The reticence was understandable We hear from lots of different types of startups with great ideas says Paul Glazier head of corporate partnerships at Alzheimers Research UK Id say 99 of them dont come off or we just cant partner with them We went down on our hands and knees and begged a charity to work with us on that first one says Oakes Teenage Cancer Trust was the first to say yes It received 250000 on the back of the first draw and jumped at the chance to work with Omaze for a second time on a house in Marbella last year Since launching in the UK Omaze has given more than 11m to some of the UKs biggest charities including the British Heart Foundation the NSPCC Great Ormond Street hospital Dogs Trust and after Glazier and his colleagues had done their due diligence Alzheimers Research UK There is now a bidding process in which charities pitch their case We got 1m from the draw for the Lake District house says Lucy Squance director of supporterled fundraising at Alzheimers Research UK For a charity of our size to get that sort of figure is completely transformational And it wasnt just the money We were on primetime TV adverts for two or three months over Christmas We just dont have that kind of advertising power and as a result gained more than 1500 direct supporters and were able to engage with the public in a way we would never be able to otherwise It was worth so much more than the 1m Now established Oakes says the hardest thing is finding suitable houses to give away Its absolute murder Were now buying houses six or seven competitions in advance We used to take houses that were already pristine but as were now able to prepare more we are looking at houses where renovation is required and we can tailor them Who knows in the future we could end up building them If Omaze and houses arent your thing there are alternatives BOTB has been running since 2000 If you have ever seen a supercar in an airport or a shopping centre with someone selling tickets to win it theres a very high chance it was BOTB Since early 2020 it has been an onlineonly business in which you can win anything from a Mini to a Lamborghini depending on which price ticket you buy they start at 30p We have all sorts of people enter says Rupert Garton the companys commercial director Theyre not gamblers but carloving people who want to have a go Weve had people for whom winning a car is a very nice thing to people whose lives will be completely changed for ever Winners can also choose a cash alternative  80 of the cars value  and about half do just that Aspire Competitions is another company offering luxury prizes for a relatively small cost Since launching in March 2020 it has become synonymous with giving away VW campervans but also TVs consoles motorbikes and vintage scooters camping equipment powertool bundles and expensive grooming products It buys all the prizes up front sells a limited number of tickets and guarantees there will be a winner even if there are still tickets remaining There has been a slight dip in entries since Novembers disaster budget says James Ovenden founder and director of Aspire but things remain steady I think its about giving people a bit of hope We have lowered our ticket prices accordingly but increased numbers so your money will go further without significantly lowering the odds While our interest in winning things lays bare the housing crisis the Johnsons London home also demonstrates the imbalance of the countrys property market Win a 3m house in the Lake District as Catherine Carwardine of Telford did in April 2022 and you get a sixbedroomed palace complete with a cinema room sauna steam room gym multiple gardens and a workshop Win a similarly valued property in London and you get a semidetached house in which your kids might still have to share a bedroom For now Im going to adopt Johnsons positive mental attitude and imagine my life in a luxury home of my own He and Dee also said they would invite me to their housewarming A quiet gathering  we dont want to upset our new neighbours says Dee And youll have to take your shoes off at the door

war and based on Georges Rodenbachs short novel BrugeslaMorte 1892 the work is often spoken of as a study of grief Grief we might argue is more nuanced an ebb and flow The dominant force here

something I cant seem to get over It makes my every nerve seize up and I end up holding my breath I wont make a fuss about it but I dont like holding ketchup bottles or holding plates with leftover ketchup on them When I was younger this aversion extended to mayo barbecue sauce and other condiments but I am happy to eat most of those now I have a vague memory of someone smushing a sandwich with ketchup into my face as a child and the feeling of it being around my mouth and cheeks While Ive occasionally eaten some accidentally Im pretty sure Ive never dipped a chip or a nugget into ketchup in my life Becci Wood 31 London When we had fruit salad at school I used to put the oranges in my sock Cant even be in a room with the smell of oranges  and definitely not in a train carriage Ive moved carriages on the tube more times than most people have had hot dinners Also cant abide the look of that skin around the segments When we had fruit salad at school in the early 70s I used to put the oranges in my sock My mother was delighted with this on wash day I dont feel entirely the same about lemons limes or grapefruit  Im happy around the juice zest flavour and smell of those though still wouldnt even entertain eating a whole segment Just the thought of it is making me nervous Jayne Pearson 59 Cornwall My maths teacher put me off coffee No love for the latte Photograph Barbara Cameron PixAlamy Ive survived so far without letting coffee pass my lips I think it stems from having to see my Alevel maths teacher first thing in the mornings to get some help I would walk into the office to be greeted by an overwhelming stale coffee smell and then his coffee breath I even went to Ethiopia and frequented coffee shops with coffee grinds on the floor but couldnt bring myself to drink any Although I dont drink it I am able to discern between cheap coffee and freshly ground coffee I feel like retching when I smell cheap coffee freshly ground coffee is only a tad more bearable It goes without saying that I dont eat anything with coffee in it either tiramisu coffee cake etc Not succumbing to the coffee craze over the years has saved me a fortune AJ 36 Surrey I hated carbonated drinks as a child and that hasnt really let up Ive never had a sip of CocaCola or Pepsi despite them being on offer at every birthday party or restaurant I hated carbonated drinks as a child and that hasnt really let up in early adulthood I prefer beer flat and find that tonic detracts a good deal from gin Soda just wasnt in my childhood home growing up in the same way that network TV or fastfood packaging or the Bible werent I never realised that my upbringing was odd or unusual or unAmerican Now its a fun story for my Dutch and other international friends they have an American classmate whos never had CocaCola or watched an episode of Friends and is possibly less American than they are I dont know if Id try it Its not something that would make me retch but between the carbonation and the sugar content Id probably find it unpleasant Jan 20 Groningen American living in the Netherlands I dont like squishy foods like banana I havent had a banana since I was about six months old I went off them and I have no intention of ever revisiting them Its the smell it makes me feel ill Then theres the texture  I dont like soft and squishy food I used to hate meatloaf for the same reason I had some in Tennessee in 1990 and I found it dry and rather like eating sawdust Then I met the woman who became my wife I gamely tried her meatloaf for supper one night and realised that my first experience of meatloaf had been appallingly bad and that it was possible to have lovely tasty meatloaf So I changed my mind on that at least Marc Jones 52 London Milkshake makes me gag The concept of a milkshake is not a problem but the thought of actually sitting down and drinking one leaves me in a cold sweat In my postwar early schooling when school milk was compulsory to build us up I was forced to drink a small bottle of milk for the first few days Having thrown up over myself the teaching staff the desk and the classroom floor I knew a glass of milk wasnt for me The thought of thickened flavoured milk makes me gag And no I wouldnt  couldnt  ever try it Joan Baker 81 York Cucumber sandwiches are just not going to happen Fancy yet unappealing Photograph ScotStockAlamy I was always picky with food as a child and have really grown into liking lots of different types of food My biggest issues are raw tomato iceberg lettuce and cucumber So most side salads in the world which is really annoying But something about cucumber sandwiches just screams out to me I love a tea party and they seem very fancy despite being very simple but isnt that part of the elegance I would love to be able to serve them with friends over with a pot of tea scones and other treats but its just not going to happen for me sadly Thom French 34 Hackney London The thought of kiwi makes my face ache I love all fruit and veg  except for some bizarre reason kiwi fruit The very thought of them makes my face ache and I get the same aversion sensation as fingernails scraping on a blackboard Ive no idea why Seeing an unpeeled kiwi fruit gives me a much worse sensation than a peeled and sliced one There is something about its skin that makes my skin crawl I cant imagine what the poor kiwi fruit has ever done to make me react in this way I might be persuaded to try a piece but only if someone else has peeled it for me Cathy Elder 61 Cardiff

said was a good pair of ears Stein who has died aged 80 might have added indefatigable enthusiasm a streak of opportunism and a shrewd business brain all of which he deployed in a career that saw him sign the deals that launched the careers of Madonna the Ramones Talking Heads kd lang and many others Those artists enjoyed their first hits on Sire Records the label Stein cofounded in 1966 and with which he remained synonymous even after his company had been absorbed by the Warner Music group By the time he stood down in 2018 unhappy with corporate politicking Steins achievements had long since earned him a place among the finest record men  as they were known  of his generation I have no easily definable skills or talents Im a hit man a record business entrepreneur he wrote in the introduction to his autobiography Siren Song in 2018 He played no instrument and had no technical knowledge for which he was ultimately grateful believing it might have got in the way of an appreciation of artists who could not be judged by conventional musical standards Seymour Stein centre with Madonna and the Talking Heads frontman David Byrne at the 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction dinner in New York Photograph KMazurWireImage The story of how Stein acquired the US rights to the thenunknown British band Depeche Mode for his label typified his modus operandi based on instinct and energy One day in 1980 he picked up the latest issue of a British music paper in his New York office and read about a new group signed by a UK contact Daniel Miller to his Mute Records label On a hunch he grabbed his passport booked a ticket to London on Concorde and went straight from the airport to meet the group in Basildon Essex their home town an hours drive east of London I signed them on the spot he remembered Their subsequent success made them one of a string of British bands whose records he released in the US When his rivals called him an anglophile it was not always he recalled meant as a compliment But it was British musicians from the Climax Blues Band to the Smiths who provided a bedrock for his business To sign Madonna Ciccone in 1982 he summoned the singer to his bedside at the hospital where he had undergone heart surgery Having listened to her demo tape he offered the 24yearold 45000 for three singles with the option to release an album Going on to sell more than 60m albums in the US alone while helping to reshape feminism for a new generation of young women she was his greatest success Seymour Stein with Michael Jackson in 2003 Photograph Sipa

Poland and Ukraine His father was employed in Manhattans garment industry while his mother worked at her familys market in Coney Island A heart murmur in infancy kept him away from sports at Lafayette high school where he discovered that he preferred applying his prodigious memory to Billboard magazines charts of current bestselling pop records than to his lessons The love of music was kindled by listening to the records brought home by his older sister During a summer holiday he talked his way into an internship at Billboards offices on 47th Street and Broadway It was there that he met Syd Nathan the myopic asthmatic choleric boss of King Records the label of James Brown based in Cincinnati In 1961 Nathan suggested that he shorten his surname and offered him a job asking Do you want to be a spectator or do you want to be in the game It was at King that Stein learned from the ground up how the record business really worked His knowledge would be expanded while working for George Goldner another oldtime record man at the Red Bird label where the ShangriLas and the Dixie Cups were the hit acts There he met the songwriter and producer Richard Gottehrer with whom he founded Sire

BayleyRedferns After Gottehrer had left the label in the mid1970s Stein and his wife Linda could be seen patrolling the New York clubs scouting a new generation of local bands They were quick to pounce on the Ramones with their twominute blasts of brattish attitude and the cooler artschool rock of Talking Heads From the UK came Echo and the Bunnymen Soft Cell and the Pretenders whose American singer Chrissie Hynde was impressed by Steins extraordinary recall of lyrics old and new As well as continuing to sign emerging acts  many of them from the UK such as My Bloody Valentine Aphex Twin and Everything But the Girl  Stein also played a significant role in the later careers of established stars Brian Wilsons eponymous first solo LP was released on Sire in 1988 the following year Lou Reeds artistic momentum was revived by the first of a series of Sire albums titled New York While on a constant search for new music Stein used his fortune to eat well and to collect art and antiques including The Siren by the preRaphaelite painter John William Waterhouse which he sold at Sothebys in London in 2018 for a reported 5m In 1983 he helped found the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame into which he was inducted in 2005 He and Linda Adler were married in 1971 shortly after she had recovered from the shock of his announcement that he was gay Their formidable and often turbulent partnership

model for several preRaphaelite artists in the mid19th century After dying prematurely aged 32 Elizabeth Siddal was marked down for decades as a depressive and laudanum addict and was portrayed as such in Ken Russells 1967 BBC film Dantes Inferno  named after her husband Dante Gabriel Rossetti More recently she has been mythologised in several TV dramas and novels  even as a vampire victim Only now with The Rossettis exhibition opening on 6 April at Tate Britain will Siddal finally be judged for what she really was and achieved  a considerable artist in her own right Admittedly she had some bouts of poor health and suffered not surprisingly after giving birth to a stillborn daughter in 1861 However this exhibition with several previously unseen works will show Siddal as an independent woman who was not just a talented artist but also had a strong influence on the career of Rossetti Siddal was for so long considered as either just a model or as a derivative artist who simply followed the male preRaphaelites says Carol Jacobi curator of The Rossettis This is so inaccurate Siddal was untrained as an artist as a teenager working in clothes shops in central London where she taught herself to design dresses She was introduced to the preRaphaelites just as the group formed in 1849 before meeting Rossetti and becoming the model in his Rossovestita portrait In 1852 she sat for Millaiss Ophelia and other preRaphaelites such as William Holman Hunt She then began to draw and paint herself encouraged by Rossetti and her patron John Ruskin who gave her an allowance She also wrote poetry And yet during the 1850s as she began a relationship with Rossetti  though one which it is not thought was consummated until their marriage in 1860  her work was dismissed by the preRaphaelites as a pale imitation of Rossetti There were even claims that Rossetti helped paint her watercolours Regarded as an appendage to her husband she remained unknown during her lifetime outside the small and bitchy preRaphaelite circle However The Rossettis featuring 17 of her drawings and watercolours along with Jan Marshs forthcoming biography Elizabeth Siddal Her Story plus new research by Glenda Youde a York University historian highlight her as a skilled artist Dante Gabriel Rossettis portrait of Elizabeth Siddal Photograph ArchivartAlamy They also prove that she had a real influence on Rossetti by comparing and contrasting the work of the two artists in the exhibition They were together after all in the same studio says Youde You can see her effect on the style in paintings which Rossetti did himself either during her lifetime or especially afterwards This view is supported by Marsh In many cases it was Rossetti who was adopting and responding to her ideas and

several kept inside a leatherbound book that in 1862 Rossetti buried beside her body in Highgate cemetery in north London Seven years later the book was removed after the tomb was controversially opened Owned for many years by the University of Delaware in the US a loose sheet of paper with Rossettis original crossingsout and changes for The Portrait will be seen for the first time at the Tate Alongside will be Rossettis most famous portrait of Siddal  Beata Beatrix After her death Rossetti asked a friend to photograph about 60 of her drawings as another memory of her Displayed at the Tate will be three pages of this album plus some glass negatives again not shown before There is however one unsolved mystery Siddal is known to have completed one selfportrait  a rendering showing her red locks and stern expression Siddal painted it in 1853 but it has not been seen publicly for more than a century although it was photographed about 50 years ago This photograph is in the exhibitions catalogue Both Marsh and Youde are convinced that someone in the Rossetti family either in the UK or Italy has it Maybe this exhibition will inspire the owner to let it be seen publicly again

toughlooking fellow but theres a sadness about him  hes up against this thing that he cannot do anything about it said Joseph He included a reference to the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George an honour that was criticised in 2020 because it includes the image of Saint Michael standing on the neck of a chained Black man portrayed as a devil In Josephs portrait Saint Michael is replaced by Muhammad Ali in the famous pose he made when he knocked out Sonny Liston in their second fight in May 1965 while the devil is replaced by Saint Michael He said Johnson wouldnt have fought any Black

yellow  Rich and ripe and mellow Unfortunately as you listen you are obliged to look at her brother Dante Gabriel Rossettis 184950 painting The Annunciation displayed like the icon it isnt in the middle of the space Where Christinas images have a crystalline exactitude that makes them pretty much timeless this work is strictly for buffs of Victoriana It is like some sort of taxidermy exhibit a leaden quotation of medieval art thats neither properly medieval nor bitingly modern Although this exhibition strives to set her verse alongside his art theres only so far you can go with bringing literature into the gallery via poems printed on walls Her steady quiet voice is drowned out by his lurid paintings of lusciouslipped beauties It looks as if DG never tried to draw anyone or anything freshly from life ever His pseudoRenaissance paintings are heavily worked up concoctions of symbolist erotica  and it turns out his drawings are like that too When he sketches his models who are his lovers he never sticks with what he sees but transfigures them in abstracted simplified lines Not that hes an abstract artist Just an emptily idealising one Surely the reason why he never completed Found is that he knew it was an awful painting The PreRaphaelite Brotherhood were a bunch of soso male artists who got together in 1848 to dress up their art in the borrowed robes of 15thcentury religious fervour and promote themselves as social saviours But the wall text will have us believe they were revolutionaries who wanted to express themselves authentically with art and poetry based on lived experience and nature that they were a group of young men and women in spite of stressing Brotherhood in their name Thus were told that John Everett Millaiss 1850 watercolour A Baron Numbering his Vassals actually depicts the class conflicts of 1840s Britain Really It looks like a placid portrayal of medieval folk to me The show pushes its exaggerated political claims for the preRaphaelites to absurdity in an extended exploration of Rossettis unfinished painting Found in which a woman of the streets who has collapsed against a wall is saved from death by a rustic In a series of halfpainted halfbaked canvases Rossetti dwells on the sensual face of his model Fanny Cornforth in a way that ludicrously undermines the supposed social message of the work The exhibition takes it all with leaden literalism as a radical revolutionary indictment of Victorian capitalism In reality its a collision between Rossettis erotic narcissism and his attempt to create a conscientious painting Surely the reason he never completed Found is because he knew it was awful Dante Gabriel Rossettis Proserpine Photograph Matt Greenwood Tate If there was a preRaphaelite painter who fitted this shows vision of a socialistfeminist critique of the Victorian social order that artist was William Morris not Rossetti Morris actually was a socialist But while he was trying to design Utopia Rossetti was having an affair with and painting his wife Jane And while the morally fervent John Ruskin was praising and buying not only his art but that of his lover and eventual wife Elizabeth Siddal Rossetti was betraying Siddal with Cornforth In its desperation to see the Rossettis as highminded and progressive this exhibition makes a startling factual error A wall text explaining Rossettis 1859 painting Bocca Baciata tells us it illustrates The Decameron a sensual medieval Italian poem by Giovanni Boccaccio The same claim is in the catalogue But there is no medieval poem called The Decameron It is the founding masterpiece of Italian prose a collection of ribald stories thats an ancestor of the modern novel Rossetti in fact is illustrating the seventh tale on the second day of The Decameron in which an eastern princess on her way to marry the Prince of Algarve is shipwrecked before being pursued and in effect raped by a series of men So this painting is very far from the romantic radicalism this exhibition claims for him In portraying his lover Fanny Cornforth as Boccaccios princess he seems rather to be making a dirty joke or sexual boast What a laugh DG Rossetti was no radical pinup but at least he supported Siddal to become an artist Her paintings like his depict Arthurian romances with brightly hued passion But their combination of selftaught naive drawing with preRaphaelite fantasy is often clumsy and inert Then again thats also true of the more technically refined works of the male preRaphaelites skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Art Weekly Free weekly

even though its owned by Tate probably because it wants to get away from the myth of Siddal She was a real person  but she quickly became a fantasy figure for Rossetti who cherished a lock of her hair  exhibited here  and later got his friends to open her grave in Highgate Cemetery London Christina had her brothers number Her poem In an Artists Studio printed on a wall here evokes a mysterious model whose face looks out from all his canvases This omnipresent nameless girl haunts the artists work He feeds upon her face by day and night Its the preRaphaelite muse a myth this show signally

leading heart surgeons have warned Ther 4190 chars,Critically ill patients will inevitably die because hospitals are having to cancel surgery as a direct result of next weeks junior doctors strike in England leading heart experts have warned There were bound to be fatalities among people with serious heart problems whose precarious health meant they were a ticking timebomb and needed surgery as soon as possible they said They added that patients would face an even greater risk than usual of being harmed or dying if their timesensitive operation was delayed because NHS heart units would have too few medics available during the fourday stoppage by junior doctors to run normal operating lists The trio of cardiac experts are senior doctors at the Royal Brompton and Harefield specialist heart and lung hospitals in London Those facilities plus the cardiac unit at St Thomas hospital in the capital have between them postponed between 30 and 40 operations they were due to conduct next week on P2 patients whose fragile health means they need surgery within 28 days One of our trusts core values is to put patients first and so I feel it is only right to warn that some patients will inevitably die due to the cumulative impact of delaying hundreds who are on the waiting list said Dr Richard GrocottMason a cardiologist who is also the chief executive of the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals Those cancellations would mean that many of the 300 P2 patients waiting for heart surgery at the three hospitals would have to wait even longer before they finally got it he added P2s are the NHSs secondhighest priority group of patients who need surgery of any sort behind emergency cases who need it immediately as their life will otherwise be at risk It is no exaggeration to say that delaying surgery for this group P2s will result in harm For some this may be lifechanging For others it may mean premature death GrocottMason said Dr Mark Mason a cardiologist who is the medical director for heart lung and critical care at the Guys and St Thomas NHS trust that runs all three hospitals said Its a cliche but these P2 patients really are sat on a ticking timebomb The risk of them suffering a cardiac arrest rose the longer they had to wait for surgery he added If they do its then a question of how lucky they are to have a bystander perform CPR on them and how quickly the ambulance gets to them These patients are sat waiting for an unpredictable and potentially fatal cardiac event to happen Last months first threeday strike by junior doctors in England over their demand for a 35 pay rise led to 175000 outpatient appointments and operations being cancelled NHS bosses fear next weeks fourday stoppage which starts at 7am on Tuesday 11 April will force them to reschedule as many as 250000 appointments GrocottMason Mason and their colleague Mario Petrou the Brompton and Harefield hospitals clinical director for cardiovascular services decided to speak out to raise concerns  widely shared by senior doctors and NHS doctors  about patients with a range of serious health problems including cancer potentially coming to harm next week because their surgery is cancelled We cannot in all conscience stand by and just let this happen without advocating for our current and future patients said GrocottMason referring to his teams cardiovascular patients Heart patients across the country will face the same risks as most heart units are taking the same type of action and postponing operations listed for next week Sadly this increased risk is going to be true for patients needing planned heart surgery not just in London but across England said GrocottMason The British Medical Associations junior doctors committee decided not to offer any derogations or exemptions for any areas of lifeordeath care next week including AE and intensive care and maternity services in an attempt to ramp up pressure on the government The three surgeons urged the government and the BMA to hold talks to try to avert a strike and asked the BMA to rethink its stance on derogations and instead allow junior doctors to keep working next week in critical care units and cardiovascular surgery GrocottMason said the BMA should follow the lead of the Royal College of Nursing which exempted many areas of lifeordeath care from the strikes it has held since December A BMA spokesperson said Ahead of the first round of industrial action NHS England worked with trusts across England to assess their readiness for the planned industrial action In addition a joint communication from NHS Englands medical director and Prof Philip Banfield BMA chair of council was shared with all trusts in England explaining the process to request a derogation We met with NHS England four times per day during the strikes and not a single request was made over the course of three days of action The same arrangements will exist this time and it will be up to NHS England to decide if they want to use them

series started and ended last week Not a full takeover of the station just a few pointed programmes about the state of the UKs rented housing each one packed with devastating facts In Hunt for a Home where we met Kieran and many others desperate to rent we were told that the average house price in the UK is now nine times the average wage A ratio not seen since 1876 said the presenter Rima Ahmed from BBC Radio Leeds Other facts 500000 homes have been taken out of the English private market since 2018 40 local authorities didnt buy or acquire any social housing between 2016 and 2021 on average there are 13 households applying for each new rental Then in All Work and No Homes Pennie Stuart talked to people in Ullapool in the Highlands where there are lots of jobs but no homes for those who want to fill them There are a few available but they are massively expensive local house prices are 130 of the Scottish average wages 87 of the Scottish average This is an easy gig for Ross and an

Vienna her home since leaving London When it comes to housing this is another universe she says In what way Well after the first world war Vienna decided to take housing by the scruff of the neck and now it has various city laws that mean that rents are subsidised and housing developers must designate twothirds of their new buildings as lowincome housing Now 60 of people living in Vienna enjoy subsidised rent Lang also visited Tower Bridge in London to look at houseboat communities and checked out communal housing in various cities all very interesting In Ullapool meanwhile businesses are trying to sort the housing problems themselves setting up flats and glamping pods so that when they advertise a job they can say accommodation is provided In Yorkshire though things arent getting any better Landlords are selling up because of increased mortgage payments a lack of tax relief on mortgage interest and other new rules Poor Alexandra has never missed a rental payment in 14 years but her landlord defaulted on a mortgage payment and the bank is about to repossess her flat She cant find anything to rent privately so shes trying the council I will take the tent I will put the tent in

30m But this is a previously unrecorded antiquity that can never be sold For the large fragment of a Sasanian rock relief  which depicts an imposing male figure carved in the 3rd century AD  has been freshly gouged from a cliff in Iran with an angle grinder It was heading for the black market in Britain when it was seized at Stansted airport Border Force officers became suspicious when they saw its haphazard packaging perhaps intended to suggest that it was a worthless item The antiquity which is over one metre in height was hacked out of living rock or rock that has been carved in situ Dr St John Simpson a senior curator and archaeologist in the British Museums department of the Middle East said We almost never come across a case of something being cut out of the living rock Thats a level of brutalism that surpasses anything Youve even got felttip marks on the back before theyve used an angle grinder to slice diagonally behind it and across the top It was then packed in an incredibly bad manner in a small almost unpadded crate held together with nails If it had been a stateof theart arthandling type crate that would have attracted a different sort of attention because it required all sorts of paperwork He has identified it as a unique rock relief sculpture dating to the period of the Sasanian empire AD224651 It belongs to a period when Iran was the centre of a powerful empire stretching from Syria to the Caucasus and Central Asia and with its capital at Ctesiphon south of presentday Baghdad he said The Sasanians were powerful rivals of Rome and famous today for their fine silverwares and cut glass As it was carved from a calcareous limestone which is found across Iran it is impossible to pinpoint the exact location There are only about 30 known Sasanian rock reliefs in existence mostly dating to the third century Almost all are in a relatively small part of Iran in their ancestral homeland of Fars province Simpson said We suspect it comes from somewhere in the Shiraz area Stylistically it is similar to one known in the region I think it probably is part of a big sequence There might be more bits out there The lack of an inscription makes it impossible to identify the person depicted but his dress and diademed headdress signifies him as a person of high rank His gesture of greeting and submission with a raised bent forefinger is a feature of Sasanian art when figures are in the presence of royalty which suggests that this was part of a larger composition with the king to the right and perhaps other figures behind The relief had broken into two because it had been so badly packed The British Museum has now had it repaired by conservators It looks amazing Simpson said It is stunningly attractive The valuation could be anything really Were talking 20m to 30mplus Theres never been anything like it on the market He said the artefact would be incredibly valuable on the black market Looters were apparently undeterred by severe penalties in place if they are caught he added In Iran they still have the death penalty for trafficking of antiquities People have been tried and executed in Iran within the last couple of decades Were seeing more Iranian material  people are willing and able to break the sanctions despite the death penalty Dr St John Simpson British Museum But in the last few years weve seen more Iranian material So that means that people are willing and able to break the sanctions The case has been investigated by Interpol and the National Crime Agency but no arrests have been made so far although the packaging stipulated the sender recipient and destination  a UK internet auction site which said that it was not expecting it After the object was formally forfeited to the Crown the British Museum received permission from the Iranian government to display it for three months before sending it to the National Museum in Tehran In a statement Seyed Mahdi Hosseini Matin charg daffaires of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London said We sincerely hope that further expansion of cooperation between the British Museum and the Iranian Embassy in London would continue to be effective in fighting against illicit trafficking of cultural properties and protect the cultural heritage of mankind

author Deborah Levy began to sit for her portrait The starting point was a selfie  eyes penetrating lips sensuous head topped by a tower of chestnut hair The artist her friend Paul HeberPercy used Photoshop then a pencil and tracing paper to reverse and multiply the image of her face until he had a drawing neatly laid out on a grid that satisfied him Then it was time to paint He liked to work in the mornings in hourlong bursts in his tiny attic studio When Levy came for sittings hed bring the painting down to the dining room and the two of them would drink tea or wine and talk Not that these were sittings in the traditional sense but times I could observe her without feeling selfconscious he said Sometimes theyd discuss Levys new novel August Blue which she was finishing but mostly it was everyday things  friends the news exchanging recipes how to unblock a sink said Levy But HeberPercy told me nothing about these conversations was really everyday She is the sort of person who makes the mundane remarkable Even going down to the bakery with her to get a baguette becomes a slightly magical thing her friend the novelist Tash Aw told me When her friends talk about her they say things like this she is an event she is a personage she is a whole world People often remember the first time they met her For Kate Bland an audio producer it was at a party at a Shoreditch warehouse Levy was sitting on a high windowsill Bland was leaning on it The authors rich slightly breathy voice was coming over Blands shoulder Talk unwound in a sequence of dazzling vignettes It seemed that there was a necessary theatricality we had to hoist ourselves out of the ordinariness of chat and have a conversation that was going to be memorable she recalled I was quite thrilled by it At the time of that party in 2008 Levy was 49 Her life had contained one immense dislocation when she was nine her family emigrated from South Africa to the UK after her father had spent three years as a political prisoner After school at a London comprehensive Levy took a theatre degree at the pioneering avantgarde Dartington College of the Arts in Devon and first forged a path as a playwright Her first novel Beautiful Mutants was published in 1989 the year she turned 30 Twenty years on at the time of the Shoreditch party she wasnt famous and hadnt sold more than a modest number of books though she carried herself as if she had She was teaching adapting Colette and Carol Shields for the radio raising two daughters and living with her husband playwright David Gale in a semidetached house off Holloway Road in north London She was working on a novel her first since 1996 Her previous books were out of print Four years later Levys life was transformed Her novel Swimming Home  a sundrenched story about a family holiday on the French Riviera beneath whose glinting surface runs a Freudian riptide of wartime trauma  was shortlisted for the 2012 Booker prize That sent sales flying At the same time her marriage fell apart By the time I went to the Booker dinner in December I knew I would be moving house and I was packing up she told me It was very turbulent and very painful The following year she published Things I Dont Want to Know the first in a trilogy of what she calls living autobiographies to convey their selective fictive nature Over the next few years she alternated two more novels Hot Milk and The Man Who Saw Everything with two more volumes of living autobiography which spoke of how after her marriage ended she recomposed a life for herself and her daughters in her 50s outside the old patriarchal structures All of these books she told me flew out of her like a cork coming out of a bottle Levys novels are popular and critically acclaimed But it is with the living autobiographies that her reputation has transcended the literary At events readers tell Levy that her books make them feel less lonely or ask her what to do about a life crisis One cant quite imagine readers doing this with say Rachel Cusk who also anatomises female experience but in a somewhat chillier style At one of Levys online readings during the Covid pandemic an audience member posted in the chat Im 41 with two kids and sometimes I dont feel Im at home at all  Did it work for you coming out of an unhappy marriage Levy answered It did work for me You have to make another sort of life and gather your friends and supporters to your table  which is pretty much the story of the second and third of her living autobiographies The Cost of Living and Real Estate Levy left in 2012 with fellow Man Booker shortlisted authors Tan Twan Eng Hilary Mantel Will Self Alison Moore and Jeet Thayil Photograph Luke MacGregorReuters Levys writing has a very particular quality it seems to infiltrate the mind You absorb her way of seeing and start to perceive the world in Levyish ways In her stories seemingly trivial moments take on political force an encounter with a hairdresser in The Cost of Living becomes a story about the camaraderie of women and what they reveal to each other a scene about sharing a table on the Eurostar becomes about how men literally and figuratively fail to make space for younger women In the new novel August Blue the narrator having been insulted by a young man in a cafe tells us I think he was expecting me to respond to reply in some way but I didnt care about him or his problems Ive used that in my own life more than once since first reading it The books become almost a guide to life said Gaby Wood director of the Booker Foundation She trains you to become your best self Part of the appeal of Levys writing is that it is shot through with unpatronising sympathy towards younger women  both the hesitant tough young female characters who populate her novels and those who appear in her living autobiographies often negotiating sticky situations with older entitled men In Real Estate there is a passage in which she describes her joy in cooking for her daughters friends I liked their appetite  yes for the dish prepared but for life itself I wanted them to find strength for all they had to do in the world and for all the world would throw at them She is not just talking about her daughters friends Levy is also in the business of feeding and strengthening her readers And they feel it The plays and the novels Levy wrote in her 20s and 30s are collagelike gravelly spiky and dense marinated in the eastern European avantgarde influences she absorbed at college She had a talent for epigrammatic slightly surreal sentences I once heard a man howl just like a wolf except he was standing in a phone box in Streatham says a character in her first novel But the work had not yet acquired the razoredaway spare quality that has given the later work such airiness such ripple and flow nor was there the emotional force with which readers identify so strongly It was in the late 2000s that she forged the style that transformed her reputation She was working at the Royal College of Art at the time Two days a week shed take the tube from the fumes of Holloway Road to green South Kensington She was a tutor in the animation department helping students learn to write and construct narrative It was a potent time she told me when we met in September Her colleagues at the Royal College of Art were inspiring so were her students At nights while her young daughters slept she was writing Swimming Home I was somehow living closer to my own emotions and understood that I might be able to put them to work in my book She had always felt that emotion was frowned upon by her avantgarde art family but from Swimming Home onwards I decided to totally upend that Charging the story with feeling changed her writing  and her relationship with readers I knew I was on to something and it rocked me she told me There were times when Id stop writing and Id come down to cook my daughters spaghetti in the evening There was a sort of cool place under the steps and I was so on fire I would just stand there and cool down What Levy found in her writing was a way of giving her story a shimmering attractive surface while allowing her preoccupations with literary theory myth and psychoanalysis to occupy its murkier depths The novel can be taken as a kind of holiday novel gone wrong she said  and it has been slipped into many a suitcase as a beach or poolside read Im happy if the surface is read she told me Because everything else is there to be found And Im working hard for my readers to find it But I dont look down on readers who dont I think Something will come through The something might include the Freudian desire and deathwish that suffuses the novel its peculiar linked imagery of sugar mice and rats above all the immense treacherous undertow of history  of the Holocaust of 20thcentury suffering and wars  that Levy sketches into the story with almost imperceptible strokes But Swimming Home was rejected by every major publisher it was sent to Levy in all her certainty that it was good was devastated The years following the financial crisis of 2008 were inhospitable to a midlist novelist who hadnt been in print for a while The publishing industry was in trouble the powerful new wave of feminism of the 2010s was a whisper rather than a roar and the kind of spare experimental books by women that would come to define recent literary trends such as Cusks autofictional Outline trilogy or Annie Ernauxs intimate unfurling of memory or Elena Ferrantes revelatory novels on female friendship had yet to appear in Britain At the time she said your book was either going to sell or it wasnt going to sell and when they said it was too literary they meant it wasnt going to sell Then in summer 2009 something changed A friend of Levys the late Jules Wright who ran an arts centre in east London read the manuscript She was organising a show on photographer Dean Rogers who documented the sites of car crashes that had killed cultural heroes  the spot for example where Marc Bolan died Swimming Home begins with a scene in which Kitty Finch a young woman with a death wish perilously drives an older poet with whom she believes she has a telepathic connection along a winding mountain road Wright decided to have the first two pages of the book printed large and installed at the beginning of the exhibition Not long after the opening though she called Levy and bluntly announced she was removing them It was a disaster she said  people were clogging the entrance as they stopped to read the text It was Levy told me the first spark that those two pages of this muchdeclined book were gathering a crowd around them Eventually the novel did find its publisher a tiny new press called And Other Stories The literary translator Sophie Lewis was editor there Levys pitch remarkably given all the rejections was supremely confident Deborah told me This is the tightest book Ive ever written and its going to be a bestseller Lewis remembered In autumn 2011 Levys friend Charlotte Schepke who runs Large Glass gallery in London hosted the launch party They decided to project The Swimmer the 1968 Burt Lancaster film on to the wall On the night to Schepkes immense surprise you couldnt stand  the place was absolutely packed It was rammed Her interesting new friend who had written witty labels for the opening show at her small gallery earlier that year was suddenly making waves It was almost said Schepke as if shed done this grand thing of claiming to be an author  and then suddenly she really was an author Burt Lancaster and Janet Landgard in The Swimmer 1968 Photograph MoviestoreRexShutterstock In her living autobiographies Levy frequently refers to her rented shed a writing space in a friends garden on whose roof the apples used to fall in autumn with a dull thunk These days as she moves deeper into her 60s the shed has been replaced by an attic in Paris a few blocks behind the bookshop Shakespeare  Company near the Seine When I visited her there on a limpid blue February day she had pinned a branch of yellow mimosa to her front door Its flowering marked she said the end of gloomy ratgrey January The studio was as near to the platonic ideal of a Paris garret as you could imagine reached by a winding stair through a courtyard and with low ceilings and wooden beams Kilim rugs were scattered on the floor and her bed was covered in a fluffy sheepskin throw There was a stash of red wine in the fireplace Everything about the studio radiated her delight in objects and food and pleasure reminding me of how when wed met for lunch at a London pavement cafe the previous July despite the overwhelming heat shed ordered a vermouth on ice followed by a pizza topped off by a strong coffee and a rollup If you met the author and saw the studio before you read the work you might expect something more excessive and elaborate than the strippeddown translucent prose she produces She poured coffee from a moka pot and passed me a dish heaped with croissants from her local boulangerie La Maison DIsabelle pastries from the same shop turn up in the new novel Objects from her real world often slip into her fiction There was a biography of Isadora Duncan faceout on a shelf perhaps the same book about the dancer she has her character Elsa read in August Blue On a table stood a bowl of pearl necklaces and at her throat were pearls  like the pearl necklace she has her beautiful careless character Saul wear in her novel The Man Who Saw Everything Things in her stories often hold the kind of powerful significance that Freud attaches to artefacts in dreams  such as the pool in Swimming Home which at its most basic Levy pointed out is a rectangular hole in the ground and thus also metaphorically a grave She loves the surrealists The turning point of Hot Milk is the moment when her narrator Sofia discovers boldness through making bloody handprints on the kitchen wall of a man who has been tormenting his dog  a scene borrowed from a story told about the artist Leonora Carrington who letting herself into the apartment of her prospective lover Luis Buuel smeared menstrual blood over his pristine white walls Motifs slip between books too in this she has something in common with a visual artist building a subtly interconnected body of work The title August Blue for example is taken from the colour of the thread that in Hot Milk one character Ingrid uses to embroider Sofias name into a shirt Horses in particular gallop through Levys work  from the tiny horseshaped buttons that in Real Estate she kept from her late stepmothers button box to the moment Ingrid appears in the desert landscape on horseback like a bellicose goddess in the mythinfused Hot Milk The whole of August Blue hangs on striking images of horses it begins with her character the pianist Elsa watching jealously as a woman she thinks might be her doppelganger buys a pair of mechanical dancing horses in an Athens flea market Levy laughed when I asked her about her equine enthusiasms Thats a case for Dr Freud she said She ponders in Real Estate what it is to be a woman on your high horse Sometimes she writes you might find yourself incapable of controlling your high horse at other times people are all too eager to to pull you off it She imagines a friend riding her high horse down the North Circular to repair her smashed screen at Mr Cellfone When I think of Levys horses I also think of her adoration of her small fleet of ebikes now famous from her living autobiographies which she stables by her London flat and lends to friends when they visit she bought her first when she moved out of her marriage and into her new life When they start up with a little equine surge of power she told me its hard not to whoop every time When Levy was a small child in South Africa and her father Norman Levy was imprisoned for his antiapartheid activism she started to speak so quietly that her voice became barely audible What saved her from this state of virtual silence was her imagination the dawning understanding that she could write other realities It was a question Levy told me of finding avatars The avatar she created for her nineyearold self was a cat with wondrous powers of flight  perhaps unconsciously imagining freedom for her father as well as liberation for herself In Real Estate The Flying Cat is the name she gives to the ferry that brings her daughters to her for a holiday on a Greek island The characters in her fiction are still her avatars Im in every one of them she said including the cats and including the horses For a long time in adulthood she resisted writing or even talking about South Africa The difficulties of her family felt irrelevant she told me when set against the struggles of black South Africans But since she had decided to base the structure of Things I Dont Want to Know on George Orwells headings in his essay Why I Write  one of which is historical impulse  she found herself obliged to tackle those repressed memories Using a childs eye view she said I tried to convey without using the old language of the bloodstained regime of apartheid what its like to be told that youre supposed to respect adults while there are white adults who are clearly doing very cruel things to children of colour my age Her mother Philippa through her husbands imprisonment coped alone earning a living through a succession of secretarial jobs Levy remembers her as capable and glamorous I loved the way she cooked with her cigarette holder and the way that shed dance a bit to the record shed put on when she came back from work When Levys father was released in 1968 he was banned from working and the family  Levy has an elder halfbrother from her mothers first marriage as well as a younger brother and sister  had little option but to emigrate Her father found work lecturing at Middlesex University among other places Money was tight Her parents marriage ended in 1974 After the blue sky and the bonewhite grass of the garden in Johannesburg arriving in London felt as if someone had pulled the plug out But despite Englands greyness she loved it She made for the first time proper friends I dont have that narrative of exile she told me of wanting to return to the place that you left She adored the way people spoke and she still delights in English turns of phrase Hello pet hello lamb hello duck As for her accent I had to lose it very quickly in the playground not to be beaten up She often plucks her characters out of their familiar environments partly in order to see their psychological foibles magnified on foreign shores She herself likes very much to be in a hot country in southern Spain or a Greek island swimming in the sea Sometimes these characters like her have been swept on the tides of 20thcentury history  like the English poet Joe in Swimming Home who is really Jozef smuggled out of d in 1943 or Lapinski in Beautiful Mutants whose mother was the iceskating champion of Moscow Levy told me of an interview in the news that moved her recently it was with a Ukrainian woman from Kherson who had been lying in bed thinking when she was blown into her kitchen by a Russian shell Those were her words I was lying in bed thinking said Levy I do not take a place of calm a place that is agreeable to think in for granted Levys senses are finely tuned to the fragility of things Works by Joseph Beuys at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Pantin France in 2012 Photograph Bertrand Rindoff PetroffGetty Images After her Alevels in the summer of 1978 she would walk past the Gate cinema in Notting Hill timidly noting the thrilling eccentrically dressed people who hung out there One day she saw an ad in the Evening Standard for frontofhouse staff For the interview she put on a pair of big gold platform wedges as she left the house her mother yelled Youll never get a job dressed like that Those gold wedges are the ancestors of the shoes that have carried her female characters on to victory or else to triumphant defeat the silver gladiator sandals that Ingrid like the goddess Athena straps high up her calves in Hot Milk the sagegreen Parisian tap shoes that get her into a scrape in Real Estate the brothel creepers that to her younger self marked me out for a meaningful life and the scuffed brown leather shoes with high snakeskin heels that we meet on page three of August Blue She got the job at the Gate Her new colleagues were either at drama school or off to university and all way cooler than me I was a nerdy writer  of poetry at the time  with a great love of Bowie The cinema was screening Derek Jarmans film Jubilee and he would come in and he was curious and charismatic and friendly and cultured and he didnt feel above talking to this 18yearold making the popcorn tearing the tickets and scooping the ice cream It was Jarman who told her she should apply not to university but to Dartington where shed learn about improvisation and dance and avantgarde theatre and art It was at this time not having the kind of parents who dragged her round galleries at weekends that she encountered contemporary art for the first time It was an exhibition of the work of Joseph Beuys She remembers she told me a grand piano muffled and covered with cloth marked with a cross other objects made of gold leaf dried plants tacked to the wall things scribbled in pencil I remember almost not being able to breathe And there was this voice inside my head saying This is it This is it And I had no idea what it was The Cost of Living opens with the narrator witnessing an encounter between a young woman and an older man in a bar in Colombia The man whom Levy calls the Big Silver invites the young woman to his table After she tells him a strange story about a perilous diving expedition he remarks that she talks a lot and carelessly knocks her book off the table Levy writes It had not occurred to him that she might not consider herself to be the minor character and him the major character It is a very Levyish story in its wry observation of dynamics between men and women and with its implicit call to arms to women who have as the critic Dwight Garner has put it come to sense theyre not locked into their lives and stories Levy herself is without doubt a major character  and is intent on expanding the role She has an immense appetite for experiencing the strange dimensions of living and the absolutely practical dimensions she told me We were sitting at the time outside a cafe near the Panthon in Paris after a good lunch and Levy was smoking a rollup Im not endlessly open to experience I am easily bored and impatient I want to keep things moving keep thought moving I want to make something new of the old story How do you make the novel as complicated as life as interesting as life Thats what I want to do She has many plans She wants to adapt her two most recent novels for the screen Swimming Home and Hot Milk are in other scriptwriters hands She knows exactly she told me how the opening scene of August Blue will go and she has the perfect idea of how to tackle the temporal complexities of The Man Who Saw Everything which slips through its main characters fractured consciousness between the Berlin of 1988 and the London of 2016 In The Cost of Living Levy fantasises about living in California and writing scripts by her pool When I teased her lightly about the unlikelihood of this she said You never know I just might be there in my swimming costume at 80 writing films Id have a river now  with a little rowing boat tied to the jetty and Id smoke drink coffee and write my scripts I think probably in France In the meantime now that her daughters are in their 20s she comes from her London flat to work in her Paris studio for weeks at a time She is taking French lessons though presently her literary enthusiasms outstrip her linguistic ability I say Shall we translate this poem of Apollinaire together and my teacher says I think today Deborah we will try to master tre and avoir Her most natural creative affinities are in fact French  Godard Duras  rather than British To her evident delight Levy has won one of Frances most important literary awards the Prix Femina tranger She has not yet won a major prize in Britain despite multiple shortlistings perhaps because British prizes tend to favour large selfsufficient discrete slabs of fiction She begins her days early with a walk by the Seine After work there might be an exhibition or dinner  which she might depart more than one friend told me with sudden decision announcing that she is back off to work She looked abashed when I mentioned this habit worried she might appear rude to her friends Im immensely sociable and then I really need to be on my own I do like to write after a dinner party she said She herself loves to cook  delicious mountains of cream and garlic and the kitchen is like a bomb site Charlotte Schepke told me but its like being in the finest restaurant Her presence makes it an occasion At the moment in a sharp change of gear she is researching a biography of the young Gertrude Stein to be titled Mama of Dada She is concentrating on the writers early training under psychologist William James brother of the novelist Henry Levy wants to think about how this academically brilliant American  whod be late for her medical lectures because her bustled skirts were weighted down by horsehairstuffed hems  moved to Paris ditched the corset and became the pioneering modernist who dressed in monklike robes and filled her house with Picassos A presence with many selves  Paul HeberPercys portrait of Deborah Levy Photograph Sarah LeeThe Guardian Its a characteristic way for Levy to build character But while the books are rooted in the physical they also make room for the uncanny and the unexplained for the sudden intrusion into a persons consciousness of unwelcome memories or dark imaginings It would be very sad to have all the possibilities of the novel this hotair balloon but to say I only write social realism and the hotair balloon must never leave the ground she told me Thats not how peoples minds work people have very strange dreams and thoughts and daydreams and associations She is she said very careful not to let her hotair balloon float away into the clouds of fantasmagoria It is all in the balance and control What also earths Levys work is her wit She is so amused diverted and delighted by life said the actor Tilda Swinton who is a fan Her jokes often wryly commenting on her own failings make for a kind of intimacy even complicity  the kind of complicity that many of us can only relate to the dry land of childhood companionship said Swinton Levys women especially the I of the living autobiographies fail as well as succeed they have good days and bad They are neither feisty and gutsy  those tiresome cliches  nor are they selfsaboteurs who put themselves down to ingratiate themselves with the reader They are both real and offer an example of how to live well When Levy was finding a way to write her living autobiographies she searched for a voice that was immensely powerful immensely vulnerable immensely eloquent and totally inarticulate Because thats all of us In March I went back to Paul HeberPercys house to see her portrait finished It renders Levys face in triplicate as if seen through a kaleidoscope and her hair piled on her head soars upwards like Medusas snaky locks dissolving into abstract Rorschachlike patterns and repetitions It gave the impression of a presence with many selves in constant movement of thought In the portrait Levy has five large wideopen scrutinising eyes but one of her tripled faces disappears into the world outside the frame and the sixth eye is unseen August Blue will be published by Hamish Hamilton on 4 May and is available at

Red Sea What happened next is uncertain The most boring legend has Avery  AKA Henry Every or Long Ben  buried in a paupers grave in Barnstaple Devon Another recently endorsed in the book Pirate Enlightenment by the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber posits that Avery sailed for Madagascar where he established a pirate republic with his henchmen called Libertalia a protocommunist utopia where all goods were held common The National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth offers another account in its fascinating new exhibition Pirates After paying off his likeminded hearties in Mughal bling Avery sailed for home But nearing Cornwall he and his pirate booty were shipwrecked and lie deep in Davy Joness locker In the 1970s female pirates were seized on by feminists Now theyve become part of a different LGBTI discourse Or do they Stuart Slade museum deputy director wants to claim the king of pirates and the legend of the missing treasure for Cornwall He cites a tantalising 19thcentury document in Cornwalls Record Office in Redruth that purports to reveal the treasures location It says About three miles to the east of the Lizard  under three grey stones or rocks in a cove to the south west It is near where the corner of the high promontory just out into the sea He said the spring tides now cover the place One chest the document adds contains rubies sapphires emeralds topazes and diamonds another contains more than 150 gold ingots a third 3000 pieces of eight Girl power  an engraving of pirate Mary Read by A Catel Photograph National Maritime Museum Greenwich Although the area has been thoroughly searched says a caption in the exhibition nothing has been found Now is the time to fire up your metal detector  though if the treasure is ever discovered you would think the Indian government has first dibs Avery was the most successful of those men and women who thrived in the socalled golden age of piracy between 1650 and 1730 in the Atlantic and Indian oceans The exhibition aims to explore why pirates endure in the popular imagination It cant just be because of Johnny Depps appropriation of Keith Richards mockney drawl in the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise Slade says other dressy antinomian figures have their moments  who doesnt like a dandy highwayman  but that lawless swashbucklers on the high seas have captivated us ever since 1881 when Robert Louis Stevenson wrote the first half of Treasure Island But there is a chasm deeper than the Mariana Trench between piratical reality and fiction The gap between the beruffed dandies and fragile masculinities depicted in Taika Waititis recent sitcom Our Flag Means Death and Somali pirates plying the same waters as Avery did centuries earlier could not be more stark This point is made clear by a glass case containing an oldschool cutlass of the kind that captains Blood Hook and Blackbeard waved in anger alongside a replica AK47 the weapon of choice for todays real pirates Slade suggests that we can project our fantasies on to golden age pirates In the first half of the 20th century for instance pirate movies depicted white men think Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Sr on the high seas swinging in on a yardarm with a cutlass in their teeth to seize not only pirate booty but decorous damsels who from 2023s perspective seem victims of coercion This exhibition is keen to problematise such white supremacist masculine narratives by showing us queer pirates pirates of colour and female pirates Artwork commissioned for the show from Queer Kernow comes with this caption Pirates existed in the shadows in the margins of society  overthrowing societal conventions and creating their own counterculture Such figures as Anne Bonny Mary Read and John Calico Jack Rackham have as the note puts it queer resonances We project on this piratical other in lieu of historical fact our everchanging fantasies In the 1970s women pirates were seized on by feminists Now theyve become part of a different LGBTI discourse says Slade We project our fantasies on to them  poster for the 1926 film The Black Pirate Photograph Distributed by United Artists An 1852 engraving of Mary Read by A Catel for the book Histoire des Pirates depicts a bloodied tar lying vanquished on a beach The cutlasswielding pirate standing over him pulls back her top to reveal her breasts The mans shocked and rueful expression to me at least says Bad enough to be beaten but beaten by a girl Few pirates we learn were persons of colour  but reportedly six out of 10 of Edward Blackbeard Teachs crew were black Among them was Black Caesar posited here to have been west African and an enslaved person who escaped the wreckage of a slave ship during the Atlantic crossing and was later hanged in Williamsburg New York Many pirates realised that there was money to be made from African bodies It is tempting to imagine that freedomloving pirates might release enslaved people says the caption But usually they were treated just as inhumanely by the pirates and sold for profit or in some cases thrown overboard to drown Not surprisingly pirate legends are not especially alluring in todays Caribbean where many peoples ancestors were enslaved Alexis McDavid of the National Museum Jamaica says Today its seen as being very Eurocentric That said when the then Jamaican capital of Port Royal was partially destroyed by a 75magnitude earthquake in 1692 it was regarded as Gods wrath over this modern Sodom in which sex work and piracy thrived And Jamaica hasnt erased its piratical past today the sunken pirate city is a national heritage site open for diving excursions and hailed by some as an underwater Pompeii Short brutal lives  Blackbeards head on the bowsprit an illustration from The Pirates Own Book by Charles Ellms 1844 Photograph  National Maritime Museum Greenwich London The romantic idea of pirates living free and democratically outside straight society nonetheless persists Graeber suggested The toothless or peglegged buccaneer hoisting a flag of defiance against the world  is perhaps as much a figure of the Enlightenment as Adam Smith or Voltaire but he also represents a profoundly proletarian liberation necessarily violent and ephemeral Ephemeral is right Slade estimates that pirates lasted on average two years at their illegal trade before being hanged drowned or sensibly retiring In some iterations the Jolly Roger flag includes not just skull and crossbones but an hourglass to make the point that the life of the pirate was nasty brutish and  even if an adrenalinefuelled rollercoaster  short Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts AKA Black Bart or in Welsh Barti Ddu died aged 39 after seizing 400 prizes possibly a pirate world record Legend has it that Teach wove hemp into his beard and set it alight before battle in order to intimidate his enemies Fear as much as cutlasses and gunpowder was a leading weapon What apart from unimaginable riches and the promise of intercontinental legovers attracted people to become pirates It wasnt as hierarchical as the Royal Navy says Slade Captains were elected And they lived according to a code The exhibition sets out the code that prevailed on Black Barts ship According to article one Every man has a vote in affairs of moment has equal title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized and may use them at pleasure Bloody battles  Sea of Thieves the video game recreated at the show Photograph  Microsoft Exhibits include a haul of pieces of eight loaned from the British Museum and an immersive installation replicating the video game Sea of Thieves Perhaps the best exhibits in the show though are the mannequins dressed in replicas of the high street knockoffs of the pirate outfit Vivienne Westwood designed in 1981 If the gift shop doesnt include replicas of those replicas Ill be astounded If the pirates emerge from this show as questionable characters then its real hero is Stevenson whose Treasure Island created many of the enduring emblems of the pirate genre the onelegged rogue the cabin boy hiding in an apple barrel the map to the buried treasure marked by an X Former poet laureate Andrew Motion who has written two sequels to Treasure Island says of Stevenson He never wrote a bad line King of pirates  Henry Avery in Captain Charles Johnsons book A General History of the Pyrates Photograph  National Maritime Museum Greenwich London And yet Stevenson is neglected he rarely figures on school recommended reading lists Treasure Island is best known through words that are not Stevensons own  from illustrated abridgements and more than 50 film and TV adaptations including Muppet Treasure Island and one featuring Mr Magoo The show ends with a real gibbet loaned by Rye Castle Museum The golden age of piracy came to a bloody end in the 1730s as governments decided pirates were too much of a liability to trade and stamped them out We went back and forth on whether to include the gibbet says Slade But we decided that the brutal truth needs to be shown Captain Kidd was among the pirates to be executed He was hanged twice at Execution Dock in Wapping London The rope broke on the first attempt and despite some people in the crowd shouting it was a sign from God that he should be released minutes later he was hanged again His body was displayed on a gibbet at Tilbury Point over the River Thames  a warning to future pirates Avery probably eluded the noose though where he met his end and what happened to his treasure remains uncertain The likelihood is that there be treasure in these Cornish parts Jim lad Possibly

OFarrell spun a fable about the route of a plague to England in the summer of 1596 It started with a monkey three fleas and a cabin boy in the port of Alexandria and ended up making its way to Worcestershire in the wadding of a box of beads where it killed Hamnet the 11yearold son of a Latin teacher turned playwright A few years later William Shakespeare would premiere one of the worlds greatest tragedies Hamlet Shakespeare is known to have been touring a play in Kent at the time of his sons death Its not even known if he made it back to the funeral I hope he did says OFarrell who was so haunted by the story that she held off writing about it until her own son was safely past the age of 11 like Shakespeare she has a son and two daughters In her bestselling novel Hamnet she allowed the grieving father to be with his family at the graveside I think him arriving in my novel was a wishfulfilment for him The novel was published in spring 2020 just as the world was shutting down and its evocation of that earlier pestilence seemed part of its uncanny genius It went on to sell 15m copies worldwide and win the Womens prize for fiction Three years later it is on the brink of a new life in the town in which Hamnet died where a stage adaptation will reopen the Royal Shakespeare Companys Swan theatre after a threeyear closure before moving on to the West End in London The plague interlude is obviously no longer necessary says OFarrell because weve been there right Weve been to Alexandria and Venice in our heads as we sat isolated in our homes watching the news You no longer need to explain what a pestilence is Its not wonderful Its dark But weve had this collective experience To look at the family behind the man who made all this work has been an extraordinary thing Lolita Chakrabarti Hamnet tells the story of 18 years of Shakespeares life from the point of view of his wife who has traditionally been known as poor neglected Anne Hathaway the illiterate countrywoman who was left behind with their three children when her husband set off for the bright lights of London and was only bequeathed his secondbest bed Parish records revealed she was in fact christened Agnes by her sheepfarmer father OFarrell portrays her as a healer and herbalist pointing out that far from being this embittered wife abandoned in StratforduponAvon Agnes went on to invest her husbands earnings in her own malting business as well as running the big house he bought in 1597 for the princely sum of 60 in silver It was there that he chose to retire surrounded by his family and where he died at the age of 52 The woman who has been charged with transporting the story from page to stage is Lolita Chakrabarti an actor and playwright whose previous successes include adapting the multiawardwinning Life of Pi which has just opened on Broadway She had not read Hamnet before agreeing to take on the job Ive lived in Shakespeare Ive played in it and watched it she says It was Antony Shers RSC performance in Richard III that switched the lights on for her as a 15yearold surgeons daughter on a school outing from Birmingham But to look at the family behind the man who made this work has been an extraordinary thing And of course we never think of the woman behind the man do we But now that Ive read Maggies novel and been immersed in it the influence of Agnes and of their family just seems such an obvious thing Were talking over video call in a break from rehearsals Chakrabarti is downing a cup of soup in Stratford and OFarrell is clutching a mug of tea in her Edinburgh home Most of their communication was over email We did go back and forth quite a lot says OFarrell laughing as she recalls one particular email My husband asked how long it was and I realised it was 5000 words He said Jesus I feel sorry for Lolita I think I got quite carried away but very nicely she didnt say Why are you sending a 5000word essay about 16thcentury guild membership Lolita Chakrabarti in Shakespeares old schoolroom in StratforduponAvon Photograph Antonio OlmosThe Observer Actually says Chakrabarti I thought they were really good notes Sometimes it was about historical accuracy and sometimes because I had plucked something off Google to be the solution for the plague and Maggie very rightly said No its not that herb  its this one One of the challenges was to distil 18 years of interrupted life into a twohour play Writing chronologically complex plots is something that really appeals to me You can get away with flashbacks and flashforwards on the page but on stage its a lot more difficult so I had a bit of sympathy for Lolita says OFarrell Yeah there were actually lots of challenges says Chakrabarti Its about nature which is beautiful on film but how do you do that on stage And then there is the fact that a lot of it feels quite internal Agness intelligence unfolds in premonitions psychic instincts I dont know what it is but that kind of spiritual side of things Then there was the challenge of finding theatrical language for it Ive tried to take what Maggie intended and distil it into theatrical Tudor but current so that it places them in their time but were not too distanced from them as people says Chakrabarti Ive put in some vernacular colour that Ive invented to suggest it is in Warwickshire of that time I was really conscious that up until quite recently Shakespeare had become quite a middleclass thing when in Tudor times there were different accents from all around the country and all the actors were from everywhere I really didnt want this version to be RP received pronunciation Ive always felt that the best book youre going to write is the one you cant not write Maggie OFarrell The snobbishness of Shakespeare studies turned out to be a shared concern For OFarrell this meant rescuing both Agnes and to a certain extent Shakespeare himself from the class prejudice that had labelled the couple this literary genius saddled with an illiterate wife Why is there so much debate as to whether this provincial figure could have been responsible for some of the greatest plays in the English language she asks If you think about Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe they were both classically educated whereas Shakespeare probably left grammar school around the age of 15 Theres a feeling that therefore he couldnt have done it But just because you leave school doesnt mean you stop learning As for Agnes At that time of course there wasnt the education or the opportunities for her But it doesnt mean to say there werent different forms of intelligence and education Illiteracy doesnt equal stupidity or lack of intelligence you know Its such a narrow way to regard them As a novelist Im asking a reader to follow me through a forest a bit like Hansel and Gretel Maggie OFarrell Photograph David LevensonGetty Images The central question of Hamnet is the role that Agnes played in her husbands creative life I think any exclusion may only have extended to the geographical in that his work took place in London and she lived in the family home in Stratford Ive always been certain that you can find submerged traces of her everywhere in his work says OFarrell who tracked Agness influence through the recurrent motifs of herbs and birds in Shakespeares plays creating her own Elizabethan herb garden as part of her research into Agness medicinal wisdom The question of what constitutes a creative partnership is one that plays to the personal experience of both women OFarrell is married to a fellow novelist William Sutcliffe I wouldnt say we collaborate exactly but he is always my first reader and hes a very incisive one He doesnt pull his punches and isnt afraid to tell me when something isnt working  and while that is sometimes hard to hear its precisely what I need she says Chakrabarti is married to the actor Adrian Lester whom she first met aged 14 at Birminghams Midlands Arts Centre and who turned out to live in the same street They became a couple as drama students at Londons Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Rada and married in 1997 Because we are in the same business I understand the complete immersion you need in order to make a new role Of course life continues and chores need to be done but I am always surprised when I see the show on screen or on stage at what he has created It doesnt always fit with the demands of life but I know that focus is necessary she says Chakrabarti with the puppet of Richard Parker the tiger from her stage adaptation of Life of Pi at the 2022 Olivier awards The tigers seven puppeteers collectively won best actor in a supporting role Photograph David LeveneThe Guardian In 2020 the couple published a dizzying joint diary of a 16month period of their working lives when he was juggling work on the miniseries The Rook with trying to get his own film and theatre projects off the ground and she was combining acting work with drafting and redrafting her adaptation of Life of Pi Half of my creative life is always taken over by my life as a mother wrote Chakrabarti My kids need structure and order their daughters are now 18 and 20 years old which seem in direct opposition to a freelance life sometimes it seems like an impossible task She was simultaneously working on a multidisciplinary adaptation of Italo Calvinos fantastical travelogue Invisible Cities premiered at the Manchester international festival in 2019 and a yettobereleased film version of her own hit play Red Velvet with Lester reprising the role of the African American actor Ira Aldridge who caused a storm in 1833 when he took over from Edmund Kean in a West End production of Othello She recalled redrafting the screenplay with notes Lester had given her He always looks at my writing with an actors eye but also a directors one she wrote Its very useful because I come from an emotional logic rather than a visual one With so many competing demands on her time how does she primarily see herself Ive always said Im an actor first and then a writer but this last year because I havent managed to fit in much acting Ive been sort of begrudgingly saying Im a writer and an actor because the writing has come to me more easily OFarrell accepting the Womens prize for fiction 2020 for Hamnet Photograph David M BenettDave BenettGetty Images for The Green Room Agency This is partly the timeold issue of age When she was in her 20s an older actor warned her that 3050 was very hard for women in the theatre That was like half of my life ahead of me And she was right actually I think things have changed in the past four or five years But before that people didnt really know what to do with women and then people of colour that was a whole other thing Six years ago she played her first Shakespearean mother  Gertrude  to Tom Hiddlestons Hamlet in a production that was one of 2017s hottest tickets staged by Kenneth Branagh to raise money for their alma mater Rada Shes 53 now I feel really lucky Im getting to tell some stories that I want to tell And I get to put women on stage I think Im secretly writing for my 30 to 50yearold self she says These are not career anxieties that afflict a novelist and memoirist such as OFarrell whose reputation has been growing with every novel You know its funny people often ask you about your career And I always think what career she says I think if you are attracted to being a writer youre not the kind of person who thinks that you have a career at all Ive always felt that the best book youre going to write is the one you cant not write  the one thats the one thats calling to you and tugging at your sleeve most insistently Though Hamnet is now also being made into a film  details of which she is forbidden to reveal  she has never considered diversifying into scriptwriting As a novelist Im asking a reader to follow me through a forest a bit like Hansel and Gretel and I know how to leave a trail of visible breadcrumbs for the novel But I wouldnt know how to do that for an audience I just dont have those muscles Watching rehearsals for the play had given her a new understanding of the significance of the term playwright she adds Its the same root as the word wheelwright you know this old fashioned work of making and creating something There was this room full of people at the top of their game not just actors but lighting and movement and costume specialists What fascinated me is the idea that it was a kind of callandresponse process The play was being wrought right in front of us It gives an insight into what Shakespeare himself did He had an incredible company the Lord Chamberlains Men or the Kings Men and they wrote the plays together Seeing that echoed in what Lolita and Erica Whyman the director and everybody else was doing was very moving As Chakrabarti enters the final frenzy of bringing Agnes to life on stage OFarrell has retreated to her medicinal herb garden In fact I was clearing it out over the weekend and thinking what am I going to grow this year Because obviously its been very much in abeyance over the winter she says All your characters are part of you in a way so is Agnes still with me Definitely And I hope she always will be

architect of Thatchers radical economic reformsAt the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was ,At the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was immediately interpreted by the more perceptive political analysts  13134 chars,At the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was immediately interpreted by the more perceptive political analysts as the beginning of the end of the Thatcher years And so it proved The man whom Margaret Thatcher once called my golden boy the politician who was credited as the main architect of her governments economic success had lit a touchpaper that would smoulder across the months and lead to her ignominious departure a little more than a year later The specific cause of Lawsons resignation was a spat over the prime ministers employment of an independent economic adviser Alan Walters whose views on the then European monetary system EMS chimed with hers but differed from those of the chancellor who sought to use foreign exchange rates rather than interest rates to achieve economic stability At root Thatcher had become increasingly suspicious of Lawson since the credit for the Conservatives 1987 election victory had been attributed to the success of Treasury policy and she feared a loss of political authority if she dismissed Walters Nigel Lawson and Margaret Thatcher at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool 1983 She called him my golden boy Photograph Denis ThorpeThe Guardian One of the letters Lawson received after his resignation was from the former deputy prime minister Lord Willie Whitelaw who commented that Thatcher could not bear to be on the losing side of any argument and added That failing may ditch us all Lawson had taken office as chancellor in 1983 only nine years after his first election to parliament and on resignation was the longest serving in that post since David Lloyd George a record later eclipsed by Gordon Brown He had joined the government as financial secretary to the Treasury when Thatcher formed her first government in 1979 and had already made his mark in that post by abolishing exchange control doubling VAT and introducing the Medium Term Financial Strategy As a radical taxreforming chancellor in pursuit of monetarist policies alongside a massive programme of privatisation and deregulation that helped emasculate the trade union movement he won praise but not popularity respect but not regard from his Conservative colleagues It mattered little to him His fierce intellectual approach to all aspects of policy meant that he always gave a higher priority to achieving his aims than to what others thought His indifference to opposing points of view was often interpreted as arrogance but in reality his personal convictions were such that he was simply not prepared to submit himself to what he saw as the indignities his fellow politicians endured in pursuit of public approbation Nigel Lawson with his daughter the cook and writer Nigella Lawson in 2004 Photograph Richard YoungShutterstock A popular chancellor is not doing his job he said once He believed that a politician who was confident enough to be able to face a barrage of hostility was someone who could make things happen In this regard he had much in common with Thatcher She admired him once calling him brilliant three times in five minutes He in turn admired her readiness to push forward the boundaries of what was politically possible and also shared much of her vision He recognised her political skills and saw how she was able to extend her empathy with the Conservative party to embrace the silent majority of the electorate But he himself was a loner he did not cultivate political friends and he had no clique of supporters or acolytes even at the peak of his political authority in late 1987 There was a rumour that the prime minister was considering moving him to the Foreign Office but nothing came of it His name was infrequently included in lists of potential future party leaders He came into politics as the MP for Blaby in Leicestershire at a relatively late age in February 1974 just before his 42nd birthday But by then he had already had a successful career in journalism and had much experience in politics It seemed that running the Treasury was the summit of his ambition In his maiden speech in the Commons on 1 April 1974 speaking on that years budget he attacked the new Labour chancellor Denis Healey for embarking on a social contract with the trade unions instead of limiting union power in order to control wage inflation Thatcher was impressed She was elected Tory leader in 1975 He was on the frontbench the following year as a whip and appointed as a Treasury spokesman a year later He became a close adviser to Thatcher on the strategy she should pursue His course was set Nigel Lawson at Chatham House central London speaking in his role a chair of the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 Photograph Dan KitwoodGetty Images He had been born into a middleclass Jewish family a household that supported a nanny cook and parlourmaid in Hampstead north London His father Ralph was a commodities broker specialising in tea and his mother Joan nee Davis the daughter of a stockbroker The pianist Dame Myra Hess was a greataunt His paternal grandfather Gustav Leibson who was born in Latvia and escaped the east European Jewish purges of the early 20th century prospered in London sufficiently to send Ralph to Westminster school and changed the family name to Lawson in 1925 Nigel spent his early school years dodging the London blitz  he went to seven different primary schools  before following his father to Westminster He would often describe himself as suffering from laziness but this had no impact on his academic life He won a maths scholarship to Christ Church Oxford where he took a first in philosophy politics and economics His university years were spent partying and playing poker He skied fenced and acted and had nothing to do with politics He did national service for two years in the Royal Navy from 1954 and promoted to lieutenantcommander took command of HMS Gay Charger He was turned down for a career by the Foreign Office in 1956 and instead decided on journalism joining the Financial Times He became city editor of the Sunday Telegraph in 1960 In 1963 his political career began He was recruited by Conservative central office to help the ailing Harold Macmillan with speechwriting and thereafter continued working for his successor Sir Alec DouglasHome through the 1964 election After that I felt I ought to get out on the field and play he wrote later He tried for a series of parliamentary seats before eventually securing selection for the Labour marginal Eton and Slough in 1968 He lost to the popular Labour politician Joan Lestor in 1970 and then in 1972 was triumphantly selected for Blaby from a list of 170 candidates He had turned down the opportunity to become director of the Conservative research department in 1964 and instead returned to journalism first as a columnist at the FT and then in 1966 as editor of the Spectator Under his editorship the magazine took a surprisingly liberal line most notably on the Vietnam war In a signed article Lawson wrote The risks involved in an American withdrawal from Vietnam are less than the risks in escalating a bloody and brutal war He was fired while fighting the 1970 election by his then proprietor Harry Creighton who wanted more personal control of the magazine Now an established journalist Lawson had plenty of work and political interests to pursue In 1972 he became a research fellow at Nuffield College Oxford which led to the publication of a book The Power Game jointly written with Jock BruceGardyne on power and decisionmaking Its conclusions included the proposition that so often it is pure hazard which tips the scale of decision in the end In 1973 he returned to Conservative central office and wrote the crisis package of the partys manifesto for the February 1974 Who Governs Britain election  lost by Edward Heath because of the miners strike and the threeday week Lawson believed that Heath could easily have won the election if he had decided to call it earlier At Westminster Lawson a man who always kept his watch five minutes fast was an early star despite his uncompromising approach He knew what he thought was right and pursued political solutions to that end His instincts were rightwing but could be egalitarian for example supporting the RookerWise amendment in 1977 on inflationproofing income tax allowances helping two Labour backbenchers prevail against their own government Once in government himself he kept a distance from his cabinet colleagues but there was always a plan During his two years as energy secretary from 1981 the only job he held outside the Treasury it was Lawson who was responsible for building up the coal stocks at power stations that would enable Thatcher to confront the striking miners and bring Arthur Scargill to his knees and the coalmining industry effectively to its end By the late 1980s however although his own political star was in its ascendancy and he had created the circumstances that led to the socalled Lawson boom there was growing disquiet within the cabinet The atmosphere of public optimism Lawson was delighted to believe he had created was in contrast to the private antagonism among his colleagues He himself was an implacable opponent of the poll tax which he regarded as absurd but he angered some of his colleagues by failing to help alleviate the impact of the tax having apparently decided that it could not be rescued He and Geoffrey Howe the foreign secretary whom Thatcher demoted in the summer of 1989 had both angered the prime minister with their views on the EMS which they supported and she did not Although Thatcher had repeatedly described Lawsons position as unassailable  even after he had resigned  she managed to fulfil the words of a French saying of which Lawson was particularly fond as a political lodestar It was Tout sarrange mais mal Everything will work out but badly Walters resigned as well And Thatchers authority did begin to look under question After his resignation Lawson opined that Thatcher had become an electoral liability He bitterly resented that what he termed the No 10 black propaganda machine blamed him for all the governments problems and later in a book of memoirs The View from No 11 1992 a majestic overview of the economy under his stewardship was specifically critical of Thatchers loyal press secretary Bernard Ingham He tried unsuccessfully to persuade Howe to stand in the leadership election that followed Thatchers fall finally precipitated by Howe in November 1990 Lawson publicly backed Michael Heseltine in that contest Nigel Lawson outside the House of Lords in 2011 He managed to lose five stone and wrote a book about it Photograph Heathcliff OMalleyShutterstock In retirement Lawson was honest in acknowledging mistakes such as announcing the end of mortgage interest rates before the policy came into force thus overheating the housing market He also said that he should have tightened monetary policy earlier and admitted that the big bang deregulation of Londons financial markets inadvertently led to the financial crisis of 200708 Even though he was not a charismatic orator he always spoke succinctly as for example when challenging from the backbenches yet another consultation on what to do about the poll tax he recalled the words of the French politician Pierre Mends France who once said that to govern was to choose I agree with that said Lawson To appear to be unable to choose is to appear to be unable to govern His main interest however was a campaign to counter the case for global heating He set up a thinktank the Global Warming Policy Foundation designed to challenge international attempts to mitigate the impacts of global heating Lawson claimed that economic growth should not be slowed down to prevent a possible eventuality but that policy should be made pragmatically in response to what had already happened He also accepted a post as president of Conservatives for Britain to campaign in favour of Britain leaving Europe Lawson had become plump during the course of his career but lost about 30 kilos 5st in the year after his resignation and wrote The Nigel Lawson Diet Book 1996 in which he reported that he had resolved that dieting would be his retirement job After stepping down from his parliamentary seat in 1992 he was made a peer and for many years he divided his time between attending the Lords and a home in Gascony in France Lawson was married twice and had six children three of whom were named after him five survive him In 1955 he married Vanessa Salmon the daughter of the J Lyons Corner House dynasty and they had four children Dominic Nigella Thomasina who died in 1993 and Horatia The marriage ended in divorce in 1980 and later that year Lawson married Thrse Maclear a former member of the Commons Library staff with whom he had two children Tom and Emily The couple divorced in 2012 Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby politician and journalist born 11 March 1932 died 3 April 2023

I went home and I was like I didnt get the solo My mom looked at me and said Are you the best I said Yes I am Then she said Give me a pen and paper Nakhanes mother wrote to the school and demanded that her child be cast in the lead or else they quit Long story short  I got the solo Recounting the memory two things are apparent to Nakhane While it was great for them to have that much selfbelief they realise it should have been an opportunity for them to learn how to take a fucking loss Now aged 35 and living in south London the singer songwriter novelist and actor is working to temper their inner competitiveness I can get ugly they say showing me the wrist fracture they got from playing rugby with some jocks during the second lockdown It doesnt matter what it is  its life or death I have to win they say with a laugh Everyones going to forget about it in 20 minutes but Im not The next time I see you Im going to remember that you beat me These kinds of anecdotes embody Nakhanes tenacity Over the last 10 years and after overcoming obstacles such as conversion therapy and death threats they have become one of South Africas biggest music artists whose fans include Madonna Elton John and former collaborator Anohni I could never just be That was never enough Im trying to come to terms with the idea that Im lovable We are meeting today to discuss Nakhanes third album Bastard Jargon a pop disco and funkladen record signalling yet another departure for the multifaceted artist Nakhane is wearing a blue bomber with high cheekbones contoured sharp enough to kill someone They exude a soothingly selfaware disposition and a dry humour that is as entertaining as it is enlightening Bastard Jargon features the likes of Perfume Genius on the hedonistic synthfilled Do You Well and Nile Rodgers who Nakhane says was a joy to work alongside Sometimes you can work with people and be tuned to believing that their way is the way but Rodgers was like Hey Im here to help you find your vision Its your album You have to live with it for the rest of your life Nakhanes need to be the best isnt simply about egotism  that much is obvious within minutes of meeting them Ive always been trying to perform exceptionality because my biological parents were not into the idea of having me Nakhane was raised by their grandmother and later adopted by their aunt and her husband at age seven My understanding was that you got chosen to be adopted because you were exceptional they say I was always praised for being clever and talented After years of therapy I realised that I could never just be That was never enough Now Im trying to come to terms with the idea that Im lovable just being Nakhane Mahlakahlaka was born in 1988 and raised in a fundamental Christian rural town in South Africas Eastern Cape They were academically adept but it was always obvious that they were creatively inclined My father wanted me to be a chartered accountant or a lawyer I said No I want to be an artist Nakhane moved to Johannesburg aged 17 and began performing in Cape Towns open mic scene In 2013 they released their debut Brave Confusion an acoustic guitarheavy record that won best alternative album at the South African Music awards Two years later they made a track with South African house legend DJ Black Coffee called We Dance Again It became an instant club hit It was massive The expectation was that I would carry on making house music There was this disappointment about the fact that I didnt I took that in a little bit But also I liked the idea of being oppositional they say with a laugh Nakhane on stage at Londons Purcell Room as part of Nile Rodgerss Meltdown 2019 Photograph Burak ngRedferns Instead in 2018 they released the tender sophomore album You Will Not Die featuring songs that Nakhane describes as devastating It showcased their operatic vocals on ballads containing intimate storytelling that explored their experience of leaving Christianity behind When Nakhane was 19 they came out as gay but after feeling shame about their sexuality underwent conversion therapy At the time when I went into the church I was strangely enough leaning into my queerness but I had all of this conditioning as a child about how it was a sin and how I was going to go to hell So when someone told me I should go to the church it touched on all those things I was already so scared of I wanted so badly to go to heaven When Nakhane eventually left the church the journey to their true self wasnt as simple as they had imagined I thought it was going to feel so free I felt unhinged I felt like I had nothing holding me because that was the thing that held every facet of my life The question was who are you I had to start almost over from scratch The aftermath of the conversion therapy is something Nakhane is still dealing with today Recently they were watching a TV series about a Christian cult and something clicked they began noticing the similarities between the show and their own experiences My closest friends  I was told over and over again to let go of them in the church Thats what they do right Isolate you from those people so that you only depend on them completely Maybe this was a cult Gender is big wide old and ancient Theres nothing new about it Theres nothing perverse about it Organised religion is no longer of interest to them If your only tool is fear youve lost me but spirituality still is Everyone has a right to God or whatever you want to call it How dare you think that you own God Im sure God is thinking Im so much bigger than this Im not this boring Since those dark times Nakhane is getting closer and closer to their truest self They came out as nonbinary in 2021 an experience they say felt like unlocking a door Gender is big wide old and ancient Theres nothing new about it Theres nothing perverse about it In addition to music they have also tried their hand at other art forms in 2015 they released Piggy Boys Blues a novel about a Xhosa the second largest cultural group in South Africa royal family and in 2017 starred in John Trengoves The Wound Despite favourable reviews the film received a backlash from those back home in South Africa and in the Xhosa community for interlacing ulwaluko the secret rite of passage into manhood observed by the Xhosa tribe with homosexual scenes Nakhane received death threats on the films release which prompted their move to London When they arrived they had expected London to be a volcano of sensation but instead found it anticlimactic The queer scene in Johannesburg is much more exhilarating Theres a sense of experimentation that doesnt exist here They consider London home now but also see the UK as a place that refuses to reconcile with its history and its current state When I lived in Port Elizabeth it was a British colony British culture was something we learned all the time how much better it was they say But I do not aspire to whiteness or European culture What I have been given in South Africa is so fulfilling Still they want to stress that they love living here Ill tell you why You know that old painting that you always wanted to see You can go and see it The band that would never come to Africa You can go and see them here Bastard Jargon is the light at the end of the tunnel in many ways Its about sex morality politics and identity but its also a project of joy embarking on a new sonic and stylistic journey The process of creating the album was different too Instead of writing to chords I would layer drums first It was this sense of a new beginning Lead single Tell Me Your Politik featuring Nile Rodgers and Moonchild Sanelly is uptempo hyperpercussive and features South African gqom and kwaito Nakhane had known since 2013 that they wanted to make a rhythmic dance album but it wasnt until touring wrapped for You Will Not Die that the timing felt right That album was based on so much trauma I just couldnt make that kind of music any more I was exhausted from singing sad songs The only way I was going to be creative again was if I swung to the other side Theres a level of stubbornness an artist must have in order to be great according to Nakhane who cites Erykah Badu Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye as people who always followed their hearts Shabaka Hutchings who announced on Instagram that 2023 would be his last year of performing publicly Am I mad that he is putting down the saxophone Hell yes But if thats what he needs to do who am I to argue The idea of success is forever shifting for Nakhane Theyre not interested in accumulating excessive wealth because do we need any more billionaires Still there was a time when their selfesteem was attached to quantifiable things like money and fans They are learning to let those kinds of ideals go I want to be able to pay my rent I want to be able to go on holiday I want to be able to have a cup of coffee but I always try to remind myself I dont want to be a superrich artist Ive never seen one who makes anything worth noting Bastard Jargon is an opportunity for Nakhane to reach new heights and audiences This existential sex album leans more toward pop than past projects but its also their loudest and most queer I always have to remind people  you know those queer people that are in your face and that you think are too much Im just like them Im not any better Im never going to be a wellbehaved token One thing they know for certain is that they no longer want to compete with people who look like them I had a conversation with myself that I shouldnt compete with other people particularly Black artists particularly Black artists from South Africa I dont want to be the only Black queer person in the room I want us all to be there

loftier things What makes Ben Schwartz different is that even as his Tinseltown career rockets  he is in Apple TVs The Afterparty and the forthcoming NicolasCageasDracula movie Renfield and is the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog  he just wont leave his muchmaligned first love behind With the specials and with this tour says Schwartz the goal is to show that improv is fun exciting and freeing That like standup it can be done successfully in front of thousands of people Those Netflix specials under the banner Middleditch  Schwartz are three fantastic longform improv shows not sketches but a whole hourlong story performed with his occasional sidekick Thomas Middleditch It is the streaming platforms first experiment with live improv The tour is Ben Schwartz  Friends which has been circulating North America in the rare gaps between the 41yearolds acting work and is coming to London I cant tell you how excited I am to get on that stage in England and do a show says Schwartz his motormouth positivity buzzing across the transatlantic Zoom line Netflix said Whats going to happen on stage And we said We dont know Schwartz started out as a dogsbody at the NYC improv club Upright Citizens Brigade UCB paying with his labour for access to the work of Poehler Tina Fey and co Soon improvising himself he carved a niche with sketches and contributions to the Funny or Die platform and the web series Jake  Amir Since the beginning he says I was always like Im going to find a way to do this I tried everything I freelanced writing for David Letterman I freelanced for SNL I did commercials I tried standup I tried everything hoping something would stick and I could be in this industry I loved Aged 29 he sealed the deal when cast alongside Aziz Ansari as the unjustifiably cocky JeanRalphio on Poehlers hit sitcom Parks and Recreation It was a careermaking turn  but it didnt break Schwartzs bond with improv OK so making up comedy on the hoof pays zero dollars and is afforded nearzero credibility in the entertainment landscape Any time I tell people I do improv says Schwartz their only reference is their friends class shows at college And my class shows were horrific I didnt know what I was doing So I think peoples perception is based on watching performers starting out who havent put the hours in They have nothing to point to like a special from anybody to say Look how good this can be Watch the trailer for the improvised Netflix specials Middleditch  Schwartz Thats where Middleditch  Schwartz comes in although even that was a hard sell Netflix said Whats going to happen on stage And we said We dont know They said But youll have an idea And we said We dont have anything What persuaded the channel was Schwartzs rising stardom and the novel commercial argument that whereas standups take a year to develop each set every time we do a show says Schwartz its a new special I can give you two new specials every day We filmed for one weekend and Netflix got three pieces of hourlong content With his new tour Schwartz continues the same crusade redeeming the reputation of improv for delirious thousandsstrong audiences One of his tricks is to dragoon celeb pals  improv virgins all  into taking part Don Cheadle JJ Abrams Stranger Things Joe Keery  I just want to share it with them And then watching the audience watching these people do it for the first time thats such a fun thing Its all about the fun for Schwartz Improv doesnt pay like the other things but its the thing that makes me happiest I can imagine his agent pulling out their hair that their hotproperty client keeps disappearing off on improv tours Watch Schwartz as JohnRalphio in Parks and Recreation I film MondaytoFriday get on the plane do my shows on Saturday and by the time Monday rolls around Im acting again Im so tired But in a million years I couldnt have thought Id have done any of this says the selfdefined little Jewish guy from the Bronx who is starring  well voiceacting  alongside his childhood hero Jim Carrey in the Sonic the Hedgehog films But let me tell you a fun story he says I was interning at UCB way back when to pay for classes I did the garbage I gave people their tickets And at the end of the show after everybody had gone and wed cleaned the theatre me and my friends Adam Pally and Gil Ozeri later the sketch group Hot Sauce would ask the manager Can we just get on stage for 10 minutes right now And so wed go on stage in the dark and do shows for nobody And we would make each other laugh and laugh And those are some of my fondest memories I get emotional thinking about it Improv is playtime for me And Ill keep doing it until people dont want me to do it any more

Guy Garvey with whom she has a sixyearold son How are preparations for Private Lives They are full of joy It is one of the most pleasurable parts to play and story to tell  this very passionate narcissistic combustive dangerous costly and hilarious relationship And to be able to do it in the Donmar where no audience member is more than four rows away They are in your armpit they can smell the sweat and see up your nostrils so youve got to be on your game or you will be exposed The Observers 1930 review of the original production noted that the play could not stand up to the slightest clumsiness in the acting Do you agree Yes I do You have to have two actors who trust each other totally and who arent playing stupid fucking ego games outside of the stupid fucking ego games that their characters are playing Otherwise youd have just too many explosions going on Guy and my son will just improvise songs or gags Its made me less afraid of constantly coming up with daft shit So its a nightmare being paired with Stephen Mangan Laughs Steve Mangan is just the dream There are many actors whose balls you have to cup in order to be able to More laughter If you have a funnier line you have to sort of soften the blow But not this man this man can stand up to anything How does your version differ from other revivals Were doing the grittiest version of it Weve got some proper

went to go and work in a pub for a bit And do some peoplewatching and clean up some sick It was very grounding Did the break make you appreciate acting When I was much younger I was sent off for auditions for a Bond movie Casino Royale And I just remember I thought This is not me I dont feel like a Bond girl This is awful I found myself being told what it was I ought to want and it was never

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/apr/04/chris-brownridge-behind-the-wheel-of-a-greener-image-for-bmw,Chris Brownridge behind the wheel of a greener image for BMW,The chief exec of the German marques UK arm grew up a petrolhead but says hes now more fired up about electric cars and finding sustainable ways to make themWhen as a child in the 1980s Chris Brownridge first admired his grandfathers BMW saloon the bu,When as a child in the 1980s Chris Brownridge first admired his grandfathers BMW saloon the business of selling cars was a fairly straightforward exchange of cash for a vehicle But when he joined 6635 chars,When as a child in the 1980s Chris Brownridge first admired his grandfathers BMW saloon the business of selling cars was a fairly straightforward exchange of cash for a vehicle But when he joined the industry in the 1990s it was in the middle of a wave of change Readily available car finance suddenly meant the public could buy more expensive cars It changed the type of car people bought says Brownridge chief executive of BMW Group UK Drivers could borrow to buy a pricier vehicle in the expectation that it would hold its value and could be sold on later Britons couldnt get enough of it low interest rates helped and BMW rose to become the UKs fourthbiggest seller of cars despite the premium price tag of most of its models And now the industry is facing an even bigger paradigm shift with the transition to electric cars in full swing and newer innovations such as connected and autonomous cars opening the door to different kinds of business Things have changed a lot and are about to change significantly again says Brownridge standing in BMWs flagship showroom on Londons Park Lane I genuinely think we are on the edge of probably the most exciting time in the industry Brownridge is a UK car industry lifer He was born in Oxford  close to the Mini factory which BMW now owns  but when he was small his family moved to Hong Kong so his engineer father could work on the citys mass transit system Ive very fond memories of a very different culture Brownridge says It was a very different world with the UK ruling the city state until the handover in 1997 When Chris Patten last governor of Hong Kong left on the royal yacht Britannia with the then Prince Charles it was quite a sad moment really However his family was always tied to the UK and he returned for his secondary education After university the car industry was the obvious choice I am fascinated by anything with wheels he says It felt very natural to start work with Land Rover then under the Rover Group which was in turn owned by BMW He worked in managing customer relationships and data at Mini Rover and MG Brownridge rose through the BMW ranks via marketing roles overseeing sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympics theres a replica Olympic torch in the corner of the room before taking charge of the Mini brand He became UK chief executive in 2021 overseeing BMWs fourthlargest market after China the US and Germany BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Traditionally carmakers would sell cars to dealers and the dealers handled customer relationships but now manufacturers increasingly sell direct to consumers online Dealers are highly sensitive about suggestions of a changing business model  under which carmakers take more control of the customer relationship  and Brownridge is wary of giving details of what BMW is considering Our longterm strategy is to work with our network of retailers he says emphasising the with However he acknowledges that how we transact is being examined Thats something we need to work on with our partners rather than inflict on them he says Because ultimately our success is mutual Being more involved in the customer relationship will give carmakers more opportunities to make money throughout a vehicles life Carmakers say they will also make their products more attractive Customers are not always happy about being asked to pay more after purchase however BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Brownridge says some of the coverage that focused on the hardware aspect was overlooking the obvious opportunity for software upgrades that can improve drivers experience But the most eyecatching change to the car industry is the shift to electric technology BMW made one in every 10 batterypowered cars sold in the UK in 2022 and a fifth of its UK sales were battery electric  already putting it on track to meet the governments mandate of 22 battery sales by 2024 which was confirmed last week after this interview took place Carmakers will need to be selling 80 battery vehicles by 2030 and 100 by 2035 The government needs to ensure there is enough green energy to power electric cars and put more investment into the UKs charging network BMW has not always been on board with the UK governments plans In 2020 it and other carmakers argued that a ban on internal combustion engines before 2040 would damage the British industry Asked about that stance Brownridge says the UK governments plans are ambitious  not usually a compliment from executives  but achievable for BMW at least amid very strong demand for electric cars Were ready he says We have the products So we are able to respond However he adds that the government needs to ensure there is enough green energy available to power electric cars and must put more investment into the UKs charging network Brownridge says car buyers focus on sustainability will only increase and will soon extend beyond the fuel powering their cars to how the cars are made A focus on greener materials might give premium carmakers an edge as their higher margins can soak up new costs But the BMW boss cites a company visit to a coalmine west of Cologne in Germany as evidence for why green manufacturing will become increasingly important to carmakers The giant Hambach coalmine is bigger than central London in area and Brownridge says a giant machine there scoops out enough coal every day to cover a football field to a height of almost 100 metres You look at that and think well this cant continue because therell be nothing left he says Customer choice will be heavily influenced by their understanding of the same sustainability for the products I think thats quite exciting CV Age 48 Family Married to Ami for 23 years with two

Carraways black comedy as if to borrow one of many visceral images from it it were a coffeecolonic induced poo thrown at me Rain Dogs comedy is so black at first it seems to obliterate any possibility of light or warmth The stark opposite of funny Despairinducing in fact However just as I urge you to stick with this nasty brutish series please read on We meet Daisy May Coopers Costello Jones  sober 99 days  as shes being evicted from her council flat with her daughter Iris Episode one sees her go on a desperate hunt around London to find them a bed for the night They try to sleep in a launderette They break into a friends car so Iris can attempt her homework Finally they take the last available option inevitably the most dangerous one and bed down in the cupboard of a pervert pervert is a word that comes up a lot in Rain Dogs Also nonce And whore He makes Costello put on a pink satin nightie and tells her not to worry because shes not fat shes just got a food bank body Shes rescued by best friend Florian Selby a filthy rich entitled selfannihilating classical homosexual with strong Withnail vibes whos just been released from prison The halfhour of hijinks ends with them breaking into Costellos old flat right back where they started See what I mean about despairinducing But I keep watching and my ear starts to tune into the bracingly strong cadences of Carraways Bukowskian voice Beneath the ballast of shock violence and bawdy language shes quietly skewering the grotesque realities of class and sex inequality like virtually no one else Its writing that pushes you to the edge then holds your head over it so you can see how things really are It takes a little time to adjust to the high altitude By the end of the second episode Im acclimatised Fully invested in the resilience and brilliance of Costello Selbys razor wit his monstrous mother Allegra Anna Chancellor on killer form and the glorious Gloria Ronke Adekoluejo who works in her dads funeral parlour where shes been known to take the occasional selfie with a hot dead guy By the time Gloria is describing the four whores of the apocalypse to Iris as Moll Flanders official whore Divine Brown iconic whore Julia Roberts made every girl want to be one And Billie Piper ITV whore I am laughing my head off As would Piper and Lucy Prebble as Rain Dogs shares some of the brutal surreal horror of their show I Hate Suzie Cooper as no one who saw her in This Country will be surprised to hear is magnificent Her Costello is defiant broken authentic and a master of saying all that can never be said with the tiniest downturn of her mouth No wonder shes being touted as the next M in James Bond I can totally see it Theres a scene in which she goes to clean the house of an incurably ill painter  and yes pervert  Adrian Edmondson in vintage Bottom mode whos been banned from the 2 peep show where she works for reasons you can imagine As she polishes a glass table with a series of highpitched squeaks he finishes himself off Afterwards Costello pops his oxygen mask back on for him takes her cash and says with warmth and sarcasm Its an awful life we live but we do it with such dignity Lots happens fast Costello is propositioned by a journalist while dancing at the peep show and urged to tell her story She dreams of being a writer so says yes Of course shes screwed over and ends up shagging the photographer a poverty voyeur whom she whispers to in bed You feel like Louis Theroux on one of his weird weekends dont you Carraways writing about class is genius Costello Selby and Iris run away to the country and pretend to be a functional rich family as if such a thing exists It ends in a punchup and purgatory for them all a rehab unit for Selby and for Costello and for Iris a womens refuge where the only rule is we lay low and let the lord guide us Dear god Iris Fleur Tashjian though is too fundamentally sweet and unscarred considering what shes been through Even with a mother as loving as Costello she would be a mess Eventually  for the revelations come in a slow dripdrip in Rain Dogs  we see why Costello is as she is She goes home for the first time in 15 years Its a painful incomplete and beautifully controlled scene from the delay in her mum coming down to see her because shes just dropped a bath bomb to the arrival of her awful brother who insists shes an impostor Why would I want this life Costello says with a mirthless laugh That is a life shaped by abuse Rain Dogs is not really a comedy at all Its a bleak and beautiful drama in which the rare laughs are a matter

home And Elias Jahshans mother sends him a homebaked care package every year Maamoul is a semolinabased biscuit stuffed with a variety of fillings  usually dates pistachios or walnuts  often dusted with icing sugar Its served in many Levantine cultures around the festive seasons  including Easter or Eid alFitr which fall just two weeks apart this year Maamoul moulds for different faiths the moulds come in different patterns and shapes with particular meanings They can also be used to denote different fillings Photograph Luisa Brimble Nader says maamoul takes her back to her mothers kitchen the smell of rosewater and icing sugar She has saved all of her late mothers moulds knowing that good ones are now hard to come by I found my own after a yearslong search prompting a deluge of messages from people asking where they can get some too I remember teaching my religion classes about the reason that maamoul is the Easter biscuit Nader says The shape is the tomb of Christ and the sweetness of the resurrection is hidden until Christ broke through death Maamoul is so beloved by the communities who make it its mere mention can be transportive  a portal back in time Jahshan who says hes not that religious appreciates the biscuits that arrive to his London home even knowing the contents will be crumbled or crusty from their journey For mother and daughter Sivine Tabbouch and Karima Chloe Hazim maamoul runs through their blood Traditionally maamoul is made in generous quantities as they are shared with friends and family Photograph Luisa Brimble These days they run Lebanese cooking school Sunday Kitchen together But when Hazim was little they made kilos of biscuits to give to relatives friends and neighbours at Eid alFitr  the celebration which ends the monthlong Ramadan fast When you make it at home its a very sensory experience Hazim says Youre using your hands youre tapping on a wooden mould  and then theres the aroma the sight of them piled high on the table after theyve come out of the oven Serena Tajjour who runs her mothers bakery Smd Al Maamoul on Instagram says they have been flat out due to the close proximity of festivities this year Now at capacity theyve had to add a disclaimer to notify customers that if any spare boxes of maamoul become available this information will be posted on Instagram We are nervous Im not going to lie Tajjour says We were booked out early for Easter and Eid early last year This year we planned to be more prepared but we are a little overwhelmed Maamoul is a labour of love The bakery experiments with twists on the traditional maamoul much like Lebanese pastry chef Phil Khoury who offers a plantbased alternative to the recipe in his forthcoming book A New Way to Bake Maamoul he says is a commonality in a region often divided over faith ideology and politics In my immediate family maamoul were served around Easter he says Then I went to Lebanon and saw them served for Ramadan Now I live in London and have also seen Jews share these at Purim Every religious group in the Middle East celebrates something around roughly the same time with these filled biscuits Great maamoul according to Tabbouch comes down to highquality ingredients  the best ghee you can find the freshest nuts and no shortcuts The semolina drinks the butter while it rests she says Hazim suggests it is best made in groups so everyone has a distinct role kneading moulding baking I think there is something in how maamoul bridges a huge geographical divide via family and cultural tradition Jahshan says It invokes a sense of home and nostalgia with the love language of food When Roumieh published her short story on the sweets I wanted to write about something special to me she says but also something

quantity of pistachiofilled and walnutfilled maamoul as the dough is the same Sunday Kitchens maamoul do not dust with icing sugar until youre ready to serve them Photograph Luisa Brimble For the dough 1 cup milk 1 sachets instant yeast 1kg fine semolina 1kg coarse semolina 1 cup white sugar 875g of goodquality unsalted butter cubed and softened slightly in the microwave 1 sachet mahlab a fragrant spice made from pulverised cherry pits available from Lebanese grocery stores  cup rosewater  cup orange blossom water Icing sugar for dusting For the pistachio filling use an oval wooden mould kg raw pistachios shelled 1 cup sugar  cup orange blossom water For the walnut filling use a round wooden mould  kg raw walnuts 1 cup sugar  cup orange blossom water To make the dough you will need a very large mixing bowl large enough to fit your arms in as you will need to mix and knead the dough by hand In a small saucepan warm the milk over low heat until just warmer than skin temperature Remove from the heat and add the yeast then allow the pan to stand for a few minutes In the large mixing bowl add both the semolinas sugar and softened butter followed by the rosewater orange blossom water and mahlab then the milk and yeast mixture Using your hands rub the butter into the semolina while thoroughly combining and kneading all the ingredients together to form a soft wellincorporated dough The aim is to form a soft round ball with filling inside to place into your mould Photograph Luisa Brimble Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and set aside to rest in a cool dry place for four hours Meanwhile make the fillings For the pistachio filling place the pistachios sugar and orange blossom water in a food processor and crush for a few seconds or until you have broken down the nuts and incorporated them with the water It should be a textured crumb rather than a finely ground mixture For the walnut filling repeat the process with the walnuts sugar and orange blossom water Once your dough has rested for four hours preheat your oven to 180C fan or 200C conventional Line a few baking trays with baking paper As you shape and fill the maamoul you will need to knead the dough in the bowl to loosen the mixture so it fits well into your moulds To make a maamoul roll a small handful of dough roughly 40g into a ball and place it in the palm of your hand Place your index finger in the ball and work the sides of the dough against the palm of your hand rotating it as you go to form a hollow pocket Add a teaspoon of your chosen nut filling then seal the edges of the dough to completely enclose the filling The aim is to form a soft round ball with no leaking filling to place in your mould Dont be discouraged if your first is not perfect Photograph Luisa Brimble Press the ball into the patterned side of the mould flatten the top with your hand then gently bang the mould on your chopping board to release your maamoul Dont be discouraged if your first is not perfect  you will get better with each attempt Repeat until you have used all of your filling and dough There might be a little bit of one filling or the other left over Place your maamoul on the lined baking trays and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown Remove from the oven and allow to them to cool on the baking trays Do not handle the maamoul immediately as they will be very delicate while hot and will firm up after theyve cooled When the maamoul have cooled use a spatula or pastry scraper to gently remove them from the baking paper If eating immediately generously dust with icing sugar and serve If you wish to store and keep some maamoul for later do not dust these with icing sugar until you wish to serve them Undusted maamoul will keep for up to three months in an airtight container stored in a cool dry place or in the fridge

Cambridge will be the favourites to win aided not only by virtue of historical reput 4808 chars,Its hard to argue that University Challenge isnt elitist The quizshow relies upon the assumption that Oxford and Cambridge will be the favourites to win aided not only by virtue of historical reputation but by the fact that individual colleges are invited to enter thanks to an archaic entrance process devised in 1962 This creates a programme premised on class divides illustrated weekly by social media users who post the satirical image of Scumbag College sitting atop Footlights College Oxbridge in a 1984 episode of The Young Ones Professor of education Frank Coffield is calling for the programme to address this bias and has complained to the BBC regarding the weighted screen time given to Oxbridge students  given that these two universities constitute about a third of the teams competing Full disclosure  I am an alumna of Trinity College Cambridge and a former University Challenge contestant I also worked on the current series as a questions researcher and casting assistant But I agree with Coffield that there are too many Oxbridge teams I applied for the job to try to diversify the question subjects in the hope that this in turn would begin to change who applies to compete I no longer work on the programme but if University Challenge wants to remain relevant and representative of the UKs student body diversification must continue Limiting Oxford and Cambridge to one team each should be a part of that process The argument in favour of keeping the historic casting rules seems to be that having one team apiece for Oxford and Cambridge will render the competition a twohorse race of superteams Both would no doubt submit strong entries to the competition but in the pressure of the studio and under the fire of a changing set of questions no team is infallible While Oxbridge colleges have won 27 out of 51 series to date they have not taken the trophy since 2018 with Edinburgh Imperial College London and Warwick each defeating an Oxbridge team in the final since In 2022 Imperial were victorious over Reading the first final not to feature Oxbridge since 2013 The tide is turning This has been stimulated by the establishment of quizzing cultures in more nonOxbridge higher education institutions partly thanks to the outreach work of the University Challenge producers Yet this work is undermined by retaining the old application process whereby every Oxbridge college is invited to apply individually The result is that out of about 120 annual applications 70 come from Oxbridge these are then whittled down to 28 for the competition proper Jeremy Paxman with the 2013 University Of Manchester team Photograph BBCGranada MediaPA University Challenge was formulated six decades ago as a battle of wits along the lines of the OxfordCambridge boat race the nations best universities pitted head to head with a smattering of redbricks thrown in to shake things up But given that the mandate of University Challenge is to show a crosssection of the higher education system it is an absurdity to say that roughly a third of the UKs university makeup is represented by Oxbridge students The programme is produced by ITVs Lifted Entertainment owing to the ownership of format rights but since the programmes 1994 revival on BBC Two with Jeremy Paxman major decisions such as who hosts the show are the prerogative of the BBC as are the institutions they elect to feature We dont know if the rule allowing multiple Oxbridge colleges to apply was reconsidered by the production team after Paxmans exit from the series in favour of Amol Rajan this year But Oxbridge teams were invited to apply by college yet again The message that University Challenge continues to disseminate is that attending Oxbridge is the key to success Its notable too that all three hosts have been Cambridge alumni There are a multitude of factors that favour Oxbridge at this stage The invitation documentation landing on the desk of an administrator at an Oxford college of 700 students is far more likely to be taken further than in a university of 45000 Applying for the series is demanding involving selforganised tests and practice sessions which are far easier to manage in a small institution This is acknowledged by the producers and the initial stages are seeded such that Oxbridge colleges knock each other out early on Looking at the current series its worth observing that Oxford and Cambridge had four colleges each this year the lowest number to date only two of which  Newnham College and Jesus College Cambridge  have made it to the quarterfinals Ultimately its not an institution with its collective brainpower competing in

some of the worlds biggest producers agreed to cut production Here we explain what happened and what it might mean for inflation and interest rates Why are oil prices rising An oil refinery in Karbala Iraq Photograph AFPGetty Images The reason oil prices jumped by more than 7 in early London trading was that members of the Opec cartel agreed a surprise cut in production over the weekend The move led by Saudi Arabia will take effect next month and will reduce the supply of crude by more than 1m barrels a day All other things being equal limiting supply of oil leads to an increase in its price and that explains why a barrel of Brent crude  one of the benchmarks for the market  hit nearly 86 a barrel Why has Opec taken this step The King Abdullah financial district in Riyadh Saudi Arabia Photograph BloombergGetty Images This looks like a preemptive move from the cartel ahead of a likely economic slowdown  and possible recession in the US  later this year Opec said its decision was aimed at ensuring stability in the oil market by which it means putting a floor under oil prices of about 80 a barrel Even so the production cut represents a gamble that stronger demand from China  where the economy is recovering from its strict lockdown  will offset the dampening effect on demand in the west It is a sign of the cooling of relations between Washington and Riyadh that the Saudis went ahead with their voluntary production cut despite strong opposition from Joe Bidens administration Will higher prices stick Gas prices advertised at a Chevron station in Los Angeles California Photograph Lucy NicholsonReuters This is the 64m dollar question In the past Opec has announced production cuts and then failed to follow through on the commitments Traders will be looking closely for evidence of quota busting this time But even if there is no cheating todays surge in the oil price to the highest level since January will only stick if the global economy can shrug off the impact of dearer energy If it cant prices will come under downward pressure Ipek Ozkardeskaya senior analyst at Swissquote Bank says it is possible but hard for oil prices to reach 100 a barrel adding If the rising oil prices hit the global demand prospects at quite an uneasy time for the world economy due to the bank stress and further spurs recession worries there is a chance that the rally in oil

come at a worse time for the US the UK and the EU  all of which are battling to reduce upward pressure on the cost of living Although western economies are less oilintensive than they were when Opec first became a household name 50 years ago the cost of crude still matters Higher oil prices make production and transport more expensive and reduce the spending power of consumers Central banks have been expecting inflation to fall sharply this year on the grounds that there will be no repeat of last years increase in energy costs triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine The Opec move threatens to make the fall in inflation a more protracted affair What does it mean for interest rates The Bank of England raised interest rates from 4 to 425 for the 11th consecutive time last month Photograph Amer GhazzalREXShutterstock In theory central banks should not respond immediately to a rise in oil prices and would only do so if there are knockon effects  businesses raising their prices or offering more generous pay awards to their workers In practice higher oil prices at this juncture will almost certainly make the Federal Reserve the Bank of England and the European Central Bank more cautious If  and it remains a big if  Opec succeeds in permanently pushing up oil prices the result will be that interest rates stay higher for longer That will increase the risk of recession

going to happen Flintham 61 from Rotherham is one of many who found the pandemic brought mental health challenges She experienced high levels of anxiety especially as she had elderly parents in poor health Every morning I would wake up stressed wondering if I my partner or parents would get Covid or die she says A very close friends husband died with Covid early on  it really brought home how bad it was Tina Flintham Research has found that in late 2020 British people in their 50s and early 60s were dealing with higher levels of psychological distress than they had ever experienced before in adulthood For many over50s the pandemic triggered a second midlife crisis with women worst affected Flintham who is now retired had been through a period of depression in her mid50s which she attributes to the menopause I was very low but I managed to carry on working It was a physical feeling of being down and went on for three months I was at the point of thinking go to the doctor but then it just went She says she gritted her teeth and got through it adding that she has always relied on exercise But lockdown brought new challenges for Flintham who worked for the local authority at the time Ive always been a very sociable person always meeting up with friends doing yoga and swimming but I had none of that to help me through I really missed swimming  I even dreamt about it She found taking walks in the nearby countryside was a godsend in coping with the stress I lost my confidence I dont go out half as much as I used to The turning point for her mental health came with the vaccine rollout and as society opened up While much of the anxiety began to dissipate she still feels its echoes Sometimes I wake up and have similar feelings about what today is going to bring I lost my confidence I dont go out half as much as I used to and I have to push myself to Once Im out Im fine but before I never even thought things like that Also being in confined spaces with lots of people  I still feel weird about that Mark Dawes Although Mark Dawes 60 had experienced bouts of mild to moderate depression before he was always able to cope by forcing himself to socialise and stay active But when the Londonbased charity worker lost his father on the second day of lockdown his grief blurred into depression for months I had to deal with the grief alone  even the funeral had to be fully virtual as it was not possible to travel he says Living alone was very isolating and all social life was stopped  and relying on public transport meant I could not even travel to go walking in the nearby countryside While he has experienced psychologically challenging periods before this time the isolation felt very different It all ground to a halt Then you had the pandemic itself which was pretty scary when it started off It was a blur of days with no events in them I was living but not really living About a year into the pandemic Dawes began to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy and with the loosening of the pandemic started to feel better But he says there has been a lasting impact including not being able to properly grieve for his father I dont enjoy life as much as I used to I look forward to things less  lifes a bit greyer It all ground to a halt  I was living but not really living The pandemic also landed a blow to those who had never dealt with mental health difficulties before In the early months of lockdown Sally not her real name in her early 60s developed severe anxiety and low mood for the first time in her life I was completely taken by surprise as I have never suffered with these issues before I spent large parts of the day in tears Everyday tasks became difficult and over time I found it hard to face people At nighttime I shook had hot flushes bad dreams and struggled to sleep I am finally beginning to enjoy life again Sally who is retired and lives in the east Midlands became very fearful of Covid When some restrictions began to be relaxed I struggled to cope with seeing people even in the garden I didnt feel able to go to public places such as shops Each morning I woke up with a feeling of dread and sadness By October 2020 she realised she needed help and began talking therapy over the phone In the end I decided I needed to face my fears and get back to some kind of normal life I began by forcing myself to do things such as go into shops little by little not something that I found easy she says adding that returning to the gym was also important I no longer think about Covid every waking moment and I am finally beginning to enjoy life again

intended message is about something much less obviously appealing sewage The Liberal Democrat leader is posing with a series of dogs and their owners on Eastbourne beach a local election stop intended to bring attention to an issue his party has campaigned on enthusiastically for the past two years and with increasing cutthrough As Davey leads Marvin along the shingle 60 miles away in west London the environment secretary Thrse Coffey is announcing a series of partly recycled policies to clean up waterways an explicit acknowledgment of the damage the issue is causing to the government Lib Dem research shows pollution outflows both on beaches and into rivers and chalk streams is one of the most pertinent issues for voters in affected areas ahead of the local elections on 4 May Protesters outside a Thames Water sewage treatment works in Buckinghamshire Photograph Maureen McLeanRexShutterstock Josh Babarinde a Lib Dem councillor in Eastbourne who is also the candidate for the Conservativeheld parliamentary seat a key target for the party says sewage is raised spontaneously as often as the NHS during local door knocking It is one of the most common issues that comes up on the doorstep Beaches are the lifeblood of this town Speaking after the next leg in his day of campaigning a tour around the vast and hitech warehouse of a locally based book wholesaler Davey says sewage has even supplanted that perennial issue in local elections the pothole Its much bigger than potholes he said Potholes are a very serious issue and they do move votes but for sewage the reason why its so dramatic is it brings the pollution of our natural environment and the damage that its doing to our rivers and our seas and wildlife and plants and animals to human health The rise of sewage as an electoral issue is notable for several reasons one of which is how the Lib Dems chipped away at it for so long without notable interest from other parties It reached Lib Dem campaigners radar when voters in Chesham and Amersham kept bringing it up before the partys stunning byelection victory over the Conservatives in June 2021 the starting point for the idea of a blue wall of vulnerable Tory commuter belt seats When we started talking about sewage two years ago the other parties though it was a bit weird says one Lib Dem official But now they all want to talk about it This is very much the case Last week before Coffeys plan for cleaner water emerged a group of Conservative MPs representing Sussex seats met jointly with Southern Water and the Environment Agency in an attempt to spur action on a subject many fear is electorally damaging to them Labour too is very much aware of the subject with Keir Starmer accusing the government last week of turning Britains

voters becoming disenchanted with a government they feel is out of touch and takes them for granted Its the classic environmental issue where youre despoiling a public good and its the governments responsibility to stop it through regulation says Davey whose local election campaign schedule involves as one official put it a sewagerelated visit more or less every day This set of local elections is Davey says in effect a dry run for a general election expected next year not least as internal party polling suggests a majority of former Tory voters who switch to the Lib Dems in May will stay with them This set of seats was last fought in 2019 when the Lib Dems won more than 700 councillors as the Conservatives and Labour struggled under the leadership of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn respectively Defending those seats let alone winning more is a tough ask but Davey is confident the party riding what could be termed a sewage tidal wave can do it Doing better than 2019 perhaps our best local elections ever would really be something he said I think it would send a real shiver amongst the Tories They would see us coming for them

many others this has happened to and who has accessed my personal details British Gas has form on blind dates such as these Last year a customer logged on to find someone elses details under her name then her address was transposed on to someone elses account British Gas blamed an isolated system fault FGs surreal saga is it insists completely unrelated It was an error during planned maintenance lasting for 16 minutes and exposed the data of 32 customers It says all have been contacted and the Information Commissioners Office ICO has been informed It reckons no harm was done because the company takes data protection extremely seriously We can confirm no passwords or banking information were disclosed and customers do not need to take any further action it says We are sorry that this incident happened Individuals concerned about how personal data has been handled can contact the ICO but only if the company has failed to resolve the matter Act 2 LG is going blamelessly about his life in London but all is not as it seems Energy bills have been arriving from Scottish Power for two years addressed to the Owner Owner Occupier sic LG has never been a customer of Scottish Power but the company does not let a technicality such as that get in its way In vain does he send the company bills from his longstanding supplier The mystery account has he is told been closed but weeks later it springs back to life and unleashes more bills for everincreasing sums Then a knock at the door reveals a bailiff threatening to cut off his energy supply Scottish Power does not provide a comment but does cancel the account after which LGs meter mysteriously stops working He is unable to take a final reading when he moves and has therefore received an inflated final bill based on estimates from his current supplier Act 3 EON is adamant a vulnerable social housing tenant owes it 6528 on a final bill and has unleashed a debt collection agent It has not actually issued the final bill and the tenant was not actually living at the address when the charges were incurred None of this is of any interest to the debt collection firm or EON His social worker eventually elicits the period being charged for and sends proof her clients tenancy ended two months before it began She is promised a final bill showing supply dates and consumption Instead another letter demands immediate payment for unspecified usage over unspecified dates Each time I ring the agency new demands for information are made and nothing happens she says My client who has very limited funds is becoming increasingly stressed I fancy myself adept at exorcisms but EON proves as hard to nail down as ectoplasm It promises it will call off debt collectors and cancel charges but doesnt confirm this for another six weeks It never does explain why he was charged after moving out and why his complaints were ignored Act 4 JB of Bothwell South Lanarkshire has a hungry prepayment meter that she has topped up ever since she moved into her home two years ago When she applies for her energy support vouchers Scottish Power insists that she has a smart meter and owes it 418 Eight calls and online chats fail to move the monolith Neither do photos showing the meter and topup key When I intervene Scottish Power blames butter fingers on the national database that caused the wrong address to be selected from a dropdown menu A lucky stranger with a smart meter has therefore received JBs discounts Scottish Power promises to cancel the bill and issue a goodwill payment Instead JB receives a bill for 492 Back

took charge of the situation with all the wisdom of a man going into hospital for brain surgery then binning off the doctor to operate on himself Or to put it another way exactly the kind of behaviour one might expect from a 49yearold man with a sweepover fringe and long straggly bits at the back who thinks that Big Cupwinning managers must bow to the flawless logic of his superior exchequer For his part Tuchel  since recruited by the Big Cupshy ignoramuses of Bayern Munich  spent part of this morning lamenting the extent to which Chelsea has changed pining for the good ol days when it was owned by a Russian oligarch The Daily is choking up Back at the Bridge meanwhile they hit upon another winning ruse appointing a noleague winning manager but with the affable compliance that made him and ideal fit for Todd Except in an incredible turnup for the books their brave new world of vulgar spending with no overarching strategy turned out to be rubbish so poor Graham Potter was let go with his metrosexual rollneck still bobblefree and his thatthereLondon beard still getting acquainted with its host face So theres sure to be an interesting atmosphere at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea  who sit 11th in the table  entertain Liverpool scaling the lofty heights of eighth It may be that after dominating the league by winning one consecutive title Jrgen Klopps alltime great side are sated by success and are impervious to cheesy rabblerousing and performative passion Or it may be that bussing all the money in the world on 74 strikers might not have been the smartest tactic Particular

than anyone that he was chosen to hold the fort until Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali can convince Julian Nagelsmann Mauricio Pochettino or Luis Enrique to take over  could hold his head up high Whether the Spaniard is still here by the time Chelsea visit Real Madrid next week remains to be seen but at least his players listened to him At least there was no mutiny on or off the pitch The applause at the end was respectful enough and while another draw keeps Chelsea in the bottom half victory would have been theirs if they had anyone capable of putting the ball in the back of the net by legal means Liverpool were lucky Jrgen Klopp had tried some shock therapy dropping some of his biggest players but his sides identity has disappeared Ultimately these sloppy stodgy away performances from Liverpool are no longer a surprise and with the gap to fourth place now seven points it is going to take something special for them to qualify for the Champions League Not that Klopp who argued that Liverpool had done the ugly things well is writing off his sides topfour hopes before they host Arsenal I dont know if theres any opportunity for that he said We must win all our games

to address it as a priority PA Media Was this helpful Thank you for your feedback So do Chelsea though positives are hard to find The disastrous Potter experiment is over and the man asked to pick up the pieces had never picked a team before facing Liverpool It is hardly an ideal situation for Bruno whose longterm future is surely linked to Potter and he cannot even be sure if he will be in charge

poor clearance from Kepa Arrizabalaga only for Kalidou Koulibaly to rescue Chelseas goalkeeper Diogo Jota also threatened and the half ended with Liverpool on top Darwin Nez and Gomez tested Arrizabalaga and Wesley Fofana diverted an attempt from Fabinho Chelsea who would apologise for some tasteless chants from their fans needed to regroup They hope to have a permanent manager delivering the halftime message soon Contact has already been made with Luis Enrique and Nagelsmann But why take over this mess of a squad now Chelsea are short of goalscorers and they were at it again at the start of the second half Kovacic blazing over Was it going to be one of those nights It felt that way when Kant spotted a gaping hole in Liverpools defence Havertz saw his initial effort saved by Alisson and the Germany forwards celebrations were cut short after a VAR review confirmed the rebound had gone in off his arm Conviction eluded Chelsea A tiring Kant came off Bruno made some attacking changes and Liverpool introduced Salah Yet both sides were blunt Their fourth consecutive goalless draw will not live long in the memory
