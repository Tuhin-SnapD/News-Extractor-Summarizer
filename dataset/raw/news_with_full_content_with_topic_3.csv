The states laws it says require people who want to watch pornography to prove they are over 18. People seeking to access Pornhub are directed to a governmentlinked site where they can provide their ID. The move is the result of new laws designed to stop children from seeing explicit content. But it is just the beginningthe online ageverification industry is heating up. Since January three other states across the USMississippi Virginia and Utahhave copied Louisianas approach passing their own versions of ageverification laws. Another 11 states from Virginia to California have proposed laws that will require users to confirm their age before they can view pornography according to recent analysis. Some of these regulations are slated to take effect in the coming months. Its not just a US phenomenon either. Across the Western world efforts are underway to introduce more age checks online. Since 2020 regulators in Germany and France have pushed porn sites to check peoples ages and the UK and Australia are developing their own laws. These follow the introduction of more stringent safety rules that protect children online. The internet isnt a childfriendly place. However introducing age verification across the web is technical and complex. In 2019 the UK ditched a multiyear plan to introduce age checks after encountering myriad problems. The porn we watch is also highly sensitivekinks are incredibly personal and leaks of data online can be devastating. Privacy advocates porn companies and some regulators say the move to introduce age verification introduces significant problems. The concerns about young people accessing adult websites are real and widespread less widespread is the understanding of limitations of various ageverification tools and of the new dangers they might pose says Irina Raicu director of the Internet Ethics Program at Santa Clara Universitys Markkula Center. Many regulators and others seem to think of age verification as a solved problem technologists and privacy activists including activists focused on protecting children are trying to explain thats not the case. For years the only thing stopping people from accessing porn online has been small checkboxes Are you over 18? Yes or No? However legislation proposed around the world would add more robust checks. Dozens of online ageverification companies have cropped up with multiple ways to prove youre old enough to access sites. Your age can be confirmed by credit card details scans of your face or as is often proposed checks of government ID documents such as passports or drivers licenses. The checks can be carried out by thirdparty companies without sensitive information being passed directly to porn sites. One briefing from the European Commission details nine different methods of age verificationsome sophisticated some very low tech. A lot of stuff is being passed says Mike Stabile director of public affairs at the adult industry trade body the Free Speech Coalition. In terms of the actual implementation and how its going to workthats much more mysterious. The porn industry isnt against agechecking everyone who visits its websites Stabile says but some laws are vague and dont say how age verification should be implemented or whether all companies would be required to introduce the technology.,For the past three months anyone who lives in Louisiana and opens up Pornhub has been met with a new prompt.

https://www.wired.com/story/germany-twitter-porn-police/,They Posted Porn on Twitter German Authorities Called the Cops,Regulators are using an AI system to scan websites and messaging apps to find pornography Creators face fines and potential prison sentences,Paulita Paupel who runs the European branch of the adult industry trade body the Free Speech Coalition says the crackdowns are having worrying impacts on people and their ability to share content o 3323 chars,The last thing Tim and Julian Blesh expected when they got home from traveling at the start of March was a letter from the police. Printed under the masthead of Polizei Berlin the letter outlined criminal charges They had unlawfully shared porn on the internet. The onepage letter is distinctly vague. It doesnt say where on the internet they were accused of sharing pornography illegally nor which specific law they have broken. The couple who for the past six years have run an amateur porn project alongside their day jobs called the police to find out what was going on. An investigator told the couple that the police had found porn on their Twitter account Tim says. The police had screenshots of the material and crucially had identified a lack of measures to prevent children from potentially seeing the adult content. As a result the couple could face a fine of thousands of euros. The Blesh couple isnt alone. In recent weeks more than a hundred porn creators and models in Germany have received identical letters and face criminal proceedings. The letters and police action signal an escalation in Germanys porn crackdown and come as authorities are using an artificial intelligence system to detect pornography. Regulators have developed an AI system dubbed KIVI to spot pornography and offensive content on Twitter TikTok YouTube Telegram and morescanning thousands of public posts and web pages per day. Pornography isnt illegal in Germany but in recent years the nations media authorities have been taking action against pornography that is not protected by age verification technologies which require people to prove they are over 18 before they can see any adult photos or videos. Officials have ordered Twitter to block accounts and tried to impose a block on one of the worlds biggest porn websites for the entire German population. WIRED spoke with three separate Berliners who had received police letters about their posted material. They say the tactics have scared them into not sharing content. They have deleted thousands of tweets and say they feel censored. I feel ashamed sometimes says one person who asked not to be named so they dont damage their ongoing case. Thats having a psychological impact on me they say adding All I wanted to do is express my sexuality. Censored and Scared In Germany the Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media KJM is responsible for protecting children online. Under the body are 14 state media authorities which are responsible for individual regions. The countrys laws say it is illegal to make pornography accessible to someone who is under 18. In Germany the distribution of pornography on the internet is only permitted in closed user groups with prior age verification says a spokesperson for the North RhineWestphalia media authority. The agency has been at the forefront of the action against online pornography and critics say it is led by those with conservative views. Since this is not the case on Twitter the distribution of pornography via Twitter in its current form is not permitted in Germany the spokesperson says. Many of the recent police reports relate to porn being shared on Twitter and stem from Berlins Media Authority. Tim Blesh says he knows around 10 gay creators who have been targeted recentlysome have received notices from Twitter saying their accounts break German laws and content should be removed while others have gotten the letters from police. After receiving the letter and calling the police for more information Blesh says the couple contacted a lawyer and are now waiting for the police to formally provide evidence of potential wrongdoing. Blesh believes they are likely to receive a fine but it is also possible that any of the cases could end up in court.,The last thing Tim and Julian Blesh expected when they got home from traveling at the start of March was a letter from the police.

https://www.theverge.com/23658648/mastodon-ceo-twitter-interview-elon-musk-twitter,Can Mastodon seize the moment from Twitter,CEO Eugen Rochko on running  and growing  a decentralized social network gaining an influx of users in the wake of Elon Musks Twitter meltdown,Photo illustration Will Joel  The Verge CEO Eugen Rochko on running  and growing  a decentralized social network Eugen Rochko is the CEO of Mastodon  the opensource decentralized compet 62094 chars,Eugen Rochko is the CEO of Mastodon  the opensource decentralized competitor to Twitter. Its where a lot of Twitter users have gone in our postElon Musk era. The idea of Mastodon is that you dont join a single platform that one company controls. You join a server and that server can show you content from users across the entire network. If you decide you dont like the people who run your server or you think theyre moderating content too strictly you can leave and take your followers and social graph with you. Think about it like email and youll get it. If you dont like Gmail you can switch to something else but you dont have to quit email entirely as a concept. Now if you are like me you hear the words open source and decentralized and then the word CEO and think wait why does the decentralized open standard have a CEO? The whole point is that no single person or company is in charge right? Well welcome to the wild world of opensource governance. Its a riot my friends. Youre going to hear me and Eugen say the phrase benevolent dictator for life in dead seriousness because thats how a lot of these projects are run. Of course we also talk about money and structure. Mastodon doesnt make a lot of money and Eugen is figuring out how to build a structure that scales past just a handful of people. This tiny and mostly volunteer labor of love might very well be the future of social networking and if you believe the hype about ActivityPub might have some part in the future of the web. Thats pretty exciting even if things seem a little messy in the moment. The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Eugen Rochko is the founder and CEO of Mastodon. Welcome to Decoder. Hi. Hello. Its very nice to have you here. Mastodon is having quite a moment but I know youve been working on this project for a long time. I think theres actually quite a lot to talk about. Yes indeed. Lets start at the very beginning. Mastodon is in popular conversation right now as a competitor to Twitter but thats not really what it is and not really where it started. What is Mastodon? I mean its not that far off from where it started. I started working on it in 2016 because I thought that something as important as Twitter should not be in the hands of a single company. I was a pretty heavy Twitter user back then  I think I started using it in 2008 or so when I was a teenager  and it quickly became a very important part of my life for talking to friends or finding out what was happening in the world. Around 2016 I felt fed up with how Twitter was being run as a company where it was heading the community that was on there the harassment and so on. I started looking into alternatives and after viewing the landscape I decided to build a product of my own  and tried to make it good. I appreciate that. What I mean specifically by Its not exactly like Twitter is that Twitter is a company. Up until recently it was a publicly traded company that had investor reports had to make a profit and had employees that controlled the entire product. Mastodon is not that in almost any way. Indeed. Mastodon is free and opensource software that allows you to create a social media server or platform that connects to a decentralized network of similar servers all talking the same protocol and allowing not only different Mastodon servers to exchange information but also other software that speaks the same protocol. Its a very powerful ecosystem with a lot of potential. When you say youre the CEO of Mastodon but the product itself is opensource software that anybody can run how does that work? What are you actually the CEO of? Listen to Decoder a show hosted by The Verges Nilay Patel about big ideas  and other problems. Subscribe here! I am the CEO of the company Mastodon which works on the software called Mastodon. Its slightly confusing perhaps but its also fairly straightforward about who is making the software. Its us and we have the same name. For the longest time it was just me. I started working on this in 2016 when I was still in uni. After graduating I started a Patreon page for it which was 5 per month for a while. Then it gradually increased to making I dont know like 200 per month or 600 per month. It was enough for me to live off of in my situation back then and I started working on it fulltime. I was technically a sole proprietor which is a type of way to do business in Germany you basically just represent yourself as a company. That went on for a long time actually until 2021 which is when we finally incorporated a separate legal entity for Mastodon. Over time we got more people contributing to the code. Some were on a voluntary basis and there were a lot of driveby contributors on GitHub. Over 700 people have contributed lines of code to the software. There are also people we work with regularly such as the contractors that I hired. Right now compared to where it started its quite a sizable company. Theres me who is a fulltime employee developer CEO whatever you want to call it and another developer Claire. We also have a CFO on a contract basis and a talent manager and we are hiring for three more positions fulltime. We have two developers working on our iOS app and one developer working on the Android app all contractors. Then there is a user experience design agency that works with us on a contract basis. Thats about it but it is quite a lot of people to manage. So the company itself  and Im just keeping a rough count here  has four fulltime people a handful of contractors and an outside agency? Well currently there are two fulltime people but were hiring for three more. In the end it would be five people. Is the talent manager also on a contract basis? Yes. Okay. Decoder for me is all about structure. How do these things happen? How do we put these companies together? For Mastodon theres a lot of pressure on the protocol and theres a lot of interest in it. There are a lot of new servers being spun up. Then theres having to develop and manage the development of a large opensource project like Mastodon itself. How do you split the time between all the things people want Mastodon to do all the features people might wish to add to it and you actually running your company? Im not going to lie it has been quite tough since November. For most of Mastodons lifetime it wasnt as difficult because the pressure on the project was much lower even during busy times. I mean Mastodon didnt just pop up out of nowhere in November 2022. We had our runins with global fame even going as far back as 2017. Thats when it went viral for the first time and magazines like Mashable and The Verge covered us. In hindsight it was much lower pressure back then. I was able to manage on my own but now clearly the pressure is much much larger. Its not enough for just me to be involved in the project. It needs to expand there needs to be more people working in different areas and there needs to be more delegation. Since November it has basically been a whole ongoing project within our company to figure out the hiring process because were basically hiring for the first time. As you can tell from the story I told about the development of the company the first step is basically going from just me to more people and more fulltime employees. Its a huge step and its a new process for us so were spending a lot of time figuring out Okay these are the key roles that we need to fill as soon as possible. Again were also dealing with a limited budget even though a lot more people donated through our Patreon in November. It was a huge explosion of funds  going from 7000 per month to 30000 per month. That is a big budget increase which allowed us to look into hiring more people but its still a constrained budget. So we had to figure out Okay these are the key positions that will have maximum impact on what Mastodon is doing as a company. We decided we need a DevOps person because I cant be running the company and solving technical issues 247. We need another developer so somebody else can work with Claire when Im not around. We need a product designer. We got this far with me doing the design and figuring out usability and user experience but Im not actually qualified to do that. And I want Mastodon to be the best product it can be. I want it to be polished and I want it to be on par with any commercial alternative you might throw at it. Its really important for me to find the right design person who would also be able to take ownership and initiative at this stage. A lot of larger companies have whole teams working on delegated tasks but in our case we have to find somebody whos able to multitask a little bit and fill the role that I had to fill until now. I want to come back to all of that because I think its very interesting. Just being on this podcast a lot of people are going to come talk to you and Im very curious to see how that goes. But I want to sit for one second in what I think of as the middle stage which very few people pay attention to. I always think about this when listening to the story of a band or something. The band forms they play one show in a garage and then everyone skips to them playing in stadiums. Youre kind of in the Oh boy we better staff up so we can play in stadiums part of the journey. That middle part for you is between 2016 2017 when we covered Mastodon as it launched and November which is when Elon bought Twitter and had all the attention. What made you stay convicted in Mastodon that this was a thing? Regardless of the big spikes of growth the challenges and the financial limits you had why did you stay focused on it? You were ready for the moment in November of 2022  the product was there the servers were there the ecosystem and the community was there. Its very important to be ready for the moment but you couldnt have possibly known it was coming. So what made you stay focused? Well I would argue that I couldnt possibly have known the moment was coming then but the writing was on the wall for me back in 2016 that something was going to happen sooner or later. Do you mean something with the big social networks or something with Twitter specifically? Nobodys talking about MySpace like its a relevant thing anymore... I never believed that Twitter would be completely immune to that. Just a shift because social media websites come and go. They die. Even if they stay around like MySpace did nobodys talking about MySpace like its a relevant thing anymore. There are plenty more that have literally disappeared like App.net Google Plus Friendster or whatever. It is a graveyard and I never believed that Twitter would be completely immune to that. You can see that for all seven years Ive worked on this with a preparation for this sort of thing just without knowing exactly when it would happen or what to do. It has been a long process of figuring out the right features the right designs and the right messaging how to do this and how to do that so I will not claim that I had all the details figured out from the start. It was a long process to figure stuff out. So youve described the financial journey here as 600 a month to 7000 a month to 30000 a month all on Patreon. Is there another source of revenue? Or another potential source of revenue? No thats pretty much it. Over the years we have created an additional platform for the highertier Patreon sponsors to give us money as a sponsorship which allows us to give them invoices back and save on Patreon fees a little bit. Thats the only thing. For the most part Mastodon is financed through Patreon and the platform we built for the higher tiers. Thats it. Last year we did receive a grant from NLnet which is a grant that comes from the European Commission for opensource projects that work on decentralized social networks. That was a little bit of site funding but it was a onetime thing. In the past there was another one a prototype fund project but that was more like a personal grant kind of thing. Sometimes you find grants that sponsor people who work on opensource projects and it can help continue working on this. To answer your original question on why I stuck around I believe in the vision. I believe that Mastodon is the better way to do social media. Ive stuck around because well Im dogfooding it. I am using it. Its my daily driver and I have a home feed that I look at every day. I share whats happening in my life or the music I listen to on my Mastodon profile. I most enjoy Caturday and looking through and sharing cat pictures every Saturday. So thats why Ive stuck around. Of course there is a personal element to this as well in that its kind of a cool job to have. Youre doing something unique. In a way youre getting paid to work for yourself at your own pace. Sometimes that means times are quiet and theres not much to do and unfortunately sometimes that means that you have to work pretty much nonstop. That can be extremely stressful and extremely draining like it has been for the past three months. That is the downside. Usually people go through that experience at a startup because they have equity and might go public or because they might sell the Facebook for a huge amount of return. Do you see that outcome for yourself? Will there be some kind of exit from Mastodon where youll reap some sort of massive financial reward? Or is it This is the vision. Its an opensource project and we need to stay focused and idealistic? Its not really why I went into this and no I dont see that. It is an opensource project it is free software theres nothing to be reaped from it but I think I see a good future for Mastodon growing both as a network and as a project. My wage right now is really rather low and for the most part thats because when new funds come into the project there are important things that need doing more than paying myself more money. But I am hoping that there will be a breakeven point where Ill be able to have a dignified wage as well. Fair enough. This is the classic Decoder question. Just listening to you it sounds like youve had to make an escalating set of ever more complicated decisions since you started this project and it was just you. Youre now at what might be the most fun part which is staffing up figuring out who to hire and how to hire. How do you make decisions? What is your framework to make decisions? A framework to make decisions sounds very serious indeed and it makes me wish that I had a more elaborate answer to that. Sometimes my decisionmaking is led by what the community is asking for but of course it all comes down to my vision for the project and what I think is right. That is my framework for considering community suggestions or community demands and figuring out what the project needs and what it should avoid. In the future I am really looking forward to having a more organized model for this kind of decisionmaking. The keyword that has been thrown around is participatory governance. Now Im not going to promise anything specific but that is something Im talking to a couple people about. One thing that I would want to get out of something like that is a more organized way of inferring community opinion about specific features or directions because at the moment it is quite chaotic. The main way that people can voice their opinion about what should or shouldnt be in Mastodon is issues on GitHub which is basically feature requests bug reports on our source code repository. If somebody submits a feature request how do you know if thats something a lot of people wanted and would benefit from or if thats something that only one person would benefit from and a whole bunch of people would hate? Right now its very chaotic. My wish is to find a way to have some kind of vehicle where people would feel like theyre represented. I would get a way to know theyve made their decision so I can then either go along with it or not. But I would know that theres some kind of backing to it instead of trying to figure out Okay 40 people on GitHub have given a thumbs up to this feature request. What does that mean for the 2 million people using Mastodon today? How you build a social network using the tools of social networking seems like a recursive problem. We could do the entire podcast and probably an entire conference on opensource governance models. There have been a lot of them over time and each of them has tradeoffs. Ill just use Linux as an example because Im confident the audience is familiar with it. At the top of Linux is Linus Torvalds and he literally has the title of Benevolent dictator for life of Linux and that is the governance model that flows down from that title. Are you thinking I have to pick one of these wellworn models? Thats how it is right now. Honestly I subscribe to that model. I think its effective and I think that it leads to a better product. A good product needs longterm vision and it needs cohesive vision. Thats something that a committee cannot give. When you have a lot of people who have pet issues and one thing that they care about it kind of ends up being a patchwork. It loses some of its focus and it can end up in a situation where it just stops being a good product and becomes too confusing. Sometimes you need to make executive decisions about changing stuff in a serious way which might not be popular with what most people in a committee would want. I dont look down on the benevolent dictator for life model. I think it has its place in open source at least. So I dont look down on the BDFL model. I think it has its place in open source at least. I would not make any comments or claims about other areas of life but in open source I think it makes sense. Thats what I would prefer to stick with but that doesnt mean I dont think theres better ways to involve other people and have better communication. One more question here and then I want to talk about Mastodon its community and how its working as an actual social platform. What youre describing right now is familiar in shape if not in the specifics. Its an opensource product that has found productmarket fit or at least the opportunity for productmarket fit. Its going to grow really fast and you need some help scaling. This is when venture capital firms show up at your door and say Look we know how to do DevOps. We can install a bunch of lawyers to help you figure out opensource governance. Look at all these tools. Heres a whole army of people that have done this before. Let us give you the money to help and well scale it as fast as we can. Has that been happening to you? Weve definitely had a lot of people from venture capital firms reach out to us. Weve even tried having a few conversations just to see where they were at and what they wanted. We obviously had considered ways to have a more sustainable funding model for the opensource project that would not rely on Patreon. We have explored if maybe there would be a way to find funding for that. I cannot say that anything productive has come out of it. Weve rejected every venture capital firm that has reached out to us so far. Now when I say a more sustainable funding model for the project I obviously mean software as a service because its the most natural way for an opensource project to basically find a business model for itself. You have a product that you have the most familiarity with and you can offer it to other people in a way where they dont have to figure out how to install it how to manage it and so on. It is quite natural and it has been on my mind for quite a few years as a sort of backup plan in case people stop donating to the Patreon for some reason. But theres a lot of activity in that space right now. A lot of these hosting firms are starting to jump up. I think we could have an edge in that space but it also doesnt seem like a priority right now if Im honest. Are you rejecting all the VC firms because the pitch is basically the same for all of them? Well give you a bunch of money and resources but were looking for 30X revenue growth or whatever? A hosting business is not really venture capital scale. It doesnt promise the same returns. What they seem to be interested in is Well give you money now and you dont have to think about monetizing but in two years lets figure out how we could turn your opensource project around. Thats kind of a nogo zone for me. Its a trap. Its clearly against our projects ideals. Lets talk about the Mastodon community and the product. So I kind of understand the company now. I understand very clearly that you have a specific set of ideals  about how you want to run the company about the nature of decentralized social networks and about moderation. I do want to talk about all those things. Right now the basics of the community are that you download the Mastodon software from Mastodon the company. You can spin up your own server and try to get your own users for it. Then you can in a federated way send messages back and forth across these servers. How many users does Mastodon have now across instances? God. I am actually unprepared for this question because the statistics API on our official website has not been functional for a couple days. I need to change the code a little bit to make it more efficient. I have actually not kept up with it but I would say at least 1.5 million monthly active users. Okay. In November when Elon took over Twitter you saw a huge spike. What does that spike look like? That spike was 2.5 million monthly active users. So it has gone down since then? Yeah but theres a caveat to that spike. The way that active users are counted on Mastodon in the software is when you log in and every person who signs up logs in. Its kind of inflated through people who sign up and then bounce so its natural for it to go back down to more natural levels. Its just an unfortunate side effect of how the statistics were implemented in it. Its impressive because the big number highlights how many people checked out Mastodon but its also normal for that number to go back down to a more level area again. Are you still growing? Yes its still growing and in fact its growing faster now than it was before because of some changes we did to our official labs as well as the changes we did to the official joinmastodon.org website. I adjusted the sorting to highlight bigger servers first. Its a big change from what it used to be where we tried to highlight smaller servers. A lot of them at the top were the ones where you cant create and cast straight away but you have to wait for approval. That was just not very userfriendly. Now the ones with larger open registrations are at the top. Of course that has had a very quick effect on increasing the growth. Similar changes have been made in the official apps as well as the onboarding improvements in general that weve been working on since November. Theyve finally been released on both iOS and Android. They include both a better explanation of what the hell decentralization is and what the servers are before you get thrown into the server list. Also changes to the server list allow a bit more sorting and displaying information in a better way. It also provides a pick for me option where if you dont make a selection it gives you a random one. I have an account on mastodon.social which is the one that you run. By the way I follow Eugen. Hes not kidding with the cats thing in case youre listening. That was 100 percent true. But theres all sorts of other servers. What are the economics of running one of those servers? To me that is one of the most difficult things to understand. I spin up a Mastodon server on Squarespace or whatever hosting company wants to let me do this very easily. I run it I get users and I have to pay Squarespace. Do I the administrator of the server make any money? Is there anything built into the platform that lets me make any money doing this? When you host Mastodon for yourself youre in control. You own it. It is your megaphone. No not really. Its not really about making money off of hosting Mastodon. Its that when you host Mastodon for yourself youre in control. You own it. It is your megaphone. Nobody can kick you out tell you what you can or cannot say or take your data and sell it to a third party. Its your complete ownership over your own social media platform without losing global reach because people can follow you from other servers. Hosting a Mastodon server for yourself your family or a small private group of people that you know is really relatively simple and not too expensive. You do need either a hosting provider somebody who will offer Mastodon as a service or a small virtual private server from DigitalOcean or a similar hosting company. If you have the knowhow to install programs on Linux and run them you can just install Mastodon you just need your own domain name and there you go. When you run the server for yourself you dont really need to think about things like moderation because youre just responding for yourself. Obviously youll need to block bad actors and stuff but youre just doing it for yourself you dont have to worry about community management. Then a completely different side from this is when you want to run a server for a community or the public. Its a whole different level of responsibility and it obviously involves moderation burdens. You need to moderate or find people who will moderate for you. Sometimes for smaller communities people just do it out of their pocket because the community matters to them or its an offshoot of their main community website like if they have a forum and get a Mastodon server as a bonus value add to that. We could actually talk about Medium as an example of that because Medium has spun up their own Mastodon server. Now they are a publishing platform for longform articles for writers. What do writers do? They usually announce what theyve written on social media in short form content. Mastodon is a perfect fit for them to basically offer it as a valueadd. You have your Medium account and you can sign into Mastodon to post about what youve just written on Medium and drive traffic to your writings that way. Thats one example of how it fits with something that already exists. Of course for other cases the Mastodon servers that arent monetized  if thats the right word  are through Patreon. Basically people are providing a service and then some people who value that service donate back to keep it afloat. So mastodon.social is the one that Mastodon the company runs? Correct. That is I would say the most famous one for lack of a better word. You open signups you close signups. Why do you sometimes close signups? In the past it has been a huge burden especially when I was working alone to wrestle with the scaling problems or the technical issues of running a largescale server at the same time as running a company and writing code. Thats just one side of it. The other side is that ideologically speaking Mastodon is a decentralized social network. We dont want to promote a single node more than other ones. The ideal system is one where there are a whole bunch of different servers all roughly the same size and it doesnt matter which one you use because theyre all interconnected. Because when you get to a situation where one single node is much much bigger than all the others the problem is that it gets disproportionate power to change things and enforce its own whims. An example of that is email and the situation with Gmail. Gmail is huge. They have very good spam filters but unfortunately those good spam filters sometimes catch people who try to selfhost email. It creates a situation where its so difficult to selfhost email that youre basically forced to just go use Gmail or one of the other large providers instead. Thats the kind of situation we ideally want to avoid in Mastodon and in the fediverse which is the name for the network that Mastodon is basically a part of based on this activity protocol. We want to avoid that so for that reason we have historically been trying to promote a healthy distribution of people across these different servers. However Ive learned over the years that there is no replacement for having a default right? Im sure you realize. When people are used to just going on a website and creating an account presenting them with a choice of hundreds of different servers all provided by different people and organizations that they dont know it is quite a paradigm shift. Its quite difficult for people to grasp at first sight. The power of somebody like Elon in the fediverse is greatly diminished. Really it is a strength of the platform that there is such a diversity of offerings. On Twitter you just have Elon Musk. If he decides to do X theres nothing you can do about it. On Mastodon you still have the potential for a mini Elon in some ways but unlike Twitter you have the option to just take your account and go somewhere else or to start your own and still participate in the network. The power of somebody like Elon in the fediverse is greatly diminished. Thats the strength of it but to realize that strength you basically need to be into the idea already. For that we need a simple conversion a simple signup that people can go through without too much hassle or being presented with a completely different way to do things thatll make them say Its too complicated I cant choose. Thats what Ive realized over the years. The idea right now is to keep registrations open and continue having them open to the best of our ability. The only situation I can think of where we might close signups temporarily is if there are technical issues that affect quality of service. If lots of new people are joining and the servers are melting down the priority for us is to ensure that the people who are already using our server can continue to do so with good quality of service. If that means closing signups and directing people elsewhere then so be it. But the way we are expanding the company hiring a dedicated DevOps person and getting new funds I think will allow us to keep registrations open going forward. The Gmail comparison is really interesting here. I cannot believe Im about to explain Gmail to the Decoder audience but Im going to do it just so Ive said it out loud. Email is an open protocol that is run by standards organizations. Gmail runs on those protocols  SMTP IMAP and the rest  and so does Outlook or whatever. The reality for most people is that theres a collapse between the protocol and the application on their phone. If you have Outlook you are almost certainly not using the Gmail app. If you have Gmail you are almost certainly not using the Outlook app. Youre going to the service and putting that app on your phone. The only real exception to this rule is the Apple Mail app on the iPhone. With everything else theres a collapse between the protocol and how its expressed to the user. mastodon.social is the one you run. You download the official Mastodon app and its going to default you into it because defaults are important. I mean literally the number one criticism I hear from people is Well you have to pick a server and itll never work because no one wants to pick a server. Youre going to solve that problem but arent you now getting closer to that collapse between the open protocol and the user experience where people download the Mastodon app and end up on the Mastodon server? Well for reference right now mastodon.social isnt actually the default in our app. Its just one of the top ones that shows up. However I think that possibly going forward we might rework the onboarding user experience into presenting a default option as well as an advanced option where all that stuff with choosing a server would basically be hidden away from the people who get intimidated by choice. Yes you are correct in that it gets us closer to the Gmail situation. But its kind of unavoidable with the constraints of the problem Ive described where the choice is too complicated. You need to convince people that this is better and that this is something they should invest some time into. Then theyll realize both how it works and what they can do with it. That is the idea. The idea is the funnel. They get started on mastodon.social but afterwards they can move to an account on their own server that they create or on a different server provided by a different company or person. Historically that has been the case. A lot of people who are currently running their own servers had their first account on mastodon.social. So it is working and I imagine it will make mastodon.social somewhat disproportionately large in the future but thats just part of making it work I think. Is there a point at which the cost of mastodon.social will be too much and youll have to actually monetize it directly? Its hard to say if the cost will be too much and its equally hard to say if there will ever be a point where some kind of monetization is absolutely necessary. One thing that Ive looked into as part of our software offering as part of the Mastodon software somewhere down the line is a way for admins to monetize account creation to offer paid accounts like a premium email service would do. I think thats a very fair way to monetize. Right now its what people manage to do with Patreon basically an honor system and you just codify it into the software. Okay I pay you this amount per month and for that I receive an account and good quality of service. That makes sense to me. I cant say for sure if we ourselves will ever make use of something like that. Its hard to predict so long in advance and with unknown growth as well but it is something I want to make available for other admins so that there can be more sustainable business models in the fediverse. I realize I keep asking about money but one of the reasons I keep asking is that if you want to be a success on the scale youre talking about it actually needs to become an ecosystem. There need to be multiple kinds of business models and businesses using the protocol and using Mastodon. Thats what makes it resilient to change in a way that MySpaces business was not. Are you open to saying Okay some people are going to monetize this thing in a way that maybe I personally dont like or Im ideologically opposed to but in order for the ecosystem to thrive lots of people have to be trying lots of different things? Well I dont know about something that I would be ideologically opposed to. Youre one of the few CEOs Ive talked to that will state their values as clearly as you have so thats why I asked it that way. I think a diversity of business models in the fediverse would be a good thing. I think different people exploring different ways to do stuff in this ecosystem would benefit everyone. The bad business models would fail and the good ones would thrive hopefully. At the end of the day I think its good to be able to support these different business models. I think companies are eager to start building on top of the fediverse because for the first time in history its an ecosystem where one company cannot just pull the rug from under them by closing the APIs. Its open source so its built on open protocols. The API literally cannot be locked down in the way that Twitter is doing right now or has promised to do. When the developers from Tapbots build their Ivory app the premium paid iOS app for Mastodon they know for sure that I am not going to pull the rug from under them and they lose their existence. I welcome apps like that being built on top of the Mastodon API and I welcome other software being built on top of the ActivityPub protocol that integrates with Mastodon. I think its very exciting that Tumblr has announced ActivityPub support that Flickr has expressed interest in it. I was very happy when Vivaldi the browser announced their own Mastodon server. Mozilla has announced the same and Medium. Its extremely exciting. Those companies are announcing support for ActivityPub which is the underlying protocol from Mastodon. We had Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg on the show. He said ActivityPub is great. Fundamentally this is all blogging. My whole company is blogging whether its Tumblr WordPress.com or whatever. Were going to support this and be in full support of blogging. We talked to Mitchell Baker from Mozilla. She said Mastodon is really interesting. This is where Im pointed. First were just going to set up an instance and see how it works. You can see the turn there for her is building some ActivityPub support directly into the browser itself. Do you worry that Heres a lot of attention from big companies theyre just going to spin up their own massive instances or that Tumblr will become a sort of strange new default ActivityPub source? That well kind of just end up back at Twitter but with an underlying opensource protocol? That is the Gmail problem right? Open source doesnt factor into the protocol bit. Twitter based on an open protocol would be a good thing even in its current state. You would be able to follow the people you care about and be followed back by them without engaging with the actual platform. Instead of being locked into one commercial service you would be allowed to leave and build your own platforms and do something better without fighting against the network effects of a lockedin commercial platform. I see it as a good development no matter what when more platforms are announcing support. It means that the network the fediverse becomes more useful for everybody. If we create a future where a whole bunch of social networks are interoperable based on ActivityPub its a great future. Ideally that is also open source and everything but even without that it would still be a better situation for the web than right now. One of the things about ActivityPub that is interesting is that its closer to format agnostic than the other Its very versatile. Right. Versatile is a good word for it. Just as Instagram is incompatible with a tweet from the jump or a TikTok is not compatible with a Facebook post from the jump. Theyre just not the same thing and you can see how much work was done internally to retrofit something that looks like TikTok onto Facebook. ActivityPub is more versatile than that. The posts can be long and they can contain multimode media be that pictures and text or whatever it is. Do you think that someone might fork it and make it more specific? The social platforms that tend to win are the ones that kind of funnel everybody towards a particular format that captures the zeitgeist. Im specifically thinking of Friendster to MySpace to Facebook to Instagram to TikTok the funnel has been Just point a camera at your face and go. Youre kind of back to Well actually writing is the ne plus ultra of the internet. We should just do a good job at it. I would argue that this has already happened but not quite in the way youve described it. ActivityPub is the protocol for exchanging information in the programmatic way. In a programmatic way an Instagram photo maps onto the same structures as a video on YouTube or a post on Twitter. You can map these concepts onto very generic concepts and add all the necessary metadata as extra on top. Now Mastodon is a product built on top of this protocol that focuses on short micro blogs on short posts with videos or images attached or polls where people follow each other. But there are already other fediverse projects that focus on different aspects of the social experience like Pixelfed which is focused entirely on photos. Its a photo app so it isnt really concerned with shortform blogging its just concerned with photos. You can follow a Pixelfed user from your Mastodon account and vice versa. Then in your home feed on Mastodon you get all these photos that people on Pixelfed post on Pixelfed you get all the photos that a Mastodon user posts. It maps back onto each other  maybe not always 100 percent and it doesnt have to. As you say its so versatile. It doesnt always make sense. If there is a new platform that does something very very unique that would have no way of mapping onto what Mastodon is doing today and they would not have to share any space. Then there might be another platform that is kind of similar to that one and they would be able to interoperate using those same semantics. Theres a variety of these platforms on the fediverse and Pixelfed and Mastodon are just some of them. Theres another one called PeerTube which is one where you have channels and you can publish longform videos on them. Again you can just follow a channel on PeerTube from your Mastodon account and get those videos in your home feed. You can leave comments and then those comments appear on the videos. A reply on something like Mastodon which could be compared to Twitter really maps well onto a comment on a video on YouTube. Do you think theres any danger of one of those platforms saying Weve hit the limit here. Were just going to fork the Mastodon code and build our own version of this thing with a separate network that might have its own network effects and then that becomes a challenge to Mastodon? Of course something like that could happen with the protocol. There is an XKCD comic for that. The punchline is that you now have one more standard to care about. Its a very famous comic yes. I kind of walked into this answer. I think what speaks in favor of ActivityPub and Mastodon is that we have built up this network. We have built up some momentum and some network effects for this protocol which means that its not really in anybodys interest to start completely from scratch. Of course it doesnt stop everyone. Theres Jack Dorseys pet project Bluesky in which they analyzed all the different decentralized social media projects and decided to come up with their own completely separate from everything that came before it again. That stuff happens all the time. Theyve succeeded in hiring one person after this project. After two years of deliberations theyve published something. Now its quiet again. Theres Nostr which I think is also Dorseys. Yes theres that. As far as I know its just full of spam and people talking about cryptocurrencies. Stuff like that pops up but ActivityPub is a very promising technology. No protocol is perfect and can never be perfect. Thats important to acknowledge because you will never be able to make an ActivityPub 2 that will not have some issue that somebody will find and say Okay now we need ActivityPub 3. Acknowledging that you might come around to the conclusion that Okay ActivityPub is here. A lot of people are using it. Well stick to it and make it better. You can make it better because its a technology that can be extended. There are these basic concepts basic semantics but if theres something that doesnt map onto those semantics you can progressively add them on top of it for new features and new concepts. Then other people that interoperate with you can decide Okay we want to display that information in our app as well so well start supporting that. I have wanted to ask this set of questions because Im very curious how it works and how you think about making it work. The technology and how you personally think about who might use it and why is all based on the central notion that one company should not be in charge of social networking. You should not have a Twitter a Facebook or even a YouTube that is in control of how we express ourselves online. I ask these questions because I never really hear people ask them. I only hear people ask about the next set of things which is content moderation. I feel like you cant quite understand the content moderation aspect of Mastodon without understanding the governance of the protocol  but now I have to talk about content moderation. The point of this as far as I can tell is that you dont think one person should be in charge of content moderation. Yes. So anybody can start a server and they can impose any rules they want. Some of those rules can be very strict and some of them can be very permissive. Theres no central place to impose rules from your perspective. Yes exactly. As you come to a place where Mastodon socially becomes the default do you feel any burden to change the content moderation rules for the default server? We havent identified any issues with the rules we have right now. For the most part our users are happy and our moderation load is bearable. We have a bunch of paid moderators working on our server and as it grows the moderation team will obviously expand further and further. In the sense of rules I think its quite fair to keep them as they are. They are on the safe side of the gradient between permissive and safe but not too restrictive. I think its a good balance weve stricken over the experience of seven years of running that server. This is the challenge though. Small communities are relatively selfsustaining and selfmoderating to an extent. As they scale things get out of control very quickly and people start doing very bad things very quickly. We have written about the challenges moderators face on skilled social platforms for years now. Is that a set of challenges youre facing? Are people doing the worst possible things with your service? Do you have automated tools? How does that work for you? I would say that were lucky enough that due to our smaller size we havent had to deal with the kind of horribleness that lets say Facebook moderators have to deal with. Honestly most of our reports are either just generic spam or people being mean to each other. Its not the horrible stuff that Facebook moderators need therapy for. In that sense weve been lucky. To answer your question on automation we have avoided it so far because we believe in the personal approach. What allows this personal approach is the decentralization and the different size constraints. First of all back in regards to the rules it is actually quite liberating in a sense to have this decentralized network. You can say Okay these are the rules of the service that we offer. If youre not okay with it thats fine. You can go somewhere else where what you want is allowed or you can just run it on your own. We dont have any obligation to allow you to post this or that if you can just do it yourself on your own money. I just want to point out that this hypothesis has never been tested if you give people a choice of moderation regimes they will pick one that offers the most safety and they wont pick one that has the horribleness because right now everything is so centralized. This is a largescale test to see if the marketbased version of content moderation actually succeeds in the way people have always said it would. Yeah. Going from that point back to moderation this decentralized system also allows sharing the load of the moderation burden between completely different systems and completely different organizations. If you count a person running a server as a moderator then the lower bound of the number of moderators in the fediverse is something like 9000 or 10000 because thats the number of servers there are. If you count a person running a server as a moderator  the fediverse has a much higher ratio of users to moderators than any other commercial social media platform. Of course for the singleperson servers out there it doesnt really matter. As I said theyre not really moderating theyre just running their own personal platform. But for all these communities if you have 20 people and one moderator thats a much higher ratio of users to moderators than on any other commercial social media platform. This decreases the moderation burden for everybody because for the most part people take care of the rulebreakers on their own servers and the other moderator doesnt have to deal with it. This leads to challenges because what you want is a megaphone right? If youre a writer on Medium when you write the thing and post it to the Medium Mastodon instance youre not trying to get to 20 other Medium writers. Youre hopefully trying to address millions of people who follow you across Mastodon instances. They all might have different rules. If you write about some hotbutton issue that breaks a bunch of rules you wont actually reach all those people. Those communities also have to moderate themselves. You kind of end up at a place where its harder to know what is going to happen because there are so many fragmented rules as opposed to Im just mad at YouTube all the time because YouTube is too opaque. Im wondering if you see a balance there that actually results in something different. Right now I think the frustration most people have is that they dont know whats going to happen. I would say that content moderation is one of the hardest problems in social media. Theres no denying that. We can add features we can remove features we can improve how a button looks whatever. Content moderation is always going to be at the core and center of what makes a social media platform work. So yeah it is complicated. But to counter your point if you publish something about some hotbutton issue that a lot of people will disagree with they might not see it even if you have a centralized service where everything is allowed. Because theyll block you theyll filter out the word or theyll use a block list that theyve made themselves and share around. That sort of thing is not unique to the fediverse and to the decentralized system of moderation. If for whatever reason you get blocked by a server of 20 people well thats part of it. Just imagine you were blocked by 20 people for writing that issue. Now Im not saying that everything is perfect. For example I think that there needs to be more transparency for users about what is happening with moderation on their servers. I dont think its great that your admin can make a decision to block another server and then suddenly you lose a bunch of followers without knowing about it. I think that we need to build some kind of notification system into it that will tell you Okay your admin has made the decision to block this server and youve lost this amount of followers. If you disagree with this heres what you can do. As long as you have that then people can again move to a better server or start their own. Nobody really suffers right? I agree with you. I think content moderation is the most complicated part of operating a social network. My thesis is that it is fundamentally the product. Any Mastodon instance is only distinguished from the next because it has slightly different content moderation rules or a slightly different community and that community might selfenforce those rules. What Im curious about is that moderation is the cost even beyond server costs or whatever. As your community scales moderation and legal compliance become a cost that is almost unbearable for anyone except the largest companies in the world. Facebook has to run moderation services across the world they have to be in legal compliance across the world. Right now as we speak there is a Supreme Court case about Section 230 and Googles recommendation algorithm on YouTube. I dont know how thats going to go. I can point to two specific Mastodon examples here. The Financial Times I think started a Mastodon instance and shut it down within days saying Okay just the legal compliance costs of running the server are too high for us. The other one which was much funnier than that was a Harry Potter server that shut itself down because there was an argument about Harry Potter and the community got out of control. There are a lot of arguments about Harry Potter. That community is just fully out of control right now. If I start a server and it gets moderately popular then suddenly as an administrator my costs in money time legal fees or whatever it is start to skyrocket in a nonlinear way to my user base my activity or my financial return. Is there a way for you at the protocol level or at the governance level to bring that back in line? Or is it Well someones going to have to figure out how to monetize this to make those costs work out? First to address the Financial Times I think they made the fundamental mistake of trying to run a public server instead of just running a server for their own journalists and people who work for them. The moderation load even the technical investment required is completely different for these models. Im not going to recommend everyone start a public Mastodon server and start accepting registrations from the public and get thousands and thousands of users because it is a huge responsibility. It is a responsibility that comes with a cost and potential liabilities. Its not easy. Mastodon is a shortcut to starting your own Twitter for the public if you want but it comes with all of the costs problems and risks of running a public service like that. Is it easy to start a social network from scratch? No it absolutely is not. Imagine starting something like Twitter completely from scratch. Mastodon is what allows you to do that if you want to. Its a shortcut to starting your own Twitter for the public if you want but it comes with all of the costs problems and risks of running a public service like that. Now if you just run it for yourself because youre an author a blogger a publisher or an enthusiast and you want to consume content from other people on your own terms its a completely different model. Youre not really liable for anything because its just for yourself. Youre not really risking much and it doesnt cost a lot. You dont need to think about moderating or hiring moderators. For the servers that do run publicly and accept registrations from the public yes moderation comes at a cost. Now of course as I mentioned before the cost of moderation and the burden of moderation is shared across the entire network. It is a lot lower than if a single company was doing it for millions and billions of users. If all you have to manage is a community of lets say 5000 people unless you have a lot of churn  which means you have a lot of new people joining all the time  for the most part the people on your server will be wellbehaved because the bad ones will already have broken the rules and be suspended. Can I push you on this? I believe the same thing that you believe but Im not the CEO of Mastodon. Do you have data that says that is actually true? I feel like that is the lived experience of being on the internet. If your community is small it will selfregulate but when it gets big it goes nuts. If Im making this bet I would want to know that thats true. I could provide you with anecdotal counterfactuals right? I could tell you to look at Reddit which is a history of small communities fracturing into rival subreddits and that will go on for infinity. So is this something that you believe? Is this something that you know? Is this something that you can measure? Well its based on my experience running mastodon.social and the moderation loads that we get. Most of the reports that come to us are usually about people who have just signed up and dont belong here. Theyre the people who dont actually agree with our rules and break them straight away. During times when we had closed registrations the load on our moderation team was a lot lower. For the most part its quite straightforward really. The people who break rules show themselves very quickly. They get banned and then theres nobody left to break the rules. I feel like people sometimes overestimate the amount of reports and the amount of moderation necessary that comes with a specific server size with a specific amount of users. Most people dont regularly break the rules. It is still a minority of people who do that and a minority of cases where it happens. It only increases when you have lots of new people coming in and possibly if you have a troll army that decides to make a bunch of accounts which can also make the numbers go up. Otherwise it has been quite manageable so far. As you look across the spectrum of Mastodon instances do you actually see a diversity of rules? Do you see that Theres a spectrum. We have the most permissive sites and the least permissive sites? There is a spectrum but I think for the most part the majority of the servers that run Mastodon today have agreed on a certain set of rules  probably because a lot of them have been inspired by mastodon.social and our rules originally. There is a lot of overlap. Some are a bit more restrictive about specific things like content warnings the kinds of selfpromotion you can do or whether you can run an account as a company or a brand versus as a natural person. Sometimes people do get restrictive with those sorts of things. Obviously there is a side to the fediverse that is completely the opposite and leans towards permissive everything goes free speech everything. For the most part it is ostracized and distanced from the previous side. A lot of different approaches exist out there. Are they growing in parallel? Is one growing faster than the other? How is that playing out? Well I believe that our part grows faster because they get traffic from joinmastodon.org our official website and our official apps. So that helps. Do you worry that the other side the most permissive libertarian side is going to say This is unfair you need to list our servers as a default as well? Well there is no real obligation for us to link to anybody. Sometimes yeah I get people that are very upset with me for not giving them a free link from our official website but were not really obligated to provide a link to anyone. We just do it to make the signup process easier for end users. Were only going to link to a place if we think that people are going to be safe there and have a good time. If your server is allowing everything and all types of language that is completely inappropriate then theyre not going to be safe there and were not going to send them there. So theres that. Eugen youve given us a ton of extra time. I want to say thank you. Im very excited to see where Mastodon goes. I did sign up over the weekend. Decoder listeners know I took a break from Twitterlike networks to heal my brain after 10 years but I signed up for mastodon.social. Im excited to use the product. I have two feature requests for you. One its slow. Can you make it faster? Yes I think so. That would normally not be a software problem but an infrastructure problem something specific to mastodon.social. Honestly depending on when you accessed it it could have been a DDoS attack because that happens. Just last night I was looking into a traffic spike seven times higher than usual that was causing a lot of errors to appear. So if youre complaining about slowness it could be that. I would be happy to report that we are upgrading our infrastructure completely from what we were using before. Our infrastructure for mastodon.social basically grew out from a single box originally in 2016. We moved providers  I say we but back then it was just me  quite a few times during these seven years. Im trying to remember where our original box was. Probably DigitalOcean actually. We tried using Scaleway and then we eventually moved to Hetzner the German hosting company which is where we are right now. Basically it grew out of a single box into a cluster of 15 or 20 different machines manually managed by me. Right now were upgrading to using Kubernetes and that simplifies a lot of the scaling significantly. Where before it would take half a day to set up a new machine now its like Okay its a couple clicks and a couple of keyboard button presses and now you have the capacity for a lot more traffic than you had before. With that plus having a DevOps person on the case it will hopefully improve the speed by a lot. My second feature request actually has me curious if you feel the pressure to look and feel more like Twitter now than you did before. Can you do quote tweets? I often want to quote tweet someone from The Verge and say This is great look at this. I know that youre opposed to it but are you starting to reconsider? We could do a whole episode about quote tweets if I start talking about it now describing the history and the positions people have on this feature. Ill keep myself short. We have a public roadmap on our website and quote posts are under the exploring section of that roadmap. The most complicated section of all. It means that were looking into it and hopefully well bring you quote posts. I like it. Whats next for Mastodon? What should people be on the lookout for next? Groups probably. Thats a big feature thats coming. Well its what you would expect. Facebook has groups Twitter has communities and Mastodon will have groups as well. Very good. Eugen thank you so much for being on Decoder. Well have to have you back soon. Thank you and have a good day.,Eugen Rochko is the CEO of Mastodon  the opensource decentralized competitor to Twitter.

https://gizmodo.com/beethoven-genome-hair-health-cause-of-death-1850250043,Beethovens Genome Reveals Clues to His Bad Health and Early Death,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and genealogical history Read more,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and gene 5007 chars,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and genealogical history. Chief among them Beethoven had inherited genetic risk factors for liver diseases and was infected with hepatitis B taken alongside the composers alcohol consumption these likely contributed to his death at age 56. The teams research is published today in Current Biology. Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethovens health problems which famously include progressive hearing loss beginning in his mid to late20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818 said study coauthor Johannes Krause a biochemist specializing in ancient DNA at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany in a Cell Press release. Beethovenfamous for compositions like Bagatelle No. 25 popularly Fr Elise Sonata No. 14 Moonlight Sonata and Symphony No. 9is one of the most beloved figures in music history. Tens of thousands attended his funeral on March 29 1827. He was a talented pianist and had an intimidating work ethic when deafness beset him Beethoven put a resonator on his piano to amplify its sound and he eventually used vibrations to continue to compose. Though the researchers couldnt determine a certain cause of Beethovens deafness they gleaned numerous insights from his DNA. The genome was lifted from five preserved locks of wavy hair passed down through different families and friends. Several other locks of hair previously attributed to the composer turned out to not be his and onecalled the Kessler lockcould not definitively be attributed either way. Besides deafness Beethoven suffered from gastrointestinal issues gut pain and diarrhea and liver problems including two bouts of jaundice over the course of his life. The ailments became so severe that in 1802 he asked his favorite doctor Johann Adam Schmidt to describe and publicize the nature of his disease after his death. Schmidt ended up dying in 1809 18 years before Beethoven. Beethovens death is now generally attributed to cirrhosis or liver scarring. Based on the genomic data the team determined that celiac disease lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndromeall possible sources of gastrointestinal discomfort and erm violent excretionswere unlikely to have affected Beethoven. Furthermore Beethoven does not appear to have suffered lead poisoning previous analysis that suggested as much was based on a hair sample that did not belong to him. The composers death was almost certainly hastened by alcohol abuse. As noted by the researchers some of Beethovens contemporaries claimed that the composer drank in moderation but one friend allegedly claimed that in the last few years of his life Beethoven was drinking a liter of wine with lunch daily. There are metabolic biomarkers of chronic alcohol abuse that survive in hair particularly one called EtG wrote study lead author Tristan James Alexander Begg in an email to Gizmodo. Whether these biomarkers can be accurately analyzed with respect to chronic alcohol consumption in hair is a very big unknown and would likely entail a largescale study in order to validate such approaches explained Begg an archaeogeneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The team also compared Beethovens Y chromosome with five Y chromosomes from living descendants of Aert van Beethoven an ancestor of Ludwig who lived from 1535 to 1609. The team was able to reconstruct the Beethoven genetic patrilineage to about 1000 CE. But the Y chromosomes of the living men did not match those from the Beethoven hair samples to the researchers that indicated an extrapair paternitythat is an extramarital conceptionsomewhere between Aert van Beethoven and the birth of Ludwig seven generations later. That interloper provided the Y chromosome that eventually made its way into Ludwigs genetic code. Whether this means Beethoven himself was born from the extrapair paternity is undeterminable the researchers say. Similarly while the team was able to identity hepatitis B viral DNA in Beethovens hair they were not able to determine when or how the infection occurred. Hepatitis B causes inflammation of the liver and can be transmitted from mother to child through sexual interaction or during surgery with contaminated tools. We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk and an infection with hepatitis B virus Krause said. We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes. Hepatitis B is likely the most promising vein of future research Begg said. I would strongly advocate that additional locks of hair dating from different periods in Beethovens life undergo such analyses. While the results affirm some previously suspected conclusions they also raise new questions about the origins of Beethovens many illnesses. And of course perhaps the biggest mysterythe cause of his hearing lossremains just that.,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and genealogical history. Chief among them Beethoven had inherited genetic risk factors for liver diseases and was infected with hepatitis B taken alongside the composers alcohol consumption these likely contributed to his death at age 56. The teams research is published today in Current Biology. Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethovens health problems which famously include progressive hearing loss beginning in his mid to late20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818 said study coauthor Johannes Krause a biochemist specializing in ancient DNA at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany in a Cell Press release.,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and genealogical history.

The 55yearold German served eight months of his twoandahalfyear sentence for hiding 2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts. He was released in December and was subsequently deported from the UK. Im usually good in the fifth set  Ive won the first two sets Ive lost the next two and Im planning to win that he told 5 Live Breakfast. In a lengthy interview former world number one Becker said There was no handbook for dealing with fame and fortune after winning Wimbledon as a teenager Prison was brutal and a very different experience to what you see in the movies Hes a stronger better man after eight months in prison The full interview will be played on Saturdays 5 Live Breakfast show. Whoever says prison life isnt hard is lying The sixtime Grand Slam singles champion who was catapulted to stardom in 1985 when he won Wimbledon aged just 17 was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act in April last year. The case centred on Beckers bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than 3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca Spain. Speaking before the release of a new TV documentary about his life and career Boom! Boom! The World vs Boris Becker Becker said I dont think there was a handbook written for how to behave what to do and how to live your life when you win Wimbledon at 17. The fame and fortune after was very new. Obviously I never studied business I never studied finance and after my tennis career I made a couple of decisions probably badly advised but again it was my decision. Becker is the youngest ever champion of the mens singles at Wimbledon winning the 1985 title aged 17 After sentencing Becker spent the first weeks of his detention at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London before spending the majority of his sentence at Huntercombe Prison in Oxfordshire. Whoever says that prison life isnt hard and isnt difficult I think is lying the threetime Wimbledon champion said. I was surrounded by murderers by drug dealers by rapists by people smugglers by dangerous criminals. You fight every day for survival. Quickly you have to surround yourself with the tough boys as I would call it because you need protection. Becker said being a legendary tennis player counted for nothing while he was in prison. If you think youre better than everybody else then you lose he said. Inside it doesnt matter that I was a tennis player the only currency we have inside is our character and our personality. Thats it you have nothing else. You dont have any friends at first youre literally on your own and thats the hard part you have to really dig inside yourself about your qualities and your strengths but also your weaknesses. I miss London Following his release Becker was deported to Germany and will not be allowed to return to UK soil until October 2024. I miss London I really miss Wimbledon and I wont be going there this year he said Im fortunate that I can stand on my feet none of my partners have dropped me theyve welcomed me back home. When youre down and the last five six years were very difficult for me you truly find out whos with you and whos not with you. Speaking about how he has been received by people since his release he said Nobodys perfect including myself and Ive accepted all of that. Ive been out now for three and a half months and Im very humbled again by the reception Ive received from fans from people on the street from people who have followed the story a little bit. Becker has commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC The former BBC pundit says he has been in dialogue with the BBC about being part of its Wimbledon coverage in the future. Ive told them I cant come back next year Becker said. If Im allowed to go back I will make a phone call and ask if they want me back on the team I would certainly love to but its not my decision. Im a stronger better man Becker believes he has learned valuable lessons from his time in prison. I never thought at 17 Id be incarcerated at 54 he said. If anything it certainly humbled me it certainly made me realise that whether youre called Boris Becker or Paul Smith if you break the law you get convicted and you get incarcerated that goes for everybody. I never expected the good and I certainly didnt expect the bad but Im a survivor Im a tough cookie Ive taken the penalties Ive taken the incarceration but Ive also taken the glory and if anything this made me a stronger better man.

Published 20 March Image source Getty Images Image caption The 2003 invasion of Iraq toppled President Saddam Hussein On 20 March 2003 US and allied forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Husseins regime. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to international peace but most countries refused to support military action against it. Why did the US want to invade Iraq? In the Gulf War of 19901991 the US had led a multinational coalition which forced invading Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Afterwards the UN Security Council passed Resolution 687 ordering Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction WMDs  a term used to describe nuclear biological and chemical weapons and longrange ballistic missiles. In 1998 Iraq suspended cooperation with UN weapons inspectors and the US and UK responded with air strikes. After alQaedas 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington President George W Bushs administration started making plans to invade Iraq. President Bush claimed Saddam was continuing to stockpile and manufacture WMDs and that Iraq was part of an international axis of evil along with Iran and North Korea. In October 2002 the US Congress authorised the use of military force against Iraq. Many people in Washington believed that there was significant evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that it posed a genuine threat says Dr Leslie Vinjamuri director of the US and Americas Programme at Chatham House a foreign affairs think tank in London. In February 2003 thenUS Secretary of State Colin Powell asked the UN Security Council to give the goahead for military action against Iraq saying it was violating previous resolutions with its alleged WMD programme. However he did not persuade the Council. Most of its members wanted weapons inspectors from the UN and International Energy Authority  who had gone to Iraq in 2002  to carry out more work there to find evidence of WMDs. The US said it would not wait for the inspectors to report and assembled a coalition of the willing against Iraq. Who supported the war? Of the 30 countries in the coalition the UK Australia and Poland participated in the invasion. The UK sent 45000 troops Australia sent 2000 troops and Poland sent 194 special forces members. Kuwait allowed the invasion to be launched from its territory. Spain and Italy gave diplomatic support to the USled coalition along with several east European nations in the Vilnius Group who said they believed that Iraq had a WMD programme and was violating UN resolutions. What allegations did the US and UK make against Iraq? US Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN in 2003 that Iraq had mobile labs for producing biological weapons. However he acknowledged in 2004 that the evidence for this appears not to be... that solid. Image source Getty Images Image caption US Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destructions The UK government made public an intelligence dossier claiming that Iraqi missiles could be readied within 45 minutes to hit UK targets in the eastern Mediterranean. The UKs thenPrime Minister Tony Blair said it was beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein was continuing to produce WMD. The two countries relied heavily on the claims of two Iraqi defectors  a chemical engineer called Rafid Ahmed Alwan alJanabi and an intelligence officer called Maj Muhammad Harith  who said they had firsthand knowledge of Iraqs WMD programme. Both men later said they had fabricated their evidence because they wanted the allies to invade and oust Saddam. Who refused to support the war? Two neighbours of the US Canada and Mexico refused to support it. Germany and France two key US allies in Europe also refused support. French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said military intervention would be the worst possible solution. Turkey  a fellow Nato member and neighbour of Iraq  refused to let the US and allies use its airbases. Middle Eastern countries which had supported the US against Iraq in the 199091 Gulf War such as Saudi Arabia did not support its invasion in 2003. The Gulf Arab states thought the plan was crazy says Professor Gilbert Achcar an expert in Middle Eastern politics at University of London SOAS. They were worried about Iran getting control of Iraq after the fall of Saddams regime. What happened in the war? At dawn on 20 March 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom began with 295000 US and allied troops invading Iraq across its border with Kuwait. 70000 members of the Kurdish Peshmerga militia fought Iraqi forces in the north of the country. By May Iraqs army had been defeated and its regime overthrown. Saddam Hussein was later captured tried and executed. However no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. US troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011. America lost a lot of credibility from this war says Dr Karin von Hippel directorgeneral of the Royal United Services Institute think tank. You still hear people saying twenty years later why do we want to believe American intelligence?

An Army news release identified the soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division who were killed in the incident as Warrant Officer 1 Jeffrey Barnes 33 Cpl. Emilie Marie Eve Bolanos 23 Chief Warrant Officer 2 Zachary Esparza 36 Sgt. Isaacjohn Gayo 27 Staff Sgt. Joshua Gore 25 Warrant Officer 1 Aaron Healy 32 Staff Sgt. Taylor Mitchell 30 Chief Warrant Officer 2 Rusten Smith 32 and Sgt. David Solinas Jr. 23. This is a time of great sadness for the 101st Airborne Division. The loss of these Soldiers will reverberate through our formations for years to come Maj. Gen. JP McGee commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault said in a statement on Friday. Now is the time for grieving and healing. The whole division and this community stand behind the families and friends of our fallen Soldiers. The medical evacuation helicopters were conducting a routine training mission when they crashed at approximately 1000 pm local time in an open field across from a residential area. All nine of the service members aboard the two aircraft were killed in the accident. Lt. Col. Anthony Hoefler a spokesman for the 101st Airborne Division told CNN that earlier reports that a total of four helicopters were taking part in the training exercise were incorrect. He said in a statement Saturday that there were only two aircraft involved in the training flight at the time of the accident. There were other aircraft in the airspace conducting different training flights at the time of the accident which is why multiple aircraft were able to respond quickly to the accident site. Its still unclear what caused the crash a team from Fort Rucker Alabama is currently onsite and investigating the incident the Army said Friday. The nine soldiers who were killed came from all different backgrounds. Barnes an aeromedical evacuation pilot enlisted in the Army from Florida in 2010 going on to deploy to Afghanistan with the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade according to service records provided by the Army. Bolanos a UH60 helicopter repairer and air crew member born in the Philippines enlisted out of Texas in 2019 and in 2020 served for nine months in Germany as part of Atlantic Resolve. A native Texan Esparza enlisted out of Missouri in 2010 and had served as an instructor pilot for the brigade since October 2021. Gayo also born in the Philippines joined the Army in 2019 out of California. Gore joined the Army in 2015 and had served as a flight paramedic for the brigade since May 2022. Healy had been serving as an Aeromedical Evacuation Pilot for the brigade since 2022 after having joined the Army in 2010. Mitchell enlisted in 2014 and was also serving as a flight paramedic for the brigade. Smith from Florida joined the Army in 2012 he served as an instructor pilot in the brigade and had deployed to Afghanistan twice in addition to a ninemonth rotation in Germany in support of Atlantic Resolve. Solinas a flight paramedic joined the service in 2018. Wednesdays accident was the deadliest aviation training incident since 2015 when 11 service members were killed when a Black Hawk crashed off the coast of Florida.

The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories one in Texas the other in Germany which opened last spring and a lag between that increased production and sales. Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models the Model S and Model X in transit to Europe the Middle East and Africa as well as to the Asia Pacific region. But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78000 more cars than it has sold suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers. That 78000vehicle excess production is equal to 5 of the cars it has built. First quarter sales trailed production by 18000 vehicles less than the gap in third and fourth quarter of last year but still equal to 4 of the vehicles it built. Early this year we had a price adjustment. After that we actually generated a huge demand more than we can produce really Tom Zhu Teslas executive in charge of global production and sales said at Teslas investor day. And as Elon said as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you dont have to worry about demand. But some analysts said the hard numbers reported Sunday raises questions about the strength of demand for Tesla no matter how bullish the comments from Zhu and Musk. If it wasnt clear before it now is Tesla has a demand problem Gordon Johnson an analyst who is one of the biggest Tesla critics said in a note Monday. For four straight quarters Tesla has produced more cars than they have sold despite the fact that two of its plants are operating at 20 to 40 utilization and it shutdown its largest plant unexpectedly three times in the first quarter said Johnson said who said he believes Musk has a pathological problem with the truth. In short no matter what Elon Musk says Tesla has a seriousmajor demand problem said Johnson. The company reported it completed sales of 422875 vehicles in the quarter. Thats short of the forecast of 430000 vehicles from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Dan Ives tech analyst for Wedbush Securities said the consensus that Wall Street was looking for was deliveries of 421500 which would mean a very narrow beat for Tesla. But even Ives a bull on Tesla stock said the lower prices that Tesla got for cars in the quarter will mean tighter profit margins going forward. Tesla will report full first quarter financial results on April 19. The big question will be margins as cutting prices will have an impact on this front he said in a note to clients Sunday. First quarter production was up only 0.2 from the final three months of 2022 despite it efforts to ramp up production in Germany and Texas. Production and sales were up much more when compared to the first quarter of 2022 with production up 44 and deliveries up 36. But even that suggests that Tesla is below the 50 annual growth target it has set for the company long term. Shares of Tesla TSLA which fell 65 in 2022 for its worst annual performance ever closed Friday up 68 so far in 2023. Still that left shares off 41 from where they stood at the end of 2021. Shares were down more than 5 in midday trading Monday on the sales report.,New York CNN  Tesla reported a modest 4 rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. CNN  Tonight Jews around the world will gather around the seder table to celebrate Passover. They will recount the miraculous story of the Jewish peoples exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom. It is a timeless powerful story of faith hope and redemption that has inspired oppressed people everywhere for generations. President Joe Biden Adam SchultzUS Navy But Passover is more than just a recounting of the past. It is also a cautionary tale of the present and our future as a democracy. As Jews read from the Haggadah about how evil in every generation has tried to destroy them antisemitism is rising to record levels today. According to the FBI more than half of religious hate crimes in America in 2021 targeted Jews and were motivated by antisemitism. The AntiDefamation League similarly found that in 2022 antisemitic incidents in America reached their highest levels on record since it started tracking incidents more than 40 years ago. We see this evil across society. Terrorist attacks on synagogues. Bricks thrown through windows of Jewish businesses. Antisemitic flyers left on the front lawns of Jewish homes. Swastikas on cars and cemeteries. Antisemitic graffiti and acts in elementary middle and high schools. Jewish students harassed on college campuses. Jews wearing religious attire beaten and shot on streets. Failure to call out hate is complicityAnd we will not be silent. Joe Biden Antisemitic conspiracy theories rampant online. Antisemitic tropes treated as honest public debate. Celebrities spouting antisemitic hate. All of it  flagrant embraces of extremism in public life. These acts are unconscionable and despicable. They carry in them terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in human history. And theyre not only a strike against Jews theyre also a threat to other minority communities and a stain on the soul of our nation. To the Jewish community I want you to know that I see your fear your hurt and your concern that this venom is being normalized. I decided to run for President after I saw it in Charlottesville when neoNazis marched from the shadows spewing the same antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the 1930s. Rest assured that I am committed to the safety of the Jewish people. I stand with you. America stands with you. Under my presidency we continue to condemn antisemitism at every turn. Failure to call out hate is complicity. Silence is complicity. And we will not be silent. As the Passover holiday teaches our work starts with the sacred duty to remember. Last year I visited Israel once again to reaffirm Americas unshakeable commitment to its security. I returned to Yad Vashem to honor the 6 million murdered Jews to keep alive the truth and horror of the Holocaust and to remind us all of our shared responsibility to make real the promise of Never Again. It was a promise my father first instilled in me at our family dinner table educating my siblings and me about the horrors of the Shoah. Its a lesson Ive passed on to my own children and grandchildren by taking them to Dachau a concentration camp in Nazi Germany to understand for themselves the depths of this evil and the culpability of indifference. And its a message that Jill and I have continued along with Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff by bringing Holocaust survivors to the White House and to the State of the Union  so the entire nation bears witness. But Passover teaches that remembering is not enough we must also speak out. The word Haggadah means telling  and it reminds us of our moral obligation to state clearly and forcefully that this scourge of antisemitism must stop. Thats why I appointed Deborah Lipstadt  a Holocaust expert  as our first Ambassadorlevel Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat AntiSemitism around the world. The Second Gentleman  the first Jewish spouse of a vice president in our history  has also been a leading voice against antisemitism and visited Poland and Germany to promote Holocaust awareness. And I hosted the first United We Stand Summit at the White House convening governmental and nongovernmental leaders from across the country to declare that hatefueled violence can have no safe harbor in America. But as we speak out we must also act. Central to the seder are actions rituals and reenactments that help us feel the exodus experience and collectively reinforce the truth that words alone are insufficient. Thats why I signed a bipartisan law to help state and local law enforcement better identify and respond to hate crimes. And the Justice Department has made combating hate crimes one of its top priorities. My administration also secured the largestever increase in funding for the physical security of nonprofits including synagogues Jewish community centers and Jewish day schools. Because nobody should have to fear walking down the street wearing symbols of their faith. Well also be releasing the firstever national strategy to counter antisemitism which will outline comprehensive actions the federal government will undertake and that reflects input from over a thousand Jewish community stakeholders faith and civil rights leaders state and local officials and more. Taking action also means reinforcing that Jewish culture and values are essential to the fabric of America. Thats why we hosted the first High Holiday reception at the White House and lit the first permanent White House Hanukkah menorah in our nations history. From darkness we find joy and hope and light. Joe Biden But government alone cannot root out antisemitism and hate. All Americans including businesses and community leaders educators students athletes entertainers and influencers must help confront bigotry in all its forms. We must each do our part to create a culture of respect in our workplaces in our schools on our social media and in our homes. Because hate never goes away it only hides until it is given just a little oxygen. And it is our obligation to ensure that hate doesnt grow or become normalized. It is our duty to preserve and protect the sacred ideals enshrined in our Constitution religious freedom equality dignity and respect. That is the promise of America. And that is the story of Passover  a story of redemption resilience and unity. A story of people coming together with a shared faith a shared hope for a better tomorrow and a shared resolve to reach the Promised Land. We were reminded of this enduring story in the aftermath of the hostagetaking at a synagogue in Colleyville Texas last year. Hate did not pierce a communitys goodness and grace. Heroic law enforcement officials were joined by local faith leaders including an imam and Baptist minister who offered their help. The nearby Catholic Church opened its doors to the hostages families. At sunset a group of Muslim women friends of the rabbis wife arrived with the rabbis favorite foods. They hugged and wept and held strong together. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Thats the America that I know. From darkness we find joy and hope and light. Rather than driving us apart faith can move us together. Not just faith in a higher power but faith to see each other as we should  as fellow human beings. As we celebrate Passover let us reflect that like the four children in the Haggadah despite our differences we sit at the same table as one people one nation one America. Let us join hands across faiths races and backgrounds to make clear that evil will not win hate will not prevail and antisemitism will not be the story of our time. Let us remember speak out and act to restore the soul of America together.,Editors Note Joe Biden is President of the United States. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

Four US troops at the coalition base near al Hasakah that was attacked on March 23 by a suspected Iranian drone and two service members at Mission Support Site Green Village attacked on March 24 have been identified as having brain injuries in screening since the attacks Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Thursday. As standard procedure all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injuries he said. So these additional injuries were identified during postattack medical screenings. Those screenings are ongoing he added. One of the service members has been transferred to Baghdad for further treatment a US defense official familiar with the matter told CNN noting that Baghdad has more advanced treatment options and better specialists than remaining on base in Syria. The other five US service members who have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries are being treated at their facilities. The news comes a week after the suspected Iranian drone struck a facility housing US personnel killing an American contractor and wounding five service members. The US responded with precision air strikes on facilities associated with Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps which Ryder said Thursday killed eight militants. The US service members who were wounded in the attacks last week Ryder said all are in stable condition. Of the five injured in the original attack on March 23 one other service member is receiving treatment in Germany while two others and a contractor are being treated in Iraq and two have returned to duty. The service member who was injured in attacks on March 24 is also receiving medical care and is in stable condition Ryder said. In 2020 more than 100 service members were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries after an Iranian missile attack on the al Asad military base in Iraq. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at the time that symptoms take time to manifest. Its not an immediate thing necessarily  some cases it is some cases its not he said. So we continue to screen. Mild traumatic brain injuries or concussion is one of the most common forms of TBI among service members. But TBIs can also be debilitating veterans described symptoms of dizziness confusion headaches and irritability after sustaining TBIs as well as changes in personality and balance issues. On Thursday Ryder reiterated US officials remarks last week that the US will take all necessary measures to defend our troops and our interests overseas. We do not seek conflict with Iran he said but we will always protect our people.

Ferencz fought in Europe during the Second World War and helped liberate several concentration camps before turning to the courtroom. At 27 he was named Chief Prosecutor for Nurembergs Einsatzgruppen trial trying 22 Nazis for crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg trials were held by the Allies after Germany was defeated in 1945 with an aim to bring Nazis to justice for crimes committed during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen trial was his first court case but the evidence which Ferencz discovered perfectly recorded and documented in Nazi headquarters allowed him to successfully rest the case in only two days. The men on trial commanded Hitlers roaming SS extermination squads killing between them an estimated one million victims. Ferencz at his home in Delray Beach Florida in 2016. Brooks KraftGetty Images In his opening statement he said Vengeance is not our goal. Nor do we seek merely a just retribution. We ask this court to affirm by international penal action mans right to live in peace and dignity regardless of his race or creed. The case we present is a plea to humanity. All the defendents were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is often considered the biggest murder trials in history. Ferencz was the first prosecutor to use the term genocide in a court of law introducing the term in his opening statement So here the killing of defenseless civilians during a war may be a war crime but the same killings are part of another crime a graver one if you will genocide or a crime against humanity. This is the distinction we make in our pleading. It is real and most significant. For Ferencz law not war was more than a motto it was his lifes mission. For decades he advocated the establishment of an International Criminal Court and is considered one of the ICCs founding fathers. In 2011 he delivered the closing statement for the prosecution at the ICCs first trial saying What makes this Court so distinctive is its primary goal to deter crimes before they take place by letting wrongdoers know in advance that they will be called to account by an impartial International Criminal Court. Ferencz speaking with CNNs Christiane Amanpour. In January Ferencz was awarded the US Congressional Gold Medal but was unable to attend the ceremony due to his declining health. In an interview with CNNs Christiane Amanpour last year Ferencz said he was heartbroken by the war in Ukraine. To see it happening again very similar kids being shot homes being blown up it pains me to see that we have learned so little from the Holocaust and from the trials he said. Ferencz fought for justice his entire life saying to let the world continue to use war as an instrument of persuasion is so stupid and so incredible that I simply cant stop doing it at the age of 103. He added that he was not discouraged and to never give up never give up never give up.

Get the latest news in aviation food and drink where to stay and other travel developments. CNN  Europe and Asia dominate a new list of the worlds best cities for public transit. Time Out the publisher of global city guides polled 20000 people in 50 cities to find out how they feel about their local mass transit systems. The top ten  out of 19 total cities listed  is entirely comprised of destinations in Asia and Europe with Berlin landing in the number one spot. The highest entry from North America is New York City at number 15 and no other continents are represented  better luck next year Buenos Aires Doha and Melbourne. While only residents were surveyed this list is also useful for travelers as they decide where to go next and how best to get around. What makes for great transit? Public transit is a broad term that includes subways aboveground trains buses trams and even ferries. To make it onto Time Outs list at least 80 of polled residents had to agree that its easy to get around their city via mass transportation. According to Time Outs data a whopping 97 of Berliners had positive things to say about their citys mass transit infrastructure praising the network for being reliable comfortable and safe. But there are other factors to consider when traveling by train or bus  namely aesthetics. Stockholm in seventh place was one of the cities praised for its beautiful subway stations. Many of its Tunnelbana stations feature colorful and dramatic designs earning it the nickname the worlds longest art exhibit. Its not only the stations themselves that are known for good looks. Hong Kongs famous aboveground trains known locally as ding dings for the sound they make even have their own Pantone color HK Tram Green. These days the trams appear in a range of colors and designs but the iconic color dates from the postWorld War II era when the British military had a surplus of green paint. In addition to its highlyrated mass transit Singapores Changi airport regularly wins praise. FotoGraphicAdobe Stock Asian standouts Seven of the top 19 cities hailed for their mass transit systems are in Asia. Most are in east Asia with Singapore Shanghai and Taipei all picking up accolades but Mumbai squeaked in at 19th place. The Indian megacity recently introduced Chalo Pay a new app that makes it easier to book and pay for transit tickets without needing to carry cash. But it was Tokyo in third place that had the highest showing for the continent. The citys mass transit was applauded for being wellmaintained efficient and easy to navigate even for nonJapanese speakers. 92 percent of Taipei residents polled by Time Out said their citys transit was easy to use. SimonAdobe Stock European stars Six of the top 19 cities were in Europe with an additional two  London and Edinburgh  in the UK. Several of these cities won praise for having one unified payment system to cover a variety of forms of transit. In Copenhagen a regular commute can include water taxis that whisk travelers across the harbor while 10place Amsterdam makes it seamless to transfer between buses trains and trams. Perhaps its not a coincidence that both of these cities also appear on CNNs list of the worlds best cities for exploring by bicycle. Sustainability initiatives in the European Union mean that many metropolitan areas offer incentives to reduce car traffic. Whether you travel by tram train or bicycle its a way to visit major tourist attractions while reducing your carbon footprint. The worlds best cities for public transit 1. Berlin Germany 2.

Get the latest news in aviation food and drink where to stay and other travel developments. CNN  Theres cause for optimism in the latest report on world happiness. For one benevolence is about 25 higher than it was prepandemic. Benevolence to others especially the helping of strangers which went up dramatically in 2021 stayed high in 2022 John Helliwell one of the authors of the World Happiness Report said in an interview with CNN. And global happiness has not taken a hit in the three years of the Covid19 pandemic. Life evaluations from 2020 to 2022 have been remarkably resilient the report says with global averages basically in line with the three years preceding the pandemic. Even during these difficult years positive emotions have remained twice as prevalent as negative ones and feelings of positive social support twice as strong as those of loneliness Helliwell said in a news release. The report which is a publication of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network draws on global survey data from people in more than 150 countries. Countries are ranked on happiness based on their average life evaluations over the three preceding years in this case 2020 to 2022. The report which was released on Monday identifies the happiest nations those at the very bottom of the happiness scale and everything in between plus the factors that tend to lead to greater happiness. March 20 is the International Day of Happiness a day designated by the United Nations thats marking its 10th anniversary in 2023. Finland where Senate Square in Helsinki is pictured is No. 1 for happiness for the sixth year in a row. espiegleAdobe Stock Sixyear winning streak for worlds happiest nation For the sixth year in a row Finland is the worlds happiest country according to World Happiness Report rankings based largely on life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll. The Nordic country and its neighbors Denmark Iceland Sweden and Norway all score very well on the measures the report uses to explain its findings healthy life expectancy GDP per capita social support low corruption generosity in a community where people look after each other and freedom to make key life decisions. But since we cant all move to Finland is there something other societies can learn from these rankings? Is it are they doing things that we wish wed seen before and we can start doing? Or is it something unique about their climate and history that make them different? And fortunately at least from my perspective the answer is the former said Helliwell who is a professor emeritus at the Vancouver School of Economics University of British Columbia. Taking a holistic view of the wellbeing of all the components of a society and its members makes for better life evaluations and happier countries. The objective of every institution should be to contribute what it can to human wellbeing the report says which includes accounting for future generations and preserving basic human rights. Israel moves up to No. 4 this year from its No. 9 ranking last year. The Netherlands No. 5 Switzerland No. 8 Luxembourg No. 9 and New Zealand No. 10 round out the top 10. Australia No. 12 Canada No. 13 Ireland No. 14 the United States No. 15 and the United Kingdom No. 19 all made it into the top 20. Lithuania with the main square in Kaunas pictured made it into the top 20 in the latest World Happiness Report. Subodh AgnihotriiStockphotoGetty Images While the same countries tend to appear in the top 20 year after year theres a new entrant this year Lithuania. The Baltic nation has been climbing steadily over the past six years from No. 52 in 2017 to No. 20 on the latest list. And the other Baltic countries Estonia No. 31 and Latvia No. 41 have been climbing in the ranks too. Its essentially the same story thats playing out in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe Helliwell said. Countries in those regions probably have normalized that post1990 transition and are feeling more solid in their new identity as the years pass he said. France dropped out of the top 20 to No. 21 in this years report. Nations ranked lower for happiness At the very bottom of the list is Afghanistan at No. 137. Lebanon is one rank above at No. 136. Average life evaluations in these countries are more than five points lower on a scale from 0 to 10 than in the 10 happiest countries. Russias invasion of Ukraine put both countries very much in the global spotlight as the 2022 report was released. So where do these two nations stand according to the latest surveys? Wellbeing in Ukraine has definitely taken a hit but despite the magnitude of suffering and damage in Ukraine life evaluations in September 2022 remained higher than in the aftermath of the 2014 annexation supported now by a stronger sense of common purpose benevolence and trust in Ukrainian leadership the report says. Confidence in their governments grew in both countries in 2022 the survey says but much more in Ukraine than in Russia. And Ukrainian support for the leadership in Russia fell to zero. In this years rankings Russia is No. 70 and Ukraine is No. 92. Looking forward The disruptions of the pandemic have spurred a lot of reflection. People are rethinking their life objectives Helliwell said. Theyre saying Im going back but what am I going back to? What do I want to go back to? How do I want to spend the rest of my life? Hes hoping this move towards thinking about values and other people more explicitly will affect not just factors such as which jobs or schools people choose but also how they operate within those environments. It isnt really about the grades or the salary its about cooperating with other people in a useful way. And of course thats useful for the world but the whole point of this happiness research is that its also good for the people doing it. In other words you do end up feeling better about yourself if youre actually looking after other people rather than number one. Worlds happiest countries for 2023 1. Finland 2. Denmark 3. Iceland 4.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/08/us/christianity-decline-easter-blake-cec/index.html,Analysis Predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature,Pundits in the US have been warning that Christianity is on the decline citing shrinking church membership and polls showing that fewer Americans call themselves Christians But some scholars say help is on the way,The cross and the empty tomb Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrecti 12068 chars,CNN  The cross and the empty tomb. Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story. One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrection and the claim that death does not have the final word on him or his followers. As millions of Americans celebrate the holiest day in the Christian calendar on Sunday most will hear some variation of this Easter message  finding new life in unforeseen places. But that message could also describe a surprising prediction about the future of Christianity in the US. For years church leaders and commentators have warned that Christianity is dying in America. They say the American church is poised to follow the path of churches in Western Europe soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews shuttered church buildings converted into skate parts and nightclubs and a secularized society where one theologian said Christianity as a norm is probably gone for good  or at least for the next 100 years. Yet when CNN asked some of the nations top religion scholars and historians recently about the future of Christianity in the US they had a different message. They said the American church is poised to find new life for one major reason Waves of Christians are migrating to the US. And they said the biggest challenge to Christianitys future in America is not declining numbers but the churchs ability to adapt to this migration. Joseph P. Slaughter a historian and assistant professor of religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut says people have been predicting the extinction of Christianity in the US for over two centuries and it hasnt happened yet. A sparsely attended Good Friday mass in Cologne Germany on April 2 2021. Ina FassbenderAFPGetty Images He pointed to Thomas Jefferson one of the nations founding fathers who predicted in the 1820s that Christianity would be replaced in the US by a more enlightened form of religion that rejected Jesus divinity and belief in miracles. Instead Jeffersons prophecy was followed by a series of revivals including the Second Great Awakening which swept across America and reasserted Christianity as a dominant force in American life. Id never bet against American Christianity  particularly evangelicalism Slaughter says and its ability to adapt and remain a significant shaper of the American society. Whats happening in Europe is the churchs nightmare scenario If one only looks at the numbers Slaughters optimism seems misguided. Virtually every recent poll about Christianity in America has been brutal for its followers. About 64 of Americans call themselves Christian today. That might sound like a lot but 50 years ago that number was 90 according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070. The Covid19 pandemic also hurt the church in America. Church attendance has rebounded recently but remains slightly below prepandemic levels. A 2021 Gallup poll revealed another grim number for Christians church membership in the US has fallen below 50 for the first time. In addition a cascade of headlines in recent years have stained the churchs reputation including sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention the spread of White Christian nationalism and the perception that the church oppresses marginalized groups such as LGBTQ people. Church leaders in the US also have fretted about the rise of nones. These are people who describe themselves as atheists agnostics or nothing in particular when asked their religious identity. The ascent of nones will transform the countrys religious and political landscape says Tina Wray a professor of religious and theological studies at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. About 30 of Americans now call themselves nones. A billboard in 2010 in Oklahoma City paid for by a local atheists group called Coalition of Reason. Sue OgrockiAP The interest of the nones will soon outweigh those of the religious right in just a matter of years Wray says. Nones are going to vote as a bloc and theyre going to be pretty powerful. White evangelicals will eventually be eclipsed by the unaffiliated. Wray says those who are optimistic about the future of the American church underestimate how quickly Christianity can lose its influence even in a place where it once thrived. She cites whats happened in the Republic of Ireland an overwhelmingly Catholic country. The Catholic Church prohibits divorce and was once so powerful in Ireland that the country wouldnt legally grant its citizens the legal right to a divorce until 1995 says Wray author of What the Bible Really Tells Us The Essential Guide to Biblical Literacy. But Wray adds that she recently traveled to Ireland and discovered many of its citizens have left the religion. Churches are being closed and turned into apartment buildings she says. People who went to mass everyday stopped going she says. Theres this cultural Catholic identity but as far as practicing their faith its just disappearing. So within a generation thats all it took. Its just shocking. Why the American churchs future may be different than Europes Most of the religious scholars CNN spoke to said the American church may find salvation in another demographic trend the booming of Christianity in what is called the Global South the regions encompassing Latin America Africa and Asia. The worlds largest megachurch for example is not in the US. Its in South Korea. The Yoido Full Gospel Church has a weekly attendance of about 600000 members. Perry Hamalis spent time as a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea where he personally witnessed the vitality of the Christian church in the Global South. He says the church is not perceived in South Korea as an instrument of oppression but one of liberation. When South Korea was colonized by the Japanese in the early 20th century the church aligned with Koreans to protest. Christianity was looked at not as a religion of empire and of the colonizers but as the religion of the anticolonial movement and of prodemocracy says Hamalis a religion professor at North Central College in Illinois. The US has more immigrants than any other country. People from Latin America and Asia now make up the overwhelming majority of immigrants to the US and many are bringing their religious fervor with them. A service on Christmas Day 2022 at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul South Korea. Chung SungJunGetty Images This migration is known as the Browning of America a phrase describing a demographic shift that is expected to make White people the minority in the US by 2045. Those who predict that the church in America will collapse often overlook how the migration of Global South Christians to America will revitalize the countrys religious landscape scholars say. Christianity could rebound in America if White Christians embrace this one change they say. Tish Harrison Warren a New York Times columnist pointed out recently that Latino evangelicals are now the fastestgrowing group of evangelicals in the US. We cannot assume that America will become more secular so long as the future of America is less white Warren wrote. The influx of Black and brown Christians from places like Latin America and Asia collides with another trend a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement that insists incorrectly that the US was founded as a White Christian nation. It is hostile to nonWhite immigrants. Some churches may discover that Jesus command to welcome the stranger collides with their definition of patriotism Hamalis says. Many congregations dont realize how much of their Christian identity is wrapped up with a kind of Christian nationalist narrative Hamalis says. Theres nothing wrong with loving ones country but from a Christian perspective that ought to always be secondary to the mission of building the body of Christ and witnessing to the Gospel in the world. How Christianity could reestablish its dominance There are other factors hiding in plain sight that point to the continued vitality of Christianity others say. For one declining church membership doesnt automatically translate into declining influence. Consider some recent landmark events. White evangelicals played a critical role in getting former President Trump elected. Conservative Christian groups played a crucial role in the recent passage of state laws limiting LGBTQ rights. And the Supreme Courts decision last year to overturn Roe vs. Wade was a massive victory for many conservative Christians. And atheism remains a taboo in American politics. American voters still prefer candidates  including presidents Barack Obama Donald Trump and Joe Biden  who profess or evoke Christian beliefs. Christianity still holds a lot of capital in this country says Lee M. Jefferson an associate professor of religion at Centre College in Kentucky. There has always been a popular notion that a religious communitys strength or influence is connected to numbers and attendance Jefferson says. Even if there is ample space in cathedrals Christianity will still hold some strong relevance in different landscapes in the US. Even the rise of the nones the growing number of Americans who say they dont care about religion is not as much of a threat to the church as initial reports suggest scholars say. A growing number of Americans may no longer identify as Christian but many still care about spirituality says Hans Gustafson author of Everyday Wisdom Interreligious Studies for a Pluralistic World. Maria Antonetty foreground joins others in a Spanish Easter service at the Primitive Christian Church in New York City on April 12 2009. Tina FinebergAP Just because more Americans are disaffiliating with institutionalized religion  most notably Christian traditions  this does not always mean that people are becoming less religious says Gustafson director of the Jay Phillips Center for Interreligious Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. Many still practice spirituality prayer meditation and sometimes even regularly attend religious houses of worship he says. Among Americans with no religious affiliation some still pray daily and say religion is very important in their lives Gustafson says. Evangelicals at an inflection point not seen in 100 years reverend says 2022 0934  Source CNN He cites a surprising finding from a 2018 Pew Research Center study of religion in Western Europe. The study found that nones in the US are much more likely to pray and believe in God than their European counterparts said Neha Sahgal a vice president of research at Pew. In fact by some of these standard measures of religious commitment American nones are as religious as  or even more religious than  Christians in several European countries including France Germany and the UK Sahgal wrote. Why the Easter message offers a note of hope Despite the optimism of many religious scholars the future of Christianity in America still seems uncertain. Poll numbers about the decline of religiousness in the US cannot be ignored along with something more intangible the frailties of human nature. What if the US enters another xenophobic period and limits migration from nonWhite Christians? What if progressive Christians prove unwilling to align with nonWhite immigrants who tend to be more conservative on issues of sexuality and gender? A woven crown of thorns depicting the one placed on the head of Jesus before his crucifixion at Transfiguration Of Our Lord Ukrainian Catholic Church in Shamokin Pennsylvania. Carolyn KasterAP And what if some Christians still cling to the belief that America is supposed to be a White Christian nation even if that assumption causes them to close their church doors to nonWhite immigrants who could be their salvation? If that happens an Easter morning symbol in American churches wont just be an empty tomb but empty pews. But Hamalis the religion professor who saw Christianity boom in South Korea says Christians who fear that kind of future can take solace in the Easter message. From a Christian perspective theres nothing to fear because even death has been conquered Hamalis says. When we are liberated from that fear we can embrace the person whos different from us who speaks a different language or comes from a different culture. We can put ourselves out there in a way that we cant if were just afraid. He and other scholars envision a vibrant future for Christianity in the US thats shared by Warren the New York Times columnist The future of American Christianity is neither white evangelicalism nor white progressivism Warren wrote. The future of American Christianity now appears to be a multiethnic community that is largely led by immigrants of the children of immigrants. If the American church can embrace this future and reverse its shrinking membership it will have experienced its own resurrection.

https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/we-all-know-tesla-leads-the-ev-sales-charts-hows-everyone-else-doing/,Other than Tesla which car companies are selling lots of EVs,As automakers report Q1 sales we take a look at the numbers,Enlarge With a starting price of 26500 its no surprise that Chevrolet has sold a lot of Bolt EVs this year 64 with As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been report 3104 chars,As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been reporting their sales numbers. Tesla which we covered on Monday is far and away the leader when it comes to electric vehicle sales in the US. But as more and more automakers are bringing new EVs to market Teslas market share is eroding from 72 percent at the beginning of last year to 54 percent nowand it may fall to less than 50 percent over the next few weeks. Which of those other automakers are managing to move metal? We took a look through the Q1 sales announcements to get an idea. While most automakers have published their Q1 2023 sales this is not a universal list. In particular Porsche MercedesBenz Lucid and Genesis have yet to reveal those numbers as of April 5. And the manufacturers dont all break out data in the same way either lumping all EVs together looking at you General Motors or grouping different powertrains together as is the case with the Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona. Its also helpful to remember that other than Tesla Rivian and Lucid all the other automakers have product lines other than battery EVs so such a company probably isnt going out of business next week because it only sold 3000 EVs in three months. Supply chains still arent back to what was considered normal prepandemic and its worth remembering that in most cases these are global products. There are severe penalties for automakers who dont sell enough EVs in Europe and China unlike here in the US. So in cases of finite supply those markets will receive priority when it comes to deliveriesevery EV you sell in the US is an EV you cant sell in Germany after all. Advertisement General Motors is best of the rest General Motors had a good Q1 this year selling more than 20000 EVs according to a press release that does not provide any more granularity to that figure. But a little digging reveals that the vast majority of these were Bolt EV and Bolt EUV sales with 19700 vehicles finding homes in the first three months of 2023. Thats up from 358 for Q1 2022 when the cars were taken off the market for some time due to a battery manufacturing defect. Cadillac has delivered almost a thousand Lyriq SUVs so far this year but the same cannot be said for the GMC Hummer EV. Thats due to a production issue that shut down production of the Hummer from last October until the end of January. The BrightDrop Zevo 600 delivery van was also affected by that recallstop sale but BrightDrop says it has started shipping the first 500 vans it built this year. Next up is Ford which sold 10866 battery EVs in Q1 an increase of 41 percent year on year. Just under half of those sales were of the F150 Lightning pickup truckFord says its on track to reach a production rate of 150000 Lightnings a year in 2023. The company hasnt given us a breakout of Mustang MachE and ETransit sales but it reported that ETransit sales were up 62.7 percent and that MachE sales were down reflecting downtime at the plant for changes to increase production.,As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been reporting their sales numbers.

Berlin has been in talks with the European Commission over the past weeks about allowing registrations of cars running on synthetic fuels beyond the 2035 deadline for sales of CO2emitting cars agreed by European Union countries last year. A vote on the ban got delayed early this month by Germanys lastminute objections. The original law would effectively ban registration of combustion engine cars after 2035 but Germany seeks an exemption for cars that run exclusively on climateneutral efuel and legal assurances from the Commission. Reuters reported earlier this week that the European Commission sought to break the impasse with a new draft plan to allow sales of such combustionengine cars after 2035. In a letter to the Commission seen by Reuters on Friday Germanys transport ministry welcomed the EU executives proposals but asked for legislation to ensure its implementation. Berlins demand for an exemption had now been answered by the EU Commission with a letter that makes me optimistic German Transport Minister Volker Wissing told a news conference on Friday. There are still questions to be answered. Were not fully in agreement yet he added. The minister and his FDP party argue that combustion engine technology in which Germany is a leader should continue to be available to offer people more choices for carbonneutral mobility in the future. To ban this technology now makes no sense. Because multiple offers create more and more competition and better prices for citizens Wissing said. Speaking in Brussels on Friday German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said he expected an agreement to be reached soon. Separately Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he believed the dispute had now been resolved and the issue should be settled on Tuesday. EU energy ministers will meet in Brussels on Tuesday and have a chance to sign off on the law. The next opportunity would come at the next scheduled meeting of EU countries ministers in late April.

Ozil made 645 appearances for club and country in which he scored 114 goals and had 222 assists. He began his senior career with Schalke 04 in Germany before moving to Werder Bremen.

Ozil scored 23 international goals in his 92 matches for Germany. We all at the national team wish him and his family all the best for his time after his career Flick said. Ozil joined Turkish side Fenerbahce in 2021 after Arsenal terminated his contract and then moved to Istanbul Basaksehir less than a year later. It has been an amazing journey filled with unforgettable moments and emotions he added.

Securing our skilled labour base is one of Germanys biggest economic tasks for the coming decades Labour Minister Hubertus Heil said. The number of job vacancies in 2022 was at a record high of close to 2 million according to the ministry. One of the reforms is a new immigration law that aims to address key hurdles for migrants to Germany particularly for those coming from outside the European Union. With this we are laying the foundation for a new start in migration policy Finance Minister Christian Lindner tweeted after the cabinet approved the reforms. Anyone who can contribute to the countrys economic success as a skilled worker is welcome. The draft law seen by Reuters says the reform could increase the number of workers from countries outside the EU by 60000 people a year. If people bring professional experience or personal potential with them we will make it possible for them to gain a foothold in our labour market Germanys Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said. It offers foreign workers three pathways to enter the country. The first one requires a professional or university degree recognised in Germany and an employment contract. The second requires a minimum of two years of experience working in a relevant sector and a degree or vocational training. The third is a new opportunity card for individuals who do not have a job offer but have the potential to find work. The opportunity card follows a pointsbased system that takes into account qualifications language skills professional experience connection to Germany and age. The draft contains a number of innovative and sensible ideas but it is not farreaching enough to do justice to the problem we are facing migration expert Herbert Bruecker told Reuters. He said the requirements of the opportunity card were too complex just for a temporary visa to look for work. The cabinet also approved an education law that entitles young people to paid offthejob training. Germanys Federal Labour Agency will pay up to 67 of the net salary for the duration of the training. The cabinet also decided to extend regulations for jobseekers from Albania BosniaHerzegovina Kosovo the Republic of Northern Macedonia Montenegro and Serbia which were previously expected to expire at the end of the year. Germany will be able to recruit up to 50000 workers annually from these countries. Under this regulation Germany had previously been able to recruit 25000 workers per year. Bruecker welcomed this extension noting that employment rates among these immigrants were between 97 and 98 three to five years after moving to Germany. The scheme is a complete success and it should be extended to other countries Bruecker said.

The coaches analysed things well they showed where the mistakes were at the World Cup. We have discussed many things and hope to show them to you in the next two matches. Germany fourtime World Cup winners and threetime European champions have crashed out early in their three most recent tournaments including Euro 2020 in 2021 where they lost to England in the last 16.

There he met German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock from the Greens party junior partner in the countrys threeway coalition as well as business leaders academics and civil society representatives. Today we friends and partners we are looking forwards  and thats why we are starting this state visit very consciously with a topic that is decisive for our future on this planet said Steinmeier. He said he was grateful that Charles had become involved in these issues early on. We also benefit from your conviction today your Majesty said Steinmeier. Charles will address the German lower house of parliament the Bundestag on Thursday in Berlin and meet some of the Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Germany from Russias invasion of their homeland. We are feeling just how deep our connection is especially in these times Steinmeier said in his speech at the banquet. Germany and the United Kingdom are today also militarily the two biggest supporters of Ukraine in Europe. The German president gifted Charles a photo of his first visit to Germany as a young child in 1962 with his father the late Prince Philip to visit relatives. Charles has visited Germany on more than 40 occasions as prince including 28 previous official visits. The British government makes the ultimate decision on such state visits which form part of its use of the monarchys soft power. As such the trip was a clear sign of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks push to reset relations with Europe said Anand Menon director of academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe. However any warmer relations with Europe brought about by the visit could cool if other postBrexit issues flare up.

The EUs executive European Commission is due on April 18 to set out draft reforms to rules for handling stricken banks. It comes at a time of heightened sensitivity in the sector following UBS shotgun merger with Credit Suisse and the collapses of several U.S. banks including Silicon Valley Bank. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in a letter to the European Commission and the Eurogroup that the EU executive should respect the clear agreement made in June last year to preserve the framework for socalled Institutional Protection Schemes. From what I have now learned... this will not be the case Lindner said. An EU official said the Eurogroup asked the commission to strengthen and harmonise rules governing the use of national deposit guarantee schemes funds when a bank is in trouble. The Commission has consulted extensively member states and stakeholders before finalising the proposal. It will be a balanced proposal taking into account the specificities of national banking models and a useful reform on the path towards completing the Banking Union the EU official said. The schemes link banks in a national network allowing a struggling lender to get financial aid from the schemes other members forming part of a countrys protections for bank depositors. Participating banks pay into the network and benefit from reductions in some capital and liquidity requirements. Such schemes have been set up in Germany Austria Italy Spain and Poland. CARVE OUT Lindner said the commissions current plans would introduce a number of new and significant restrictions on IPS schemes by treating them like deposit guarantee schemes. Other elements in the draft plans such as the very broad scope of the rules would lead to very difficult negotiations Lindner said. A clear and precise carveout for IPS from newly introduced restrictions would be the easiest and cleanest way to respect last years agreement not to tamper with IPS Lindner said. My team will provide concrete drafting suggestions for such a carve out to your colleagues Lindner told EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness in the letter. A report for the European Parliament last year said IPS represents a central and substantial component of depositor protections in Germany. But there are questions over whether banks in an IPS pay enough into an EU central bank rescue fund and whether it is clear which authority is in charge if a lender in a scheme is failing the report said.

While European parliamentarians disagree over the content and reach of the EU AI Act some regulators are finding that existing tools such as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR that gives users control over their personal information can apply to the rapidly emerging category of generative AI companies. Generative AI such as OpenAIs ChatGPT relies on algorithms to generate remarkably human responses to text queries based on analyzing large volumes of data some of which may be owned by internet users. The Italian agency also known as Garante accused Microsoft Corpbacked MSFT.O OpenAI of failing to check the age of ChatGPT users and the absence of any legal basis that justifies the massive collection and storage of personal data to train the chatbot. The points they raise are fundamental and show that GDPR does offer tools for the regulators to be involved and engaged into shaping the future of AI said Dessislava Savova partner at law firm Clifford Chance. Privacy regulators in France and Ireland have reached out to counterparts in Italy to find out more about the basis of the ban. Germany could follow in Italys footsteps by blocking ChatGPT over data security concerns the German commissioner for data protection told the Handelsblatt newspaper. We are following up with the Italian regulator said a spokesperson for Irelands Data Protection Commissioner. We will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities in relation to this matter. The privacy regulator in Sweden however said it had no plan to ban ChatGPT nor was it in contact with the Italian watchdog. Spains regulator said it had not received any complaint about ChatGPT but did not rule out a future investigation. Italys Garante like other privacy regulators is independent of the government and was also among the first to formally warn Chineseowned TikTok about breaching of existing European Union privacy rules. While the privacy commissioners favour more regulation the governments are more lenient. Italys deputy prime minister has criticized its own regulators decision by calling it excessive and a German government spokesman said a ban of ChatGPT would not be necessary. The Italian authoritys move last week was aimed at starting a dialogue with the company to address the issues raised over ChatGPTs compliance to EU data protection rules and not to ban the tool a source familiar with the matter said. OpenAI has not responded to regulators over the weekend the source said. Meanwhile OpenAI has taken ChatGPT offline in Italy on Friday. It did not respond to questions about other European regulators looking into potential violation in their countries. It has no offices in the European Union. OpenAI whose artificial intelligence platform took the world by storm after its launch in November said on Friday it actively works to reduce personal data in training its AI systems. The Italian investigation into OpenAI was launched after a ninehour cyber security breach last month led to people being shown excerpts of other users ChatGPT conversations and their financial information. Italy is the first Western country to take action against a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. While the Italian regulator has only singled out ChatGPT so far because of its popularity other AI platforms such as Google Incs GOOGL.O Bard might be questioned too several experts said. Unlike ChatGPT Google is more likely to have taken that into account already because of its history in Europe and because of the size of the organization Savova said.

Today we friends and partners we are looking forwards  and thats why we are starting this state visit very consciously with a topic that is decisive for our future on this planet said Steinmeier. He said he was grateful that Charles had become involved in these issues early on. We also benefit from your conviction today your Majesty said Steinmeier. Charles will address the German lower house of parliament the Bundestag on Thursday in Berlin and meet some of the Ukrainians who have taken refuge in Germany from Russias invasion of their homeland. We are feeling just how deep our connection is especially in these times Steinmeier said in his speech at the banquet. Germany and the United Kingdom are today also militarily the two biggest supporters of Ukraine in Europe. The German president gifted Charles a photo of his first visit to Germany as a young child in 1962 with his father the late Prince Philip to visit relatives. Charles has visited Germany on more than 40 occasions as prince including 28 previous official visits. The British government makes the ultimate decision on such state visits which form part of its use of the monarchys soft power. As such the trip was a clear sign of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks push to reset relations with Europe said Anand Menon director of academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe. However any warmer relations with Europe brought about by the visit could cool if other postBrexit issues flare up. Britain has slumped from Germanys fifth most important trading partner to 11th in 2022 behind the Czech Republic.

The allied raids killed some 500000 people.

The agreement will allow some combustion engines beyond 2035 and was quickly condemned by a prominent environmental group. The bloc and its largest economy had been at odds over the planned 2035 phaseout of CO2emitting cars but leaders signalled in recent days that they were close to a resolution. Germany had wanted assurances that new combustion engine cars can be sold beyond the deadline if they run on efuels  a request supported by parts of Germanys powerful car industry. We have found an agreement with Germany on the future use of efuels in cars Frans Timmermans head of EU climate policy said on Twitter. German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said the way is clear with the agreement reached late Friday. Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO2neutral fuels he said in a post on Twitter. Sweden which holds the EUs rotating presidency said EU diplomats would vote on Monday to formally approve the 2035 phaseout law. That would mean energy ministers could then give the law the final signoff needed for it to enter into force on Tuesday at a scheduled meeting in Brussels. Benjamin Stephan of the Greenpeace campaign group said the deal was a setback for climate protection. This stinky compromise undermines climate protection in transport and it harms Europe he said. It dilutes the needed focus of the auto industry on efficient electromobility he said.

The Germans crashed out of the World Cup in Qatar in the group stage for the second consecutive time and are desperate to rebuild a team that can excite their home fans at next years European Championship. We have the Euro right in front of us but it is important to take it one step at a time Goetze told a news conference ahead of Saturdays friendly against Peru in Mainz. Germany also play Belgium on March 28 in their first two international matches of the year. What is important is to approach all of it the issues and our football step by step. Germany coach Hansi Flick has called up several newcomers for the two matches but has also retained the experienced 30yearold who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final. Goetze made his international comeback last year after a fiveyear absence. Germanys support at home has waned in recent years with the fourtime world champions struggling to fill stadiums having been eliminated early in their last three tournaments. Their disappointing groupstage exit in Qatar has added more pressure on the team. You learn from challenges and from not so good times. Its not always just going to get better in football. So you learn and you grow Goetze said. The midfielder is no stranger to career ups and downs. After lifting the World Cup he struggled to hold down a starting spot at Bayern Munich following his surprise departure from Borussia Dortmund in 2013. A return to Dortmund in 2016 proved less than successful before he revived his career with a twoseason spell at PSV Eindhoven in 2020 before joining Eintracht Frankfurt last year. I am relaxed about Qatar. Thats the good thing with football. You can quickly move on Goetze said. Our view is going only into the future and we try to take the best from all our experiences.

REUTERSFabrizio Bensch BERLIN March 20 Reuters  Talks between Germanys Transport Ministry and the European Commission about the planned end of new combustion engines from 2035 are moving forward the ministry said on Monday but added it could not say when an agreement would be reached. After months of negotiations the European Parliament the Commission and European Union member states agreed last year to the law that would require new cars sold in the EU from 2035 to have zero CO2 emissions  effectively making it impossible to sell combustion engine cars from that date. But Germany this month declared its lastminute opposition. It wants sales of new cars with internal combustion engines to be allowed after that date if they run on efuels. There are positive trends that are a good basis for further talks a spokesman for the ministry told a news conference. The ministry run by the liberal Free Democratic Party FDP proposed last week that the Commission should provide a separate vehicle category for cars that run only on efuels a letter from the ministry to the EU executive seen by Reuters showed. The Commission declined to comment on the letter which also suggested allowing carmakers to count such cars towards complying with CO2 targets. EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said in a news conference on Thursday that once a deal on a law is agreed between EU countries and the European Parliament it is important that both sides respect it. At the same time we have to make sure that the interpretation of that agreement people give is also something we can agree upon. And this is an ongoing conversation we are having with the German authorities right now Timmermans said. Such changes are legally problematic as the European Parliament has approved the regulations agreed between the blocs member states and the Commission meaning any change could be complicated and timeconsuming. An EU official said member states had been told at a meeting in November that the Commission would make a proposal on registering cars running on efuels after 2035 but only after the CO2 law for cars is finally adopted.

This does not come as a huge surprise given that Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun promised the same last year opens in new tab seemingly to address the limited availability of its flagship series Ultra models. The Xiaomi 12S Ultra in particular deserves to be on the roster of the top Android phones except that its not available outside of China. With the Xiaomi 13 Ultra getting a global launch both Xiaomi and Leica are touting several exciting upgrades for the handset. In a separate tweet opens in new tab the Germanybased camera maker teased the most perfect Summicron lens ever created in the field of mobile imaging. Summicron is of course Leicas branding for its camera lenses. While neither company went into specifics about the 13 Ultras imaging prowess a recent leak claimed that Xiaomis topend flagship phone would boast four 50MP sensors on the back. In contrast the Xiaomi 13 Pro only has a triple rear camera setup consisting of a 50MP main shooter a 50MP telephoto and a 50MP ultrawide camera. The Ultra model could go a step further by adding another 50MP zoom lens. Previous rumors also suggested that the Xiaomi 13 Ultra will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset which isnt surprising given that its siblings use the same processor.,What you need to know Xiaomi has confirmed the existence of an Ultra variant of its latest flagship phone series.

His form became inconsistent for the rest of his time in north London and the clubs fanbase became divided when he was awarded a new 350000aweek contract in 2018. His time with the national team was similarly fractious following up a starring role in Germanys victorious World Cup in Brazil with a poor performance at the 2018 tournament and becoming a scapegoat as the team went out in the group stage.

Pascal Canfin a French centrist MEP who chairs the European parliaments environment committee said an EU law that all cars sold from 2035 must produce zero emissions will be voted unchanged including by Germany on Tuesday. Diplomats meeting on Monday approved the compromise agreed between Berlin and Brussels over the weekend which will allow some combustion engines if they fill up with socalled climate neutral efuels. Although Italy and Poland oppose the law and Bulgaria is abstaining it is expected to be approved by a majority of EU countries on Tuesday. The row blew up after Germanys Free Democratic party a member of the threeway governing coalition withdrew support from an EU plan to ban the sale of new cars powered by internal combustion from 2035 without stronger guarantees for efuels. After going back on a deal agreed between EU ministers and the European parliament last October the German government secured further concessions over the future use of efuels which are not yet commercially available. Germanys transport minister Volker Wissing said Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO 2 neutral fuels. The European Commission vicepresident Frans Timmermans tweeted that after the agreement with Germany the commission would follow up swiftly with the necessary legal steps to implement what had been agreed and get the regulation adopted as swiftly as possible. The dispute was a sign of growing tensions about the EUs green deal a set of laws intended to ensure Europe achieves net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Berlins Uturn on a done deal also triggered concerns among some countries of copycat behaviour that would undermine EU decisionmaking. The probusiness FDPs lastminute revolt reflected concerns in the powerful German car industry among companies that have specialised in manufacturing parts unique to combustion engines such as exhaust pipes. Efuels which can be made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen or the chemical or thermal treatment of biofuels or biomass are thought likely to remain scarce for years to come. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planets most important stories.

Twelve fixtures separate Hansi Flicks side from the opening game in Munich in June 2024. All are friendlies which is less than ideal. No host nation has won a World Cup or European Championship on home soil since France in 1998 and perhaps the lack of competitive practice is one reason. The indeterminate 20 win over Peru last Saturday was one example friendlies may show you how bad you are but they wont necessarily show how good you are. Nine minutes into their game against Belgium in Cologne Germany were discovering exactly how bad. They were 20 down Yannick Carrasco and Romelu Lukaku with the goals. Kevin De Bruyne as well as collecting two assists was taking Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka for a joyride in central midfield. Virtually every Belgian attack seemed to generate a shot. Dodi Lukebakio missed a oneonone chance. Lukaku hit the bar with a header. Belgium could quite conceivably have been 40 or 50 up within 20 minutes. The first 35 minutes were the worst Ive seen in my long career grumbled the neverknowinglyunderstated Lothar Matthus on RTL afterwards and for all the comical pratfalling it already felt like an early point of crisis for Flick who had by no means been guaranteed to keep his job after the Qatar shambles. And again it was the habit of conceding unbelievably soft goals that had undone them an incontinent pressing system that somehow left them overcommitted up the pitch but without adequate pressure on the ball. This has to be a oneoff Flick warned. But it was what happened next that arguably made even less sense. Half an hour in Flick had seen enough. Florian Wirtz the teenage prodigy from Bayer Leverkusen was hooked along with the injured Goretzka. Emre Can came on in midfield and began to lock things down. On the stroke of halftime the totemic Bremen striker Niclas Fllkrug  a man who always looks as though hes going to hoist you off the ground for no reason  won and scored a penalty to pull a goal back. Gradually the crowd who had greeted the opening period more with bemusement than genuine anger began to swing behind them. Hansi Flick has a job to get Germany back to their best with only friendly matches between now and the start of Euro 2024. Photograph Markus GilliarGES SportfotoGetty Images This is the fragile connection Germany are also trying to build a challenge as important and intractable as any they face on the pitch. Reconnecting this team to its public  particularly a younger public with strong allegiances to their Bundesliga clubs but only a passing interest in the national side  is one of the Deutscher FussballBunds central missions before next summer. And yet in a country riven by public sector strikes forced in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the end of the Angela Merkel era to reconsider its identity and place in the world the prevailing note is scepticism rather than optimism. Woodstock cannot be repeated the veteran television commentator Bela Rethy said recently. In 2006 Germany was a different country more relaxed more tolerant. Not so dogmatic. Not so demagogic. Not so shoddy in defence either. On 78 minutes De Bruyne made it 31 with another simple counterattack. But even now Germany refused to lie down. The outstanding Serge Gnabry hit the post after an electrifying run that took him past four players. With three minutes remaining he converted from close range after another rapid raid down the left by Kevin Schade of Brentford setting up a rousing finale and about as heroic a 32 defeat as it is possible to conceive. And as they left the stadium everyone seemed satisfied enough. There was broad acknowledgement that this is a transitional team a team with many of its stars Thomas Mller Manuel Neuer Antonio Rdiger Ilkay Gndogan rested or injured. Flick bemoaned the lack of training time afforded him which he said contributed to the scruffiness of his teams attempted pressing. Twelve more experiments. Twelve more games to get this right against a backdrop of apathy a leaky defence an increasingly divided nation and a distinct lack of fullbacks. And yet if the Sommermrchen taught us anything it is that the German public do not demand victory as a nonnegotiable. They will forgive their team even the bitter pill of ultimate failure if it can make them dream. Flicks hardest task over the next 15 months is not to win but to give Germany a team they can believe in.,Bring on the new Sommermrchen read a banner that was unfurled at the RheinEnergie Stadion just before kickoff on Tuesday night.

Photograph Toby MelvilleREUTERS But Kevin Miles chief executive of the Football Supporters Association said the vast majority of England fans in 2006 had behaved well adding that recent decades had continued to see a significant change in the behaviour of travelling fans. Theres a totally different atmosphere and support than there was in the dark days of the past he said. I have every reason to expect that England fans will travel to Germany in big numbers and have a very positive impact on the atmosphere of the tournament. As we did last time. The Observer understands that a meeting to discuss Euro 2024 between fan groups the Football Association police foreign office and others will take place in the next few months. An FA spokesperson said that all travel club members would as for all tournaments be policechecked and there were measures in place for fans to report antisocial or discriminatory behaviour. It is also expected that the most hardcore troublemakers on banning orders  about 1300 people  will be told to hand their passports into police before the tournament as they were before last years World Cup in Qatar. England fan Kirsty Payne who has travelled the world supporting the team for more than 20 years said that chants about Two World Wars and One World Cup made her heart sink but were increasingly rare. I think its dying out she said. It costs a lot of money to travel so they are usually proper England supporters who are there for the football. I think the atmosphere will be great and the Germans will put on a fantastic show. Sport can send a very big message of unity against evil  England fan Billy Grant. Photograph Antonio OlmosThe Observer Her husband Andy who has supported England at every World Cup bar one for the past 40 years said the tournament was a moment to show European solidarity.

The obvious explanation is they drank to escape the unbearable awfulness of being in the German Democratic Republic with its omnipresent Stasi clowncar Trabants travel restrictions gerontocratic rulers grim Baltic holidays and laughable elections. Not so argues East Germanborn historian Katja Hoyer. Most East Germans drank not to forget their worries but because they had so little to worry about. She writes for those who wanted a quiet life with the small comforts of home it was a stable place with few concerns or worries. By the late 1980s true the level of surveillance carried out by the Stasi was at an alltime high but often it did little with the information gathered. In this it was arguably less intrusive certainly less effective than todays dataplundering technogiants. Not that Hoyer is an ostalgiefilled apologist. The GDR she describes is one divided between those who resented the permanent state of alert and politicisation of life and others who craved meaning and belonging in contrast to what they perceived to be the empty consumerism of the West. Indeed one way of reading Hoyers revisionist history is as a takedown of western hubris using the example of East Germany to highlight our shortcomings in social mobility and womens rights. Take childcare. In 1989 the GDR had one of the highest rates of female employment in the world mostly because state nurseries open from 6am to 6pm admitted children from birth. But after the Berlin Wall fell such expensively egalitarian services were dismantled and East German mothers found it difficult to square parenting with a career. As Hoyer puts it they were baffled when they had to justify why they even wanted both. As for social mobility the GDR gave ordinary citizens chances that homologues raised in say Britains sclerotic public school plutocracy can hardly aspire to. Tens of thousands of young people from workingclass backgrounds had been encouraged to study promoted to leadership positions and given scholarships Hoyer writes. In 1953 when there was an uprising against the fouryearold GDR many saw it as a threat to their new status. One consequence was the rise in voluntary security organisations such as the Freiwilliger Helfer der Volkspolizei Voluntary Auxiliary of the Peoples Police. An estimated 5000 volunteers even helped defend the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 believing no doubt that their homeland with all its opportunities needed protecting and prepared to spend their free time doing so. When Germany was divided into British French American and Russian sectors after the fall of the Third Reich few expected the last one would become an independent nation still less a walledin Stasiland. What is this GDR? asked Stalins security henchman Lavrentiy Beria in 1952. Its not even a proper state. It only exists because of Soviet troops. True Hoyer argues Moscow saw East Germany as geopolitical pawn to be sacrificed if necessary in order to win the burgeoning cold war. Indeed Stalin sought a reunified and neutral Germany as buffer between the socialist east and capitalist west. A year later though Stalin was dead and Beria was executed with a bullet to the head while East Germany would survive for another 37 years. On October 7 1989 a fouryearold Hoyer and her father celebrated the GDRs 40th anniversary with a trip to the viewing platform of Berlins Fernsehturm the socialistbuilt TV tower. Below police cars converged on Alexanderplatz in an attempt to quell the unstoppable protests that led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall a month later. Like most East Germans her dad had no inclination to join the demonstrators the Hoyers were comfortable with their secondhand Trabant and twobed flat in a 1960s prefab block. Today their daughter lives in the UK but not without a memory of what died that day. What makes her meticulous book essential reading is not so much its sense of what East Germans lost as what we never had. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The king had been scheduled to arrive in France on Sunday on his first state visit as monarch. He was due to visit Paris and Bordeaux before heading to Germany on Wednesday. Asked if the cancellation was humiliating for France the French president replied What would have been detestable for the British people as well as for ourselves would have been to maintain it with possible incidents in the process. In a statement earlier in the day the lyse Palace said the decision to postpone the visit had been taken by the French and British governments following a telephone conversation between Macron and Charles on Friday morning after mass protests against the French government the previous day. In a statement Buckingham Palace said The king and the queen consorts state visit to France has been postponed. Their majesties greatly look forward to the opportunity to visit France as soon as dates can be found. People angry at the French president were continuing protests on Friday after mass demonstrations on Thursday and had planned a further day of action next Tuesday during the royal visit. The lyse statement said it hoped to welcome the king in conditions that correspond our friendly relations and that the visit would be rescheduled as soon as possible. From the moment last night when the unions announced a new day of mobilisation on Tuesday and the kings visit was scheduled for Monday to Wednesday I think it would not be serious and would lack a certain common sense to propose to his majesty the king and queen consort to come on a state visit in the midst of demonstrations Macron said. As we have much friendship respect and esteem for his majesty the king and queen consort and the British people I took the initiative and called him to tell him the situation and the announcement of a new day of action and good sense and friendship led us to propose a postponement. He added When calm returns perhaps at the beginning depending on our diaries we can schedule a new state visit and we can welcome the new king and queen consort in conditions that will allow them to enjoy Paris as well as Bordeaux. More than 450 protesters were arrested on Thursday as about 300 demonstrations drew more than a million people nationwide to protest against unpopular pension changes that would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Unions said more than 3 million people took to the streets to demonstrate against a fiercely contested law that was pushed through parliament without a vote last week. 0118 Bordeaux city hall set on fire amid protests over France pension changes  video The president and his wife Brigitte had been due to host a banquet for Charles and Camilla the Queen Consort at the former royal palace at Versailles which critics viewed as having echoes of Marie Antoinette feasting while Paris revolted. Fabien Villedieu of the SudRail union had called on protesters to demonstrate at Versailles. We have two kings today one in England and one in France. Lets all go to Versailles and give them a proper welcome Villedieu told BFM TV. Olivier Besancenot of the New Anticapitalist party had said Well welcome Charles III with a good old general strike. On Thursday JeanLuc Mlenchon of the radical left La France Insoumise LFI told French television that the king was welcome in France but it is not the right time. After learning that the visit had been postponed Mlenchon tweeted The meeting of kings at Versailles broken up by popular demand. Raquel Garrido an LFI MP added Two kings were due to meet at Versailles. One down. One to go. After their arrival at Orly airport for the threeday visit on Sunday and a welcome by the French prime minister lisabeth Borne the programme included a ceremony under the Arc de Triomphe and a visit to the Muse dOrsay. Charles was due to give a speech at the Snat the upper house of the French parliament. The royal couple was then due to travel by train to Bordeaux on Tuesday to witness the devastation caused by last summers wildfires before marking the opening of the British consulate in the city and visiting an organic vineyard. Shortly before the announcement that the visit was to be postponed the interior minister Grald Darmanin was still insisting the visit would go ahead despite threats of disruption. We are obviously ready to welcome him the king in excellent conditions he said. However there were threats to disrupt the visit. French strikers had reportedly refused to literally roll out the red carpet while the powerful CGT union had said in a statement We will not be doing the furnishings the red carpets or other flags and decorations. Officials at Mobilier National the government agency responsible for the states furniture and fittings insisted enough people would be found to do so. About 4000 police and gendarmes were expected to be mobilised for the state visit which would have put additional pressure on law and order forces already stretched from policing weeks of protests.

Katja Hoyer is just old enough to remember its demise. In October 1989 when she was four years old her father took her on a trip to the top of Berlins Fernsehturm or Television Tower. Then and now the tallest building in Germany this masterpiece of socialist architecture was built between 1965 and 1969 as a demonstration of East Germanys technological prowess. But on that day in October when Hoyer looked down she saw squads of the Peoples Police arresting protesters on the massive cement square below. Neither policemen nor the protesters could have known that in a mere month the Berlin Wall would fall. Nor would they have imagined that in a years time the German Democratic Republic or GDR would cease to exist. Thirty years after its passing Hoyer now a journalist and historian has returned to the land of her birth with this rich counterintuitive history of a country all too often dismissed as a freak or accident of the cold war. Hoyers East Germany is not though the walledin Russiancontrolled Stasiland whose citizens suffered from constant surveillance and intimidation at the hands of the Ministry for State Security. Rather in her telling it was a place where people shaped their own destinies and lived lives in full colour  a far cry from the grey monotonous blur conjured by the western imagination. Unemployment barely existed. Housing was universally available and relatively cheap Hoyers East Germany was also a state whose leaders although propped up by the Red Army and dependent on the Soviet Union for critical raw materials in particular oil sought to navigate an independent path at home and on the international stage. Her account is largely a political history although one interspersed with interviews with ordinary East Germans teachers accountants factory workers and more tellingly the police officers and border guards who made the state work. Originally under Soviet army occupation following the end of the second world war East Germany became an independent country on 7 October 1949. But the story Hoyer tells in Beyond the Wall starts much earlier with the German Communist partys struggle to survive between Hitler and Stalin. In the runup to the second world war party members faced arrest and torture in Nazi Germany. This drove much of its leadership into exile in the Soviet Union where most eventually perished either in the gulags or by firing squad as victims of Stalins purges. The remnant of the party that survived to take over East Germany after the war was battlehardened and utterly loyal to its Soviet masters. Brought to Germany by the invading Red Army the partys leaders  most notably Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Pieck  began establishing a communistled dictatorship in the Soviet occupied zone. In a few years they succeeded in rapidly transforming the social economic and political organisation of the east by redistributing land nationalising industry and quashing any organised political opposition. In the process they triggered a mass exodus across the still open border to the west. Socialism triumphs a 1958 East German propaganda poster. Illustration ShawshotsAlamy Following Stalins death in 1953 the Communist party restyled as the more inclusivesounding Socialist Unity party or SED ruled East Germany with a mixture of repression and accommodation. On one hand the role of state security  the dreaded Stasi  expanded enormously. On the other the party leadership did what it could to ensure that all East Germans were at least gainfully employed and had their basic needs met. But it was not enough as long as an escape route remained open in the divided city of Berlin East Germany continued to haemorrhage skilled workers to the west. By 1961 almost 300000 people were leaving the GDR every year. That year the GDRs party head and unquestioned leader Ulbricht decided to put a stop to this flight once and for all by building the Berlin Wall  something he achieved at least in its initial woodandbarbed wire phase practically overnight and against the objections of his Soviet minders. Trapped behind barbed wire but increasingly prosperous East Germany began to resemble the gilded cage of the eastern bloc at least in the eyes of its socialist neighbours. However as Hoyer points out at least the gilding was real East Germany really did enjoy the highest standard of living of any socialist state. Unemployment barely existed. Housing was universally available and relatively cheap. Abundant accessible childcare allowed women to enter the workforce at a higher rate than in any other country in the world. As Erika Krger one of the workers Hoyer interviewed recalled life in the 1970s and 80s was quite happy We worked received our regular wages as well as bonuses for hard work. We got by and had nothing to worry about. It was only when Krger visited her sisterinlaw in West Germany that she realised the gap in living standards between east and west. But if East Germany lagged behind in the production of consumer goods and especially luxuries one of the many surprises of Beyond the Wall is the revelation of the extreme lengths the East German leadership was willing to go to keep its populace supplied with the imported goods and foodstuffs it considered essential to their emotional wellbeing. People were provided with stability relative prosperity and social mobility. It was a workers state that catered to workers interests. All of which prompts the question  why did it also build the largest per capita security system the world has ever known? Hoyer places most of the blame on paranoia especially on the part of the Stasis shadowy boss Erich Mielke. But one man does not a system make. It is here where one occasionally wishes that Hoyer broadened her vision from East Germany to the eastern bloc as a whole. A comparative viewpoint might have made clearer the peculiarity of East Germanys achievement and its tragedy. Both were rooted in the same geographic fact. As part of a larger prewar Germany East Germany was faced with the constant counterexample of the neighbouring Federal Republic. Its proximity just over the Wall encouraged its leadership to make their version of socialism as effective as humanly possible. It also pushed them to create one of the most extensive systems of control the world has ever seen.

Wie gehts? Sehr gut und dir? At which point Georgia Stanway and I have pretty much exhausted our meagre supply of German. Its not entirely our fault as any Brit living in Germany will tell you it is virtually impossible to learn the local language when everyone is intent on chattering away at you in English. Since moving to Bayern Munich last summer Stanway has been taking weekly lessons but admits shes still waiting for that click. The coach Alexander Straus conducts his team meetings in English. The training ground instructions are in English. The WhatsApp group is in English. Mercifully so is the rest of this interview. Still for a Barrow girl there are times when Munich feels a long way from home. Beans on toast is one example you can buy baked beans in Germany but somehow they dont taste the same to her. The 24yearold misses her family and friends even though they do their best to visit. Bayern may be giants of the mens game but in womens football they have won comparatively little. In leaving Manchester City then Stanway was stepping well out of her comfort zone into the challenge of a new country the test of a new league the burden that comes with being a marquee foreign signing the responsibility of dictating big games. Games such as the Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal on Tuesday. Ominously for Arsenal Stanways adaptation on the pitch has been a good deal smoother than her adaptation off it. Already this season she has scored seven goals from central midfield forging a formidable partnership with Sarah Zadrazil playing a starring role in a 31 deconstruction of Barcelona. Ive settled quicker than Ive expected she says. Ive improved a lot quicker than I expected as well. If there was a flashbulb moment in all this then it came in late October. After a slow start in the Bundesliga and a defeat by title rivals Wolfsburg Bayern travelled to Benfica in the Champions League. Stanway still hadnt scored a goal for her new club. On a warm night in Lisbon they went 20 down after an hour. Stanway remembers Were all looking at each other thinking here we go again. Maxi Rall pulled a goal back. But with seven minutes remaining Bayern were still behind. At which point Stanway got the ball in the Benfica half and started running into space. Sound familiar? This is perhaps the signature Stanway move the point at which she sees the gap breaks the chains and just goes. Three months earlier against Spain at Euro 2022 she saw a similar gap and won the game in extra time. Here 20 yards out she let fly with her left foot and buried a low shot into the corner. Then in the eighth minute of injury time she scored an almost identical goal with her right foot. Neither Bayern nor Stanway have looked back since. Georgia Stanway surges forward during Bayern Munichs Champions League group game against Benfica in October. Photograph Gualter FatiaGetty Images What goes through her mind in these moments? Is it a hero complex a kind of extreme clarity? I think its just intuition she says. You suddenly make a decision and back yourself. Im a person that doesnt have any regrets on the field. If I have a shot I have a shot. Im not too bothered. Jill Scott instilled that in me at City. Everything you do you do with full intent. I want to prove myself. I want to showcase every single aspect of me as a person and a player. And in those moments I can be special. We talk a little more about what she and Bayern are trying to build together not so much a praxis as a mentality. Wolfsburg are currently the dominant team in Germany with five of the last six titles. They have reached five Champions League finals to Bayerns none. So what comes first the winning mentality or the winning? How do Bayern take that final step? Theres a very fine line between us and Wolfsburg Stanway argues. They seem to edge it. Not really sure why. If youre constantly getting beat by the same team theres always that block. But its one of them where if we can beat Wolfsburg the tables will turn. The mentality can flip. At times we need to be nastier. Thats something I say to the girls a lot. Sometimes were a little bit too nice to each other a bit too nice with the opposition. This may be an opportune moment to point out that Stanway already has seven yellow cards this season. For now it is Arsenal in their crosshairs and a reunion with old friends Leah Williamson Lotte WubbenMoy and the injured Beth Mead with whom she shared the ride of a lifetime with England last summer. Since the draw was made last month there have been friendly greetings shared dinner plans made. Hopefully they can stay after the game and I can show them a little bit of the city Stanway says. What is Williamson like to play against? Nasty Stanway replies immediately. You dont want to be on her bad side. But I love her to bits and shes one of my closest friends. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter Informative passionate entertaining.

Photograph Alessandra TarantinoAP And so we come to the European Championship the white elephant in the room the thing that everyone remembers but is also desperate not to dwell on. There have been books documentaries retrospectives. The whole thing has been memorialised so efficiently that the actual memories are hard to discern. Does she ever get tired of being asked about it? No she says. You dont get tired of it. But its difficult. You dont really have time to reflect because youre on to the next thing. If there was anything I would tell myself in that moment its to try and be more present. Make the most of those days. Over the years Ive talked to athletes who achieved great things and then felt almost nothing afterwards who reached the pinnacle and didnt know how to feel about it. Did this happen to her? Stanway thinks for a moment. Because the biggest high of your life you almost experience a comedown she says. You experience different things at different times. I was fortunate not to experience it straight away because I was moving to Bayern it was something new it was exciting. So I probably experienced mine a little bit later maybe over the Christmas period. Youve just got to dig a little bit deeper to find that motivation. But no longer. There is a World Cup coming this summer reputations to make and defend a chance to make new history with a new team. The games against Arsenal will show us just how far Bayern have come the duels with Kim Little and Lia Wlti will give Stanway an idea of her own progress. These are the sorts of challenges Stanway signed up for the tests she has always craved. Its a difficult one she says finally. But its also the most exciting.,Guten Tag. Wie gehts? Sehr gut und dir?

Hodgson is of course Southgates de facto predecessor in the job setting aside the onegame Sam Allardyce interlude which feels more than ever like the managerial equivalent of a halfremembered lost weekend on a Norwegian booze ferry. As England prepare for the doubleheader against Italy in Naples and Ukraine at Wembley first steps on the gentle downhill slope towards Germany 2024 it is worth remembering just how lost they were back then. Which was to be clear very lost indeed. Hodgsons own time did at least provide some variation veering between the slowburn humiliation of Kyiv 2012 the more vivid and sustained humiliation of Brazil 2014 through to the generational humiliation of Nice two years later Hodgson emerging for his final bow looking like a casino floor rou still dressed in last nights tuxedo the weight of a halfimagined sporting empire on his sagging shoulders. It is worth remembering all this if only because the journey from there to here has been a little undervalued. If Southgate makes it to Germany he will become the first proper England manager to take the team to four proper tournaments. Walter Winterbottom lasted four World Cups but he was more a kind of house master figure cooking dinner and doing the washing up taking the players to the opera. SvenGran Eriksson got three tournaments Bobby Robson three and Alf Ramsey three in less congested times the internet will tell you Ramsey also reached the quarterfinals of Euro 72 but in fact this was a losing twolegged playoff to get to the tournament proper. In the shadow of this Southgate so awkward in his early public appearances he was described by one wag as resembling an anteater that is only now realising its not supposed to be able to talk has become the curator of England footballs most sustained period of success in the last half century. It is worth remembering this too as the endgame starts to take shape. In many ways the best England Southgate is still early England Southgate that beaky figure in the rented wedding suit who seemed for one sunlit summer to be proving that this isnt an impossible job after all. Gareth Southgates popularity peaked during Englands World Cup campaign in 2018. Photograph Clive RoseGetty Images Over time as simple competence has been met with a chorus of howling public dismay Southgate has established the opposite. This thing really is doomed to the extent we have now reached a peak moment in the Gareth Paradox the logic of which goes a bit like this. Southgates early success was based on shedding the burden of English exceptionalism. In doing so he also dramatically reinvigorated English exceptionalism. As such and thanks to his own early gains Southgate is now considered by some a national disgrace the poison not the cure for the crime of failing to win three straight tournaments playing allout attacking Albionball. Winning just a bit is not enough. Only all of the winning will do. There is no escape route from here. If England go on to win Euro 2024 playing classic Southgatestyle roundhead football he will be condemned for not winning it right. If England win playing thrilling fastforward football there will be uproar and toldyousos at the failure to do this previously. Not winning Euro 2024 the most likely outcome for every manager present will see Southgate waved off by many as an outright failure whereas in reality he is the precise opposite a qualified and commendable success. In part this is related to tribal politics. Southgate has supported his players in protesting against racism has expressed misgivings about the state of England. Hes still Nord a little gawky and wellspoken unblokey and academic in his approach. For these crimes some will never forgive him. Quick Guide Italy v England predicted lineups Show Italy 433 Donnarumma Di Lorenzo Toli Acerbi Spinazzola Barella Jorginho Verratti Berardi Retegui Pellegrini England 433 Pickford Walker Stones Maguire Shaw Phillips Rice Bellingham Saka Kane Foden Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Mainly the hostility is based in a loss of scale the refusal to accept that England can be just quite good that England winning is not the natural order of things anything else a baffling aberration. Or indeed that if Southgate were simply to maximise the attacking power to let slip the dogs of Gareth stop tying us in defensive red tape then the world would kneel before Albion as it longs to deep down. Southgate succeeded by knowing the limits of his team. This was never going to be enough. We demand our sunlit uplands of the halfimagined past. There will be more talk of how exactly England are going to play now if the style of this team can become a little more geared towards attack. And it is a point worth making firstly because England did exactly this at the World Cup and second because this group of players looks equipped to take it a little further. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

First because Southgate did all the things he is often accused of ducking. The team for a World Cup quarterfinal was a 433 with KaneSakaFodenBellingham and four attacking subs to follow. England had 16 shots to Frances eight and 57 possession. They got stronger as the game wore on and dominated midfield in the second half a reversal of the pattern of recent tournaments. Only the most committed antiSouthgate truther could find a timidity in the approach here. England lost because France have mature highgrade players in all positions and executed the fine details better such as for example not gumbooting a late penalty over the bar. But there is room to take this further now. Southgate should also have learned from the experience. And the squad has improved even in the last four months. Reece James is a major addition. Jack Grealish is playing well for Manchester City. Bukayo Saka gets better with every game. Jude Bellingham is on a constant upward curve. Ivan Toney looks like actual centreforward backup. Marcus Rashford will hopefully bring new unstoppable Marcus Rashford when he returns. The same weaknesses remain. Jordan Pickford is a good but not Agrade goalkeeper and the same can be said of the centrebacks. England lack a really good controlling player in midfield. But there is encouragement in Southgates best solution to this which does not involve playing five defenders. The great gift from the World Cup is the evidence that Bellinghams allround palette of skills means Southgate can play a threeman midfield while protecting defensive weaknesses and retaining attacking strengths. The presence of Kalvin Phillips in this squad has drawn enmity and the dread accusation of loyalty which is always a terrible thing. But Phillips is in because that role is vital to releasing these strengths and Southgate doesnt have many midfielders who can run and pass and cover. It seems clear Southgate would ideally have Phillips in that three. This isnt loyalty. Its an investment in a player who has the required skills to make that shape work and free up rest of the team. And so on to Germany which feels like a Southgate kind of tournament. His professional life still revolves around the moment at its centre the primly scuffed Euro 96 penalty Andreas Mllers wildly infuriating victory prance that profound sense of an endless England operetta of hope and misfortune. By the end of Germany 2024 should England get there only Ramsey and Winterbottom will have managed more games. Southgate himself will have spent 20 years of his life as an England player and coach defining the role more clearly than any other modern incarnation. History suggests there are no happy endings in this job. Not to mention very few happy beginnings or happy middle periods. But Qatar 2022 was paradoxical too arguably Southgates best tournament in terms of fluency and development despite the less showy end result. England have made a habit of losing a few of these limbweary midweek filler games. But there is still a chance here to end on a major chord.,There is a nice note of circularity about the reemergence of Roy Hodgson English footballs own courtly blazered grail knight in the same week that Gareth Southgate sets off on what will surely be his own final story cycle as England manager.

More than 100 years later a feature film about the violence perpetrated by Germany in what is now Namibia explores that brutal colonial past for the first time. Its director hopes Measures of Men will bring the calamitous episode to the attention of ordinary Germans. Germany has denied its colonial past for 120 years Lars Kraume said in advance of the films domestic release on Thursday. Most people are unaware Germany even had a colonial past let alone anything about the brutality of it  it is not even taught in schools. Measures of Men filmed mainly on location in Namibia using local crew and expertise tells the story of Alexander Hoffmann  played by Leonard Scheicher  a young idealistic but wideeyed ethnologist who questions the evolutionist racial theories of the time according to which sizes and shapes of skulls determined intelligence. His attempts to rebut the pseudoscientific legitimisation of the superiority of white people over people from the colony of southwest Africa leads him to take first an intellectual and then a romantic interest in Kezia Kambazemi the interpreter of a delegation of Nama and Herero people who are shipped to Berlin to participate in the Kaisers Vlkerschau or human zoo exposition. Despite studying history for his final exams in Germany Kraume became aware of Germanys colonial past only when he visited Namibia in the early 1990s immediately after its independence from South Africa. That experience sowed the seeds for his film he said. His aim was always to make an accurate historical retelling of the events but one which is also relevant and important to the present. Kraume was particularly shocked by the existence of thousands of skulls of people murdered by Germans which were gathered and shipped to Germany in large quantities and still exist in museums across the country. I cannot comprehend the fact that we have these skulls like artefacts stored in ethnological museums he said. I cannot understand why they are still being kept and have not been given back. You ask yourself Why were the skulls collected in the first place and why have we not seen fit to give them back? Kraume said it was shameful that Germany had yet to give an official apology for the genocide or for the theft of human remains and cultural artefacts. The films relevance to the present day Kraume said is also in its depiction of how those in power choose to ignore scientific facts and truth for political gain and in order to maintain the status quo. The same bogus theories of race espoused at the time later became subsumed into the Nazi regimes policies which were used to justify the Holocaust.

While most German cities commemorate the victims of the Nazi period there are no significant monuments to the victims of German colonialism. Girley Charlene Jazama who plays the part of Kambazemi is one of hundreds of Namibians involved in the project. A Herero herself she said participating in the film was more than just taking on a film role but was connected directly to her own family history. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

She worked as a tea lady for one of the German commandants Jazama said in an interview in Berlin. She was raped by an officer in the camp. My greatgrandmother was subsequently born in one of these concentration camps in 1909. Jazama appealed to the German authorities to facilitate the return of the skulls to Namibia as soon as possible. They quite simply do not belong to the Germans. I hope that over the course of time they will return to their rightful owners the Namibians so that they can be given a dignified burial. They are part of the trauma that has been passed from generation to generation she said adding that many Namibians are yet to be made aware of the facts of the colonisation. Kraume said one of the moral dilemmas he had experienced shooting the film was how to persuade Namibian actors to reconstruct scenes of violence based on reallife events. How do you tackle a scene in which soldiers hang two Herero men? How dramatic and how factual do you dare to make it? The film charts the moral degeneration of Hoffmann the ethnologist. Kraume insisted that because of Germanys perpetrator role not only in this period but later in the Nazi era there could be nothing redeeming about the character. Make a film of real heroes where you find them but you simply cannot invent a German hero. Hoffmanns cowardice Kraume said is a reflection of Europeans attitude towards Africa. Like Hoffmann they have run away  thats what we keep doing with Africa failing to admit to the terror we have brought to Africa turning away from their problems as if theyre nothing to do with us. Germany he points out while admitting to the genocide committed by its army and having returned the remains of Herero and Nama men and women in 2018 has yet to sign a reparation agreement with Namibia. In recent weeks the film has been viewed by audiences across Namibia in a solarpowered mobile cinema. The whole purpose of this film is that it will trigger debate that people will exchange opinions wherever it is shown Kraume said.,It was one of the darkest eras in German history and the first genocide of the 20th century the mass killing of tens of thousands of people in German South West Africa after a rebellion against colonial rule by the Herero and Nama tribes. More than 100 years later a feature film about the violence perpetrated by Germany in what is now Namibia explores that brutal colonial past for the first time. Its director hopes Measures of Men will bring the calamitous episode to the attention of ordinary Germans.

In January I received six penalty charge notices PCNs from Transport for London TfL each dated November 2022 through its agent Euro Parking Collection EPC. The fines for driving within Londons ultralow emission zone Ulez were 95.96 84.10 each if paid by the end of last November two months before they reached me. As Id missed the deadline they were 287.88 each. My car is a leased Volkswagen Passat GTE a petrolelectric hybrid and is Euro 6 compliant yet Im facing a 1727.28 bill. I tried repeatedly to challenge the fines but each time the TfL website returned an error message so I made an online representation to EPC but have been told by TfL the fines still stand. AL Braunschweig Germany The Ulez introduced in central London in 2019 and due to be expanded across Greater London in August requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily charge. However those from mainland Europe have been hit with fines amounting to thousands of euros despite driving compliant cars. Vehicles from overseas must be preregistered with TfL before entering the zone otherwise they may be deemed noncompliant. In 2022 167663 fines were sent overseas. Unluckily for you EPC which enforces them recently gained access to vehiclekeeper records in Germany the Netherlands and France and has been making up for lost time by firing off PCNs for alleged offences months previously. Amazingly there is no legal cutoff after which PCNs cannot be issued. By the time they reach drivers in your case via the leasing company which caused added delays they have rocketed for one couple to 3589 after a trip to London. TfL says the registration process for foreign vehicles is on its website but youd have to know of the requirement to look. It says overseas vehicles are deemed polluting by default if EPC is unable to confirm emission details from the relevant licensing authority. And it claims that if a driver can prove the vehicle is compliant it will cancel the PCN. Not in your case. You were informed there was no option to appeal since the fine was being enforced by EPC. Asked why payment deadlines are not extended for overseas drivers given postal delays TfL says it expects EPC to act reasonably. TfL cancelled the charges after I got in touch. It says It is clear the service the driver received was not good enough. EPC was contacted for a comment. Email your.problemsobserver.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

Ferencz a Harvardeducated lawyer secured convictions of numerous German officers who led roving death squads during the war. Circumstances of his death were not immediately disclosed. The New York Times reported that Ferencz died at an assisted living facility in Boynton Beach Florida. He was just 27 years old when he served as a prosecutor in 1947 at Nuremberg where Nazi defendants including Hermann Gring faced a series of trials for crimes against humanity including the genocide known as the Holocaust in which six million Jewish people and millions of others were systematically killed. Ferencz then advocated for decades for the creation of an international criminal court a goal realised with the establishment of an international tribunal that sits in The Hague the Netherlands. Ferencz also was a significant donor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum established in Washington. Today the world lost a leader in the quest for justice for victims of genocide and related crimes the US Holocaust Museum said in a post on Twitter. Today the world lost a leader in the quest for justice for victims of genocide and related crimes. We mourn the death of Ben Ferenczthe last Nuremberg war crimes prosecutor. At age 27 with no prior trial experience he secured guilty verdicts against 22 Nazis.  US Holocaust Museum HolocaustMuseum April 8 2023 At Nuremberg Ferencz became chief prosecutor for the US in the trial of 22 officers who led mobile paramilitary killing squads known as Einsatzgruppen that were part of the notorious Nazi SS. The squads carried out mass killings targeting Jewish people Gypsies and others  primarily civilians  during the war in Germanoccupied Europe and were responsible for more than a million deaths. It is with sorrow and with hope that we here disclose the deliberate slaughter of more than a million innocent and defenseless men women and children Ferencz said in his opening statement at the trial. This was the tragic fulfilment of a program of intolerance and arrogance. Vengeance is not our goal nor do we seek merely a just retribution. We ask this court to affirm by international penal action mans right to live in peace and dignity regardless of his race or creed. The case we present is a plea of humanity to law Ferencz added. Ferencz told the court that the accused officers methodically carried out longrange plans to exterminate ethnic national political and religious groups condemned in the Nazi mind. Genocide  the extermination of whole categories of human beings  was a foremost instrument of the Nazi doctrine Ferencz said. The defendants all were convicted and 13 were given death sentences. It was Ferenczs first career case. Born on 11 March 1920 in Transylvania Romania Ferencz was 10 months old when his family moved to the United States where he grew up poor in New York Citys Hells Kitchen. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1943 he joined the U.S. military and fought in Europe before joining the US armys newly formed war crimes section. He seized documents and record evidence at Nazi death camps such as Buchenwald after their liberation by allied forces surveying scenes of human misery including piles of emaciated corpses and the crematoriums where untold numbers of bodies were incinerated. After the war ended in 1945 Ferencz was recruited to join in the US prosecution at the war crimes trials in Nuremberg a city where the Nazi leadership had held elaborate propaganda rallies before the war serving under US General Telford Taylor. The trials were controversial at the time but ended up being hailed as a milestone on the path toward establishing international law and holding war criminals accountable in evenhanded trials. What was most significant about it was it gave us and it gave me an insight into the mentality of mass murderers Ferencz said in a 2018 interview with the American Bar Association. They had murdered over a million people including hundreds of thousands of children in cold blood and I wanted to understand how it is that educated people  many of them had PhDs or they were generals in the German Army  could not only tolerate but lead and commit such horrible crimes. After the Nuremberg trials Ferencz worked to secure compensation for Holocaust victims and survivors. Ferencz later advocated for the creation of an international criminal court. In 1998 120 countries adopted a statute in Rome to establish the international criminal court which came into force in 2002.,Benjamin Ferencz the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials in Germany that brought Nazi war criminals to justice after the second world war and a longtime apostle of international criminal law died on Friday at age 103 US media reported citing his son.

Weeks after the Match of the Day presenter was suspended for criticising government immigration policy the former England footballer has said he stands by his remarks in an interview with Mens Health UK magazine. The row began when the former England footballer responded to a video message by the home secretary Suella Braverman about stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats. He wrote Good heavens this is beyond awful. He later tweeted This is just an immeasurably cruel policy. Referring to the tweet in which he also likened the home secretarys language to that of 1930s Germany Lineker said I think that is factually accurate. The BBCs highestpaid presenter said he wasnt prepared to back down on language he felt was fair and true. In the video announcing an illegal migration bill that has since come under fire from the UN Refugee Agency Braverman said the new legislation would help to detain and remove asylum seekers arriving in small boats. Lineker told the magazine I talked about the use of words like invasion and swarms and criminals and rapists which I think we should be very careful about because it has reallife consequences. He added that he has worked with refugee charities for years. I wasnt abusive I wasnt saying she Braverman was a Nazi he said. After the impartiality row the BBC announced an independent review of its social media guidelines a decision later echoed by the regulator Ofcom which said the corporations editorial guidelines needed updating for the modern world. The BBCs chair Richard Sharp also came under increasing pressure to quit after the corporation apologised for its actions. Lineker who receives 1.35m annually returned to presenting sport on the BBC after widespread disruption to sports programming when presenters Ian Wright Alan Shearer and Alex Scott among others pulled out of their respective shows in solidarity. The BBC has attempted to frame the row over Lineker as a question of preserving impartiality. However the corporation did not take any action when Lineker questioned Qatars human rights record during the recent mens football World Cup. Linekers agent Jon Holmes who has worked with the former footballer since 1980 previously said his client believed he had a special agreement with the BBCs director general to tweet publicly on matters surrounding refugees and immigration. Lineker told Mens Health UK that when new social media guidelines were introduced by the director general Tim Davie in 2020 he agreed he would not stop occasionally tweeting about the climate crisis and refugees. He said a key resolution with senior management at the BBC had come as other presenters expressed solidarity after he was taken off the air for his remarks. I love the BBC and I was very glad to be back on air and talking about football again Lineker said.

Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 in order to make up the numbers of a Ukrainian battalion with Portugal contributing three tanks and Sweden 10. Poland has supplied Ukraine with a battalion of the older Leopard 2 A4 model. As promised our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends Boris Pistorius the German defence minister said on Monday night. I am sure that they can make the difference on the front. The vehicles were handed over at the Ukrainian border at the end of last week the news magazine Der Spiegel reported adding that 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and two tank recovery vehicles promised by Berlin have also arrived in Ukraine. For security reasons the German government would not comment on the route by which the tanks were delivered. Kyiv which had a limited numbers of tanks from the Soviet or postSoviet era has said it urgently needs heavier armour for its defence against Russias invasion with the Germanmade Kampfpanzer Leopard 2 at the top of its list. Armed with a 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns the 1970sdesigned machine is the most popular tank in Natos inventory because of its speed of up to 42 miles an hour fuel efficiency and ability to shoot with high levels of accuracy even while manoeuvring over rough terrain. Operated by a crew of four  a commander gunner loader and driver  about 2000 Leopard 2s are in use by European countries. Over the last two months Ukrainian soldiers have been trained in using the complex weapons system of the tanks A6 variant at a Bundeswehr site in Munster Lower Saxony. The Ukrainian soldiers did not only prove themselves to be incredibly motivated but also able to handle the technology and deployment principles a Bundeswehr commander Bjrn Schulz told Der Spiegel. Confirmation that the German tanks had been delivered came as the Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Iryna Zolotar said Britishmade Challenger 2 tanks were in Ukraine already. The defence minister Oleksii Reznikov posted a picture of a Challenger 2 alongside other westernmade military vehicles on his Facebook page describing the British vehicle as a work of military art.

Ultimately we have to watch them and determine who are the best ones to come in based on form and potential. Its hard when you are seeing someone playing in the Premier League and someone playing in League One  youve still got to trust yourself and trust that you know the players capabilities. There is another factor in Englands favour for the World Cup the experience of winning last summers Under19s European Championship. It has definitely helped us says IlingJunior .

Trigger Cut a threepiece from Stuttgart were due to play seven venues in the UK this week but say they were turned away by the UK Border Force at Calais on Thursday 6 April. Tim Burgess the frontman of The Charlatans said the German bands nightmare experience showed the damage Brexit was doing to touring musicians What happened to Trigger Cut is scary as bands from the EU are facing confusing and complex rules that mean UK tour dates might just not be worth their while. Ian Smith a longtime music agent who cofounded Carry On Touring and ukeartswork.info which campaigns to help artists work in the EU and UK said each month he heard of artists from the EU being refused entry because of postBrexit requirements. They are so bloody opaque and confusing he said. Trigger Cut say their passports were confiscated and they were kept in a room for verification at Calais before a Border Force officer asked them for a certificate of sponsorship COS from each venue they were due to play. Ralph Schaarschmidt Trigger Cuts guitarist wrote on Facebook Months of planning 1750km of driving to Calais and back to Stuttgart van hire costs paid for expensive customs declarations ferry ticket  all for nothing. We are sitting in a deep dark hole emotionally right now this is a nightmare  I think Ive never felt so degraded sad and bad as I do today. Smith who has been in touch with the band said they did not have the COS certificates. Instead they planned to enter the UK under the permitted paid engagement PPE exemption which is free. This allows musicians to spend up to one month touring the UK if they are invited and paid by a UKbased organisation or client. Artists must be able to show a formal invitation to attend a prearranged event and prove they can support themselves during the trip and can pay for their return journey. A COS is an alternative route into the UK regarded as a safer bet but with more onerous paperwork said Smith. It involves a promoter sponsoring the band and checking their eligibility and vouching for them during their stay in the UK from a few days to up to 90 days. Smith said many artists were getting stuck at the border because the government guidance was unclear and printed only in English rather than any EU languages. The other problem he said was that individual border officers can use their discretion to refuse anyone they like at the border and there is no right of appeal. Schaarschmidt said he would not try to tour the UK again Despite all the love for music these bureaucratic costintensive humiliating conditions are not at all tolerable. Burgess said the damage of Brexit to musicians was unfolding slowly and there are already major difficulties for touring bands with spiralling costs and dwindling potential income affected by streaming. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

The government rattle on enough that music is one of the UKs strongest exports but they are hollowing out the chances for new artists in the future he said. Smith said the government should educate UK promoters and venues in the entry requirements for overseas artists to stop other artists suffering the same fate as Trigger Cut.

Since antiCovid measures ended across Europe last year tourism has started to recover but there are growing signs that significant numbers of French and Germans  two of the largest markets for UK tourism  are staying away. Since October 2021 EU citizens have needed a passport to enter the UK. Previously they could use ID cards but less than half the population of France and Germany hold a valid passport. People who run tourist attractions and businesses in the UK say that although Americans have returned in large numbers the French and Germans have not. Jerseys government is so concerned that last month it announced a pilot project allowing French citizens to show their ID cards on day trips to the island. This year walking tours in Oxfordshire a significant part of the tourist trail for foreign visitors are seeing bookings from France and Germany at half their 2019 levels. The number of passenger vehicles transported by Le Shuttle through the Channel tunnel in the first two months of 2023 dropped to 251175 compared with 314497 in 2019. Brittany Ferries said in December that it had 155000 arrivals in 2022 compared with 338000 in 2019. The decline is not just down to the issue of passports  Brexit has also battered the perception of Britain as a welcoming nation for tourists. Data from Visit Britain and the Anholt Ipsos Nation Brand Index shows a decline in how French and German people view the UKs standing compared with other countries. In 2016 Germans ranked the UK as the 7th best place to visit and French people ranked it 9th. By 2022 the UK had fallen to 16th and 14th respectively. Joss Croft OBE chief executive of UKinbound the trade association for the inbound tourism industry said French and German tourists still regard the UK very highly. However we know that the introduction of the new requirement for passports for EU citizens to access the UK  is proving to be a deterrent to travel particularly for school groups due to the additional costs and bureaucracy he said. School groups are particularly badly affected because if one or two children in a class of 30 do not have passports teachers will elect to travel to Ireland or Malta for English language trips instead. Children with nonEU passports such as refugees will also need a 95 visa to enter the UK. Research by the Tourism Alliance last year found there had been an 83 drop in schoolchildren and students visiting the UK leading to a loss of 875m and 14500 jobs. About 28 million people in Germany have passports according to a 2007 parliamentary answer out of a population of 83 million. In France about 32 million passports have been issued in the last 10 years out of a population of 67 million. Hayley BeerGamage chief executive of Experience Oxfordshire said that bookings from French and German groups were at 50 of prepandemic levels. That clearly shows that actually the market isnt returning and the desire  to visit Oxfordshire England the UK is not there as it was before the pandemic she said. Weve got to make sure that the nation is not losing those markets the other side of the pandemic. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Broadly speaking many Europeans have a less favourable view of some aspects of the UK he said. They are a really important market. The Germans particularly visit parts of Britain that others do not like Devon and Cornwall. But theyre not going to disappear. Last month when Rishi Sunak met Emmanuel Macron following the announcement of the Windsor framework the leaders announced that France and the UK would expand opportunities for school trips. Emma English executive director of the British Educational Travel Association Beta said that ID cards remained an issue but her members were enthused by the declaration. There is however no information on this she added. Beta has written to Robert Jenrick the immigration minister asking for details. Businesses are also concerned about plans to introduce electronic travel authorisation ETA rolling out from October. The scheme similar to the USs Esta system will mean that even tourists who do not require a visa will need to pay for a digital permit. Richard Toomer executive director of the Tourism Alliance said ETAs need to be priced at a reasonable level. We really need to look again at our high visa costs he said.

The centreforwards script writers had been busy that season the one in which he broke through so suddenly at Tottenham and they were never going to disappoint. On as a 71stminute substitute for Wayne Rooney Kane took only 79 seconds to score a farpost header from Raheem Sterlings cross. The TV cameras cut to Rooney on the bench smiling broadly and applauding. Afterwards he would sign Kanes shirt along with the rest of the team. Well done mate 1st of many he wrote. Rooney knew that there would be many many more. Harry Kane scores his first England goal a header against Lithuania in March 2015. Photograph Christopher LeeThe FAGetty Images Spool forward to Kanes fourth cap the qualifier against Switzerland in September of that year when he scored his third England goal. He was on the pitch when Rooney made it 20 from the penalty spot to reach 50 for the nation and break Sir Bobby Charltons record. In fact Kane was the first player over to celebrate with Rooney whispering something in his ear before embracing him. What did he say? Congratulations surely. Or perhaps Im coming for you. It is fun to imagine. Kanes chase to overhaul Rooneys eventual tally of 53 has been marked by everything that defines him dedication determination composure under pressure selfbelief. There have been memorable high points  along with the lows  and the overall sense of a hunter reeling in its prey inexorably inevitably. For some time it has come to be a question of where and when. Now we have the answer Kane getting there with a penalty of almost implausibly rich narrative strands in Thursday nights Euro 2024 qualifying win over Italy in Naples. The 29yearold faces a struggle to process the magnitude of what he has achieved  Harry Kane Englands alltime leading scorer shudder  but the first thing to say is that it truly is the fulfilment of a dream. With all the love and respect for Spurs Kane has always considered England as his No 1 priority and he has never hidden that. He loves to look back on the photos of himself and his elder brother Charlie in their England shirts as kids or remember how they would go with their parents Pat and Kim to the Sirloin pub in Chingford east London to watch the major tournament ties. Kane saw almost all of Englands games at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup in the Sirloins huge beer garden and he would imagine when he was older that he could become one of the players on the big screen maybe the captain like his idol David Beckham. Weve always been England fans Kanes mum Kim has said. Whenever England were playing when the boys were younger we would always dress up do face painting and go to the local pub to watch games. It was always special to celebrate England games with friends and family. There were also many tears too! Kane has had the old place jumping with his tournament goals which have accounted for a healthy proportion of his record return  12 to be precise beginning with the six that swept him to the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup taking in the four at Euro 2020 all of which came in the knockout rounds and then the two at the 2022 World Cup also during the knockout phase. It is interesting to note that 33 of Kanes goals have been in qualification ties and only six in friendlies with the other three in the Nations League. Or that 49 have come with him as the captain. When Gareth Southgate first gave him the armband in a friendly against Scotland in June 2017 he responded by volleying a 93rdminute equaliser. How he has thrived on the responsibility.

When Harry Maguire flicked on a Kieran Trippier corner Southgate was seen to shout Wheres Harry? Up popped Kane generating the power on the ball with a whip of his neck muscles. Oh theres Harry. It was surely bettered by the goal against Germany in the last 16 of the Euros the clinching second in the 20 win  a seismic triumph given the background.

Here was a dose of redemption Kane a prominent redeemer. Kanes story has been heavy on proving people wrong on overcoming setbacks  his infamous release by Arsenal as an eightyearold the difficult loans at Norwich and especially Leicester the oneseason wonder jibes in 201415. Even before his showstopper against Germany he had been widely questioned after three groupstage blanks. Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2020. Photograph Kevin QuigleyEuro 2020 newspapers pool It has been a triumph of mentality as well as ability of hard work and remorseless focus. Watch him in a prematch warmup picking out the top corner in shooting drills again and again. Listen to what his teammates say about him in training how he picks out the top corner again and again. How he stays behind to keep on doing it. Kanes qualities seem to be distilled when he stands over a penalty. Eighteen of his England goals have come from the spot he has missed four although when he did so against Denmark in the Euro semifinal he scored on the rebound. There was no such reprieve when he lifted high against France in the World Cup quarterfinal last December  the lowest moment of his career. The next most successful England penalty converter has been Frank Lampard with nine. Rooney got seven from the spot Charlton three. And given what Kane went through against France there was an inevitability about his recordbreaking goal being a penalty. There are those who are a little bit sniffy about the number of penalties that Kane has scored as if they carry a lower value rather than representing the acid test of nerve. But did they complain for example when Kane scored from the spot against Colombia in the last 16 at the 2018 World Cup to put England 10 up? Kane fluffed his lines against France a miss  as he has suggested  that will haunt him forever. Only a tournament win with England you suspect would put that right.

Hamburg is a trading hub known for its anglophilia with close connections to Great Britain that go back centuries that were revived during the British occupation of the city after the second world war when the former enemy quickly turned into a close partner. When you take the long view at UKGerman relations this part of the kings trip is at least as important and meaningful as his appointments in the German capital. Those who criticise royal visits as constituting little more than expensive photoops fail to understand that not all symbolism is empty. On Friday the king will visit St Nikolai church in the centre of Hamburg and lay a wreath there with the German president FrankWalter Steinmeier. The symbolic importance of this ceremony can hardly be overstated. The church is a landmark of the city dating back to the middle ages. After a fire in 1842 it was rebuilt by the English architect Sir George Gilbert Scott who also built the Albert Memorial and the Foreign Office in London. In the otherwise very close historic relationship between Hamburg and Great Britain St Nikolai is a reminder of their darkest moment. During the devastating bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 by allied forces the church was damaged beyond repair. This attack codenamed Operation Gomorrah in reference to the biblical story of Genesis when God decided to punish the sinners of Gomorrah by making it rain fire from the sky is to this day etched into Hamburgs collective memory under a different name the fire storm. Between 25 July and 3 August 1943 the Royal Air Force flew a series of four night raids against Hamburg as part of its wider strategy of area bombing German cities. The aim was to demoralise the workingclass part of the population to cripple the armaments industry that was central to the German war effort and to bring civilian life to a halt. The US air force joined the attack with two daylight air raids mainly against targets in the harbour. The greatest damage was not done by the bombs themselves but the conflagration they caused on the ground. According to conservative estimates at least 34000 people died during this short series of attacks. Hamburg was largely reduced to rubble and nearly a million people fled the city. Among the victims of the attacks were thousands of forced labourers from central and eastern Europe who had been deported by the Nazis to Hamburg for work and who like the remaining Jews in the city were not allowed to take cover in the air raid shelters. After the attack entire districts of Hamburg were walled off and declared as death zones. The Nazis then forced inmates of the nearby Neuengamme concentration camp to find and defuse unexploded bombs clear the rubble and remove and bury the dead bodies. Hundreds of them died during this extremely dangerous and traumatic mission. Hamburg in 1943 after Operation Gomorrah. Photograph Galerie BilderweltGetty Images It is impossible to study the eyewitness reports from the summer of 1943 without feeling a sense of horror. But it would be deeply irresponsible to forget the context in which the attacks took place. This is why the ruin of St Nikolai is today a memorial not only to those who suffered in Hamburg in 1943 but to all victims of the war Germany started and fought with brutal disregard for civilian life exterminating vast parts of the Jewish population in Europe and bombing cities such as Warsaw London or Coventry without mercy. The exhibition situated in the vault of St Nikolai explains this context as well as the strategy of the Royal Air Force leadership under Air Marshal Arthur Harris who hoped that area bombing would make a decisive difference towards winning the war  a victory that was anything but certain in 1943. It also includes testimonies from some of the British airmen on duty many of whom feared for their own lives during the mission. The pilots and aircrew bombing German cities ran an extremely high risk of being shot down or crashing. More than 55000 of them died during the war. King Charles has been involved in furthering UKGerman reconciliation for decades as was his mother the late Queen Elizabeth II. During his last visit to Hamburg as Prince of Wales in 1995 he visited the mass grave at Ohlsdorf cemetery where thousands of the victims of Operation Gomorrah are buried. This time the King will come in his new role as head of state in a year that marks the 80th anniversary of a specific allied attack against Hamburg. The visit shows that the war is now so firmly in the past and the relationship between Britain and Germany so close that the King and the German president can afford to rise above the political controversies that have complicated the remembrance of the bombing campaigns in both countries for decades. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans  from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

In Germany the political far right has repeatedly tried to capture and weaponise the memory of the air war in a transparent and revolting attempt to weigh the suffering of civilians against Nazi Germanys guilt for the war and the Holocaust. It takes courage to remember. Facing up to historic reality in all its painful complexity is not the same as attributing blame or seeking absolution. To explain and understand is not to excuse or condemn. When you enter St Nikolai today the first thing you see is a Cross of Nails a gift from Coventry Cathedral together with a plaque from the citizens of Hamburg remembering the dead and emphasising that they do not forget the harm caused by their own madness. For the king to join in this remembrance is a very significant and much appreciated thing to do. At a time when many politicians all over the world like to pick and choose from history with the sole aim of suiting their narratives it matters. This article was amended on 30 March 2023 to remove a reference to the bombing of Guernica which happened in 1937 before the start of the second world war.,King Charles III will not only travel to Berlin during his state visit to Germany this week but also Hamburg the countrys second largest city and home to its biggest port.

Rishi Sunak may have no better luck stopping the small boats with his plan to put refugees on barges or send them to Rwanda. But the extent to which governments will go to defend their borders shows just how hot a political topic migration has become across developed western countries. Nor is it just the case in the US and UK. Sweden and Germany have seen the emergence of antiimmigration parties in recent years as the number of migrants has increased. In the case of the UK net migration  the numbers arriving minus the numbers leaving  has been positive for the past three decades. According to figures from the House of Commons library immigration exceeded emigration by more than 100000 in every year from 1998 to 2020. Boosted by oneoff factors such as the war in Ukraine net migration hit a record of just over 500000 in the year to last June. This 30year trend marked a break with the past. In the 1960s and 1970s more people left Britain than arrived and it was only in the early 1990s that net migration really started to increase. This is perhaps understandable. There was mass unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s and the UK was not the most attractive place for someone looking for work. But the UK economy grew uninterruptedly from 1992 to 2008 and there were plenty of jobs of the highpaid variety in the post big bang City of London and of the lowpaid variety in hospitality and social care. This was also the period when globalisation took off with cheap goods from newly openedup lowcost countries  such as China  boosting consumer purchasing power in western economies. The prosperity of the developed world was not lost on those in lowerincome countries leading inevitably to more people seeking to find a better standard of living in Europe or North America. In a way higher net migration into the west was the flipside of capital flows out of it to the emerging world. The money went one way people went the other. By no means all the people arriving in the UK come to work. Indeed only about a third cite that reason with a slightly higher proportion coming to study and much of the rest seeking asylum. Even so net migration has increased the size of the labour force and filled vacancies that might otherwise have gone unfilled. Under the new postBrexit arrangements which scrapped free movement for EU citizens and introduced a pointsbased system for work visas net migration has gone up. In Britain  and elsewhere  this raises two questions. The first is whether the level of net migration matters. From a freemarket perspective it does not because labour  like capital  should be allowed to find its way to the parts of the world where it can be most productively employed. Demographic change means populations in the west are getting older and the lack of available workers is adding to inflationary pressure. So why not allow migrant labour to plug the gaps? In reality no mainstream political party agrees with this approach not least because unrestricted immigration strains the developed countrys social infrastructure especially housing. It also deprives developing countries of their brightest workers. The corollary of open borders  at least in a small country such as Britain  is that the planning laws would need to be liberalised so that millions of new homes could be built to accommodate a growing population. Otherwise demand for property would massively exceed supply and houseprice inflation would rocket. The prevailing economic model  low wages and expensive rents for those at the bottom coupled with soaring property prices for the better off  would be further entrenched. There is though a second question how should governments in the west seek to manage migration? The stock answer is by improving education and training so that domestic workers eventually do the jobs currently done by migrants coupled with strictly policed quotas for sectors hardest hit by labour shortages. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  well point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

It does though ignore the fact that the desire to move to the west has almost certainly intensified as a result of the overlapping crises of recent years. Climate breakdown which has a disproportionate impact on lowincome countries is bound to increase this pressure. The head of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva said last week her organisation had revised down growth projections for lowincome countries where per capita income growth was falling further behind the rates needed to catch up with advanced economies. This threatens to reverse a decadeslong trend of steadily converging living standards she said. David Malpass the World Bank president was equally gloomy noting that 700 million  almost 10 of the global population  were living on less than 2 a day. Both the IMF and the World Bank are urging developed nations to do more to help poor countries build economic resilience but these appeals are more often than not falling on deaf ears. There is a lack of urgency about finding a solution to the looming debt crisis or in providing the resources needed to tackle the impact of global heating. Sunak talks tough on immigration but is doing little to reduce the incentives for people to come here in the first place. It would be naive to expect instant results from a less pennypinching approach but after cuts to aid the government is spending five times more on refugees in the UK than it is spending on assistance to Africa. This represents a classic case of false economy because any shortterm gains to the Treasury will be dwarfed by the longerterm costs.,Donald Trump never did manage to build the wall on the USs southern border.

She was a campaigner with an eye only for the subject and never for her byline. It was this that made her effective in the world. She wrote of her mother Marion Guttman a refugee from Nazi Germany in Five Houses an effortlessly elegant 2006 essay in Granta magazine. Marion she said lost her identity her nationality and a large fortune. In her the shock has engendered pragmatism rather than nostalgia. It did not engender pragmatism or nostalgia in her daughter.

Any detention without charge is unacceptable and that of children doubly so. In the London Review of Books she detailed how the law of joint enterprise could tangle the innocent as well as the guilty. In the Guardian and Observer and on television she repeatedly returned to the case of Ben Needham. He was the toddler who vanished from the Greek island of Kos in 1991. From the 1990s into the 2010s in print and on television she covered the story and detailed the complex lives of the family that had been left with that still unresolved mystery. She highlighted foreign prisoners in British jails and whether Gulf war syndrome in soldiers was the result of exposure to chemical weapons agents she interviewed Stephen Frears in the Oldie.

Over the years she contributed to many more papers magazines organisations and television companies. These included the Sunday Times the Daily Telegraph the Bureau of Investigative Journalism Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. From 2001 to 2015 she taught journalism at City University of London. And at City it was that ability to draw people in to make connections that marked her influence on generations of students.

I have dark hair and had I not had cancer and gone bald I would never have known how much fun it is being blond. I bought a cheap but stylish platinum wig from World of Wigs. My son said I looked like Pauline Fowler in EastEnders. I sometimes cover my driving mistakes with rude hand gestures but as a platinum blonde I had no need. Born in London Melanie was the second daughter of Colin McFadyean an international lawyer and wartime naval officer and Marion who arrived in England in 1937 and would later earn her living in everything from picture restoration to garden design. The couple divorced in 1960. Melanie was educated at Sherborne school for girls in Dorset but was expelled after a year and joined her sister Andrea at Cranborne Chase school in Wiltshire which has since closed. It was she wrote in Granta such a degenerate and lawless place that I had to go in search of the rules in order to break them. It took me two and a half years to get expelled.

This time the stakes werent as high but another trophy was secured and Sarina Wiegmans unbeaten run was extended to 30 games with the Dutch manager yet to experience defeat with her European champions. A stunning team goal finished by Ella Toone had torn apart the Copa Amrica Femenina champions Brazil in the first half but Andressa Alvess injurytime strike forced a shootout. Goalkeeper Mary Earps would atone for her fumble conceding the goal by stopping Tamires strike and watching as Brazil captain Rafaelles shot smashed off the bar before Kelly sealed the victory in Englands first shootout since 2011. It was another test passed another box ticked off and another crowdpleasing result as England continued their march towards the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand which kicks off in 105 days. It was a strong starting XI from the England manager who had hinted that there would be less room for experimentation against Brazil and Australia than there had been at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. Excluding injuries she fielded a team very close to the one that will probably feature at the World Cup in July with Millie Brights absence allowing Alex Greenwood to start alongside centreback Leah Williamson and Jess Carter slotting in at leftback. Meanwhile Lauren James got the nod ahead of Kelly to start in place of longterm absentee Beth Mead. Leah Williamson and Mary Earps lift the Womens Finalissima trophy at Wembley. Photograph Tom JenkinsThe Guardian Six of the XI that started the Euro 2022 final last year remained. There were six changes from the Brazil team that secured an eighth Copa Amrica Femenina the day before the Lionesses Euros triumph. Brazil were without key players Marta Ludmila and Debinha for the trip to England though while the Copa Amrica top scorer Adriana was a surprise omission from the starting lineup. It is a testament to the impact of the Euros win that Wembley was awash with fans by lunchtime for the 7.45pm kickoff. It is an even bigger testament that that no longer feels strange. A soldout Wembley is the Lionesses new normal and it is accelerating the growth of the game beyond anyones wildest expectations. Investment support structural change and time has built the success on the pitch delivering the environment in which the players can thrive. Brazil meanwhile are still waiting for that lightbulb moment. Their manager Pia Sundhage pointed to that prior to the match saying it was time that Brazil steps up and lays the foundations for future success. On the pitch at Wembley it was Englands flair and not the Brazil teams that had the crowd drooling. A beautifully worked team goal in the 23rd minute was the result. It took five passes to take the ball from back to front and James was key releasing Lucy Bronze on the right. The fullback played a onetwo with Georgia Stanway before pulling the ball back into the middle of the box for Toone to glide in. Jamess inclusion ahead of an inform Kelly was both a surprise and expected at the same time. The 21yearold Chelsea forward has been in phenomenal form and the magic that makes her arguably the most technically gifted English footballer since Kelly Smith was on display against Brazil. Every time James gets on the ball no matter the space available or the players around her the casual ease with which she can shrug off an opponent wriggle free and provide the unexpected makes her a potent weapon. There was a sign of the bright England future of James not long after the halfhour mark with a flick on for Bronze who sent it back to her to lift over Letcia into the roof of the net. The move was beautiful but James was offside and the fine finish was consigned to the dustbin of history. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter Informative passionate entertaining.

The decision to change clothing rules around swimming in the German capital was made after two women including Mies filed complaints about being thrown out or barred from the citys pools for refusing to cover up and demanded the same rights as their male counterparts when bathing obenohne topless at the citys public pools. Berlin resident Mies 33 filed a discrimination complaint last December against a Kaulsdorf indoor pool after she was barred from entering topless. The 33yearold said she emailed in advance and was given permission to bathe topless. However when Mies went topless at the pool staff asked her to leave. Mies said she protested that the rules only prescribe wearing commercial bathing suits and that she was allowed but police were summoned and the lifeguard who originally gave her the green light barred Mies from the pool. A correct interpretation of the bathing rules  Lotte Mies at Kaulsdorf pool in Berlin. Photograph Gerald Matzkadpa Mies described feeling humiliated as she left and contacted the citys department for justice diversity and antidiscrimination. Her complaint prompted a rule change after the department found that Mies had correctly interpreted the bathing rules and the decision was made to explicitly add that anyone regardless of gender could be topless at the public pools. I felt very humiliated and that my dignity as a human being was discriminated against because I am a woman so that certain things and premises were denied to me due to unwritten moral codes that men imposed on women that are still in effect today Mies told the Guardian. It is important to understand that not allowing people the same rights because of their gender is not a matter of opinion but an act of structural sexism. Everyone should have the same opportunity and above all freedom of choice especially when it comes to their own body Mies continued. The German capitals authorities made clear that the existing rule which insists that bathing costumes cover the genitals applies to all visitors and that anyone can choose whether to wear a full swimsuit or just bottoms at the pools. Now it has been laid down that this regulation is always applied in accordance with the principle of equal treatment of all genders. There are no longer different ways of interpreting the common practice but every guest of our swimming pools now has the possibility to decide for themselves which kind of swimwear they want to wear Berlins swimming pool operator Berliner Bderbetriebe said. The move follows a similar incident in Berlin in 2021 in which a French woman living in the city Gabrielle Lebreton was ordered to leave a water park when she refused to cover up her breasts while sunbathing. It sparked a no nipple is free until all nipples are free protest where women rode bikes topless and men wore bras to demonstrate against the double standard. Mies celebrated the rule change but said there was still a lot to be done to secure equal rights for all genders. The main problem with the whole topic is that women are exposed to permanent sexualisation and this is equated with sexual availability and they are treated accordingly. This is the real scandal. We as a society must counteract this socialisation and stop treating women as objects and start respecting them she added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration featured trips and local tips for your next break as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

For more than a century Germany has practised Freikrperkultur FKK which translates as free body culture. Arnd Bauerkmper associate professor of modern history at the Free University of Berlin told the BBC that at the turn of the 20th century nudism was part of a movement to be closer to nature. Bauerkmper said that for Germans living in communist East Germany FKK functioned in part as a safety valve  a way to release tension in a restrictive state by providing an opportunity for some free movement. Berliner Bderbetriebe said it welcomed tourists to the city and its public pools and asked guests to practise mutual respect and tolerance when visiting. Veteran German leftwing politician Gregor Gysi spoke out a few years ago about his disappointment in the decline of FKK saying it was the pornographic gaze of westerners after reunification that destroyed the pleasure of nude bathing. He called on local German governments to do more to protect FKK areas of beaches and spas. Berlin is not the only German city to allow topless swimming. In May 2022 Gttingen in Lower Saxony central Germany became the first German city to allow female topless swimming in its indoor and outdoor pools after a swimmer who identified as male was turned away from a public pool for wanting to swim with their chest bare. Following a brief test phase the regulation is now being continued permanently.,When a lifeguard asked police to remove Lotte Mies for bathing topless at her local indoor swimming pool in Berlin it was a move that would inadvertently trigger a rule change allowing all women including visiting female tourists the freedom to go topless while swimming in the city. The decision to change clothing rules around swimming in the German capital was made after two women including Mies filed complaints about being thrown out or barred from the citys pools for refusing to cover up and demanded the same rights as their male counterparts when bathing obenohne topless at the citys public pools. Berlin resident Mies 33 filed a discrimination complaint last December against a Kaulsdorf indoor pool after she was barred from entering topless.

The qualifiers begin on 23 March with Kazakhstan against Slovenia. These will be the first international matches after the World Cup which was attractive in sporting terms but controversial in Europe. Qatar benefits from football for its political goals. We should do the same. The 2024 European Championship being in the heart of Europe offers the ideal opportunity to do so. Germany welcomes the continent and seeks to defend it with the common achievements that make it strong. The tournament obliges us to put football back in the spotlight. Fans want a purity and simplicity that goes back to the essentials play sport fun togetherness. One ball one team clear rules. Football has been a unifying element in Europe for more than a century. It is a constant driver of equal opportunities diversity and freedom. In times of polarisation and division in our societies it is all the more important to strengthen this. Football provides many vivid political analogies how does an individual behave in a group? What freedom does the game provide in the face of the imperative to conform to a tactic? How do rules shape our coexistence? If youre talking about football youre talking about social sustainability. You dont win anything on your own. Every child who plays football understands that. That football works as a game was experienced in Qatar. The best teams had an identity. Argentina radiated joy and determination you could tell they knew what they were running for their teammates and their country. Appreciation comes from the respect of others and when everyone realises that their contribution is important they fight. For France Olivier Giroud became a role model. In the final he was substituted before the break. It was the coachs admission that he had chosen the wrong strategy. That is a blow for every athlete he only accepts something like that when there is a bigger goal and he understands that it needs a new attempt. Afterwards Giroud acted in solidarity and rooted for the team from the bench. He had understood the coachs decision. He also knows that in France as in every European country football has a social significance. In such cases a football tournament leaves its mark on the nation and the whole thing is amplified for a long time when the hosts are involved. So the responsibility for Germany is enormous especially given their team were knocked out early in the past three tournaments. There was no lack of talent but there was a lack of leadership a lack of a we and a why. What does it mean to be a national player? What does football mean for our common good? These are important questions often forgotten. Fans embraced the German national womens football team despite them losing out to England in the Womens Euro 2022 final. Photograph Andre PainAFPGetty Images The national team are different from a club team. There is three times as much money involved in the big clubs as there was 10 years ago. The national team meanwhile have to escape the logic of growth. It cannot be about higher bonuses. A player who earns an annual salary of 15m20m does not need 200000 or 400000. A national player should know their duties. The child in the jersey and the volunteer in the amateur club want to see themselves represented by him or her. If he or she gives them something he or she gets something back. I remember when millions of people celebrated us and also themselves in 2006. This attachment in turn creates an added value for the players that money cannot buy that can protect you in this tough business in more difficult days. The love that Lionel Messi is now experiencing from Argentina will not exist for him in Paris. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

An underdog is welcome to surprise as Iceland did in 2016. Everyone remembers their primal scream. A tournament such as this can create a spirit of optimism. After the pandemic Russias attack on Ukraine and the energy crisis it would be good if we all rediscovered ourselves together. Only if we in all our diversity stick together will we defy the crises and conflicts. Adaptation is needed to the new challenges of climate change and geopolitics. Every football team whether in the Champions League the district league or in the workplace is a piece in the mosaic. The present is a Zeitenwende a turning point. Europe has to reflect on itself. Perhaps many people hadnt realised before now how fortunate it is that we can host a tournament in a democracy again. Every professional footballer should realise the advantages of our way of life.

This was the only real entertainment on show invalid entertainment. There was one of these moments shortly before Englands opening goal as Harry Maguire chased back to retrieve a loose ball then just seemed to stop. Except it wasnt that. Maguire hadnt actually stopped. There he was still going still turning like a fullyladen container ship easing its way grandly out of port. Were still on. This was just Maguire attempting to sprint. Nothing came of it and Maguire wasnt really asked to chase again all game. He defended well otherwise showing his strengths in passing heading and reading the angles. But if these games leading towards Germany 2024 really are about refinement about elevating Englands level towards genuine rather than hopeful tournament favourites that slowmotion tableau football through a mild dose of horse tranquilliser was still probably one the most significant moments of a mismatched afternoon. This England team is evolving. It has deeper gears than at any stage in the last seven years. But it is also time for Gareth Southgate to make some final calculations to be ruthless when it comes to the balance of loyalty and weaknesses. And Maguire remains the most obvious knot to be untangled. It was a pretty useful few days for other reasons too as lateseason limbweary international breaks go. England have all but nailed a toptwo spot in the group. Some areas of quiet progress made in Qatar seem to have bedded in. There was even something fascinating and fun in the contrast of the two venues the first in Naples a place of strange energy fields and fishy sidestreets  the air doesnt just smell of puttanesca sauce it tastes of it  and a city where on match days nobody ever really seems to be totally in control of anything and the second at Wembley where stewarding has become ever more neurotic after the chaos of 2021 where a neighbourhood booze lockdown is now enforced by hivis squadrons where a piped voice tells you how to walk act move and where the ground had begun to empty out with 70 minutes gone. On the pitch there were some obvious signs of progress. Although this must as ever be filtered through the fact that looking at Southgates England is very much a SpeakMyTruth kind of affair a world where however you feel about Southgates achievements as manager thats what they are. Never mind facts history or context. It is an easy game to play. Made England better when they were dreadful? Wouldve happened anyway. Reached a final? Didnt win a final. Won in Italy? Fine. Win better in Italy win all the minutes of all the games. But Southgate himself seemed genuinely refreshed and replenished. This is not a trivial point. So much about teams and shared competitive will relates to how the people at the centre of it feel. Second and more tangible was the regearing of Englands midfield a longterm point of weakness that now looks like an area of strength. The threeman unit strangled Italy in the first half Jude Bellingham Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips establishing a suffocating white shield around halfway pressing cutting the angles stalling opposition attempts to build some rhythm. Jude Bellingham left and Declan Rice challenge Ukraines midfield during the Euro 2024 qualifiers. Photograph Justin TallisAFPGetty Images This is a midfield Southgate had wanted to use in Qatar. And while Bellingham is the obvious star and Rice had arguably his best England game in Naples Phillips is also a key part. Southgate was accused of the dreaded sin of loyalty for selecting him. But this happened because Phillips has the mobility and skill set to help make this shape work with all the referred benefits of fewer defenders on the pitch. That 433 is Southgate finding a way to loosen the tie tousle his hair and rev the throttle. It might take time. But it is the right kind of progress. One key England weakness an absence of control that led at times to seven defensive players on the pitch is being rounded out here. Which brings us back to Maguire. Southgate is often accused of being too loyal to his preferred players. To some degree this is another case of the truth being whatever you choose to see. On one hand Southgates key note of progress is creating a club culture abolishing the old fear divisions and insecurity. On the other we want him to drop players to pick only on form to give us new things to look at. Maguire has stayed in the team in part for these reasons. But he is a genuine problem now for England his lack of mobility an obvious weak spot just waiting to be exposed by the best team or if not skewing selection to hide it. And Southgate must know that this version of Maguire is a level below what this team can aim for. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

But he is also the slowest player on the pitch every time he plays and not just slow in foot race slow in anything that requires him to flex and spring. This immobility will cost England if not in obvious ways then in the problems with keeping a high defensive line and condensing the midfield. At times at Wembley John Stones could be seen urging Maguire forward when England had possession. Grudgingly Maguire complied already feeling vertigo. Perhaps there isnt a genuinely compelling leftsided centreback alternative. Fikayo Tomori has played well for Milan. Southgate seems to be concerned that he lacks Maguires strength and power in the air. Tomori also had two shaky games against Chelsea at just the wrong moment. But this point of weakness will continue to lurk more evident in a team that has fewer of them. Loyalty is good. Ruthlessness is also good and Southgate has been ruthless in some ways. Raheem Sterling has finally been eased out of an automatic starter spot. And Englands manager has no matter what he might say publicly been ruthless with Ben White who left the World Cup squad and wasnt picked for these games as an understandable consequence. Can Southgate now apply the other side of that hardheadedness? White is a centreback by trade. He is currently playing to a high standard every week for the Premier League leaders. On merit an English defender with a shot at winning the English league and in a role that is a point of weakness he deserves a chance to play for England. It is up to Southgate to make this work or at least to give it a chance. White or indeed any other potential replacement doesnt have to be a worldbeater. The central defence only needs to be quite good to be athletic and secure enough to make the team work slightly better. England have eight more games before the year is out. If Maguires own form doesnt improve there is plenty of time to fix this to be ruthless in just the right way.,At times during the opening halfhour of Englands slowburn 20 defeat of Ukraine the only real football on show was that very modern kind of nonfootball the things that happen in the strange dead time while everyone in the stadium waits for the assistant referee to raise the flag for offside.

Lee Carsleys side were bidding to sign off for Georgia with a fourth friendly win out of four having beaten Germany Italy and on Saturday thumping France 40. But Carsley changed all 10 outfield players for their last tuneup match and they had only a late Morgan GibbsWhite consolation from the penalty spot to show for a ragged display at Craven Cottage. It is not just the senior England side who have recent history with Croatia the under21s were on course for the quarterfinals at the last Euros when a lastgasp wonder strike from fullback Domagoj Bradaric knocked them out on goal difference despite a 21 win. Curtis Jones scored in that match and the Liverpool youngster had Englands first shot on target repelled by goalkeeper Dominik Kotarski after a cross by Manchester Citys Cole Palmer. The lively Palmer then teed up Tommy Doyle who could not recreate his spectacular longrange FA Cup winner for Sheffield United against Blackburn nine days ago with his shot this time flying over the crossbar. Instead Croatia took the lead in the 34th minute after debutant Rico Lewis was booked for bringing down Lukas Kacavenda outside the box. Martin Baturina stepped up to curl a superb 20yard freekick inside James Traffords near post. Carsley made just one change at halftime replacing Boltons onloan Manchester City keeper Trafford and handing West Broms Josh Griffiths a debut. But Griffiths first task was to face a penalty after Luke Thomas clumsily brought down Matija Frigan in the area. Dion Drena Beljo coolly sent Griffiths the wrong way from the spot to double Croatias lead. Griffiths did well to limit the damage with a smart pointblank save to deny Kacavenda and another fine stop to keep out Gabriel Vidovic. For the hosts Palmer and Jacob Ramsey both stung the hands of Kotarski who then pulled off a stunning save to keep out a header from the substitute GibbsWhite. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Addressing more than 1100 shareholders at the St Jakobshalle arena in Mnchenstein near Basel Switzerland UBS bosses said they understood why investors may be bewildered or even angry after the surprise deal that was announced on 19 March and followed weeks of panic about the health of the banking sector. It was a historic day and a day we hoped would not happen the chair of UBS Colm Kelleher said. Yet it is a significant milestone not only for UBS and Credit Suisse but also for Switzerland for the global financial industry. While Kelleher acknowledged the governmentorchestrated deal came with risks he defended the takeover and said it presented a business opportunity for UBS. However bosses said all options were on the table such as a future split or spinoff of Credit Suisse assets. Some shareholders acknowledged the potential benefits of the takeover but said they were concerned about this new giant bank which is expected to hold a combined 5tn 4tn in invested assets including the possibility of unjustified pay hikes and job cuts. e This will in no way justify any inflation of remuneration one shareholder said urging bosses to be prudent even as they prepared to manage a muchlarger bank. The current plan are already extremely generous the shareholder added. Investors also raised the alarm about thousands of potential job cuts as bosses try to get rid of duplicate roles. Those synergies you were referring to would potentially costs more than 30000 jobs worldwide a shareholder said referring to recent press reports. These social consequences also in Switzerland could be dramatic and the reputation of UBS could also suffer. Banking is people dont forget that another investor added.

The talks between postal service bosses and the Communications Workers Union CWU at the Westminsterbased Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service ended after 1am on Wednesday with the two sides failing to reach agreement on pay and conditions. The dispute has lasted for almost a year with 18 days of strikes held between August and the end of 2022. The CWU won a strong mandate to take further action in a member ballot in February and its leaders were last week considering further strikes in April if talks failed. Its postal executive will meet on Wednesday to discuss further options. The latest negotiations were led by Dave Ward the CWUs general secretary and several Royal Mail board members although the chief executive Simon Thompson and chair Keith Williams were not directly involved. The company on Wednesday said it had increased its offer to the union but that it was not an option to carry on without significant changes. The CWU said that unacceptable pressures were being placed on postal workers. Royal Mail is owned by the recently renamed International Distributions Systems IDS the FTSE 250 company created when the postal service was privatised. IDS has said that Royal Mail the part that runs the UKs regulated letter delivery business is expected to lose between 350m and 400m this year and had even raised the possibility of putting the company into a form of administration if talks fell through. Royal Mail may face more strikes as talks with union end without deal Read more A source close to Royal Mail said the final breakdown related to differences in terms and conditions for new employees who were paid less than longerserving staff. The company had offered to bring new employees to pay parity over five years but the CWU wanted parity within three years the source said. However the CWU argued that was a selective account. A spokesperson said The company advised the union that the directors who have been leading negotiations are no longer available and that the board will be meeting today to determine their next steps. There has been progress in several areas and the union made it clear last night that we are willing to continue negotiations today and tomorrow to finalise an agreement. This offer has been reiterated to the company this morning.

Anna Isaac The Confederation of British Industry CBI is the UKs most prominent business lobbying organisation. It is a notforprofit organisation founded by royal charter in 1965 after a merger of older employer bodies. It claims unrivalled access to government. It also claims to have the biggest number of policy specialists outside of Whitehall the seat of the British government in order to support its 190000 business members which are the chief source of its income. Its total income was 25m in 2021 of which 22m was from membership fees. Its membership is composed of direct members and members of other trade bodies. Its 1500 direct members are businesses that actively hold membership such as the supermarket Asda the jet engines manufacturer RollsRoyce and the law firm Allen  Overy. Fees vary significantly toptier businesses can pay 90000 annually some midsized companies pay half this price and smaller companies pay far less. The bulk of its membership comes via trade bodies such as the National Farmers Union and the Federation of Master Builders. The CBI counts these trade bodies memberships within its own 190000 total. The lobby group has access to the prime minister and cabinet and campaigns on issues ranging from funding for childcare to tax and skills. Its relationship with the UK government was stretched severely by Brexit with its access to Number 10 much curtailed. A remark attributed to the former prime minister Boris Johnson  fuck business  was considered to be aimed at efforts by the CBI and others to try to influence the postBrexit UKEU trade agreement. Its former director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn sought to rebuild ties with the government during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic including working alongside trade unions and No 10 on developing the furlough scheme. Tony Danker took over from Fairbairn the CBIs first female boss in November 2020. He continued a focus on reengaging with the government and the opposition Labour party. He was criticised for speaking in support of Liz Trusss disastrous minibudget in September 2022. The CBI is governed by a president and an executive committee which in normal times is chaired by the director general. It also has a board of nonexecutive directors which the director general sits on. 5 Apr 2023 12.13 BST Weve got confirmation that the Treasury and the Department for Business and Trade have postponed meetings with the Confederation of British Industry CBI while the business group investigates allegations of sexual misconduct. 5 Apr 2023 11.52 BST Treasury and business department postpone meetings with CBI after Guardians sexual misconduct claims UPDATE THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

The latest allegations of misconduct by senior figures at the CBI are separate to those made about its director general Tony Danker last month. Updated at 12.16 BST 5 Apr 2023 11.12 BST Royal Mail says talks end without a deal Royal Mail said after 11 months of talks with the Communication Workers Union over pay and changes to working patterns negotiations have ended without a deal. A spokesperson said After 11 months of talks including mediation by Sir Brendan Barber and Acas we are deeply concerned that our talks with CWU have concluded without an agreement. We made substantial efforts to reach an agreement including making a number of further improvements to our offer. These improvements were all based on feedback from the CWU and we were hopeful that the CWU would put a deal to its members. We remain committed to reaching an agreement with the CWU. We have been clear throughout the dispute that not transforming our network and working practices is not an option in a business losing more than 1 million a day. In the best interests of the business our customers and the job security of our postmen and women change cannot be delayed any further. 5 Apr 2023 11.10 BST UK services growth slows despite record export sales The UKs service sector has been growing for three months according to a survey but showed a slowdown last month despite record export growth. The SP GlobalCIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 52.9 last month down from Februarys 53.5. Any reading above 50 points to expansion any reading below suggests a contraction. The businesses polled reported their biggest jump in export sales since the survey started tracking this in September 2014. Tim Moore economics director at SP Global Market Intelligence which compiles the survey said March data confirmed that the UK service sector returned to growth during the first quarter of 2023 supported by a sustained rebound in new orders as business and consumer confidence improved from the lows seen last autumn. Export sales provided an additional boost to the service economy during March as the ongoing recovery in business travel and events helped to drive the fastest rise in new orders from abroad for at least eight and a half years. Increases in prices that service companies charged dropped to a 19month low in March but this was still higher than at any point between 1996 when the survey began and 2021. Increases in costs faced by these businesses eased to the lowest level for 22 months but remained exceptionally strong the survey said.,From 5 Apr 2023 12.46 BST UK government suspends relationship with CBI Richard Partington The government has suspended its relationship with the Confederation of British Industry as pressure mounts after the Guardian revealed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by the lobby groups staff.

While Sara is leftfooted and plays in central defence Karen favours her right foot and anchors midfield but back in the dressing room the pairs similarities far outweigh the differences. Even Evertons manager Brian Srensen has been known to confuse one identical twin with the other. Being left and rightfooted is the biggest difference. Im maybe a bit quieter but otherwise were nearly the same says Sara before Karen interjects. I have a higher bun she points out gesturing to her hair. But were just enjoying being here together its something special. The Holmgaards relish following the path set by their similarly identical male football counterparts Jacob and Josh Murphy who played together at Norwich for a time and Michael and Will Keane once regular fixtures in assorted Manchester United and England youth teams. In the womens sphere a precedent was set by the Kmita twins Mollie and Rosie although that pair have now swapped West Ham for sports broadcasting. As the Holmgaards prepare for Friday nights Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park retirement is the last thing on the 24yearolds minds but they accept they are unlikely to synchronise their entire careers. Indeed they have only recently been reunited after being divided for the first time when Sara spent the first half of this season on loan at Denmarks Fortuna Hjrring. Although strictly temporary this parting of the ways proved a useful exercise in independence for the Danish siblings who had previously played together at Hjrring and Germanys Turbine Potsdam. It was our first time without each other and yeah of course it was a good thing says Sara. We learned a lot about a lot of things. We expected it to be difficult and it was hard  but not as hard as I imagined. It was nice to try to live alone and also to show people outside that we can be apart. Karen Holmgaard right in action against Manchester United in October while Sara was away on loan. Photograph Emma SimpsonEverton FCGetty Images Karen believes the dual Denmark internationals have now achieved a perfect balance at their shared apartment in Liverpools fashionable docklands area. Sometimes I go out with a friend and Sara stays at home she says. But we have a lot of the same friends so were often all chilling together. Sara is particularly appreciative of her new habitat. The cultures different to Germany she says. Personally I love to be here. The people are so warm and friendly. Theyre just kind its good to be among them. The football culture in Germany was tough too. The games were a lot about power but in England although the intensitys the same theres a lot more possession. In Germany we had a lot of running in training but here its much more tactical. As Karen emphasises it also helps that the pair previously worked with Srensen at Hjrring. I think he was the main thing for us to move over here last summer she says. We had Brian for two years before and we really enjoyed that time. He supports us and we just like him as a manager. But even after working with Brian for so long there are still times when we confuse him. Perhaps most memorably at Hjrring Sorensen once congratulated Sara for a goal scored by Karen. At school people couldnt see the difference says the latter. So sometimes we did something funny and tricked them. During that childhood in Mid Jutland the duo excelled at both football and handball and it was only after a joint postcollege discussion that they opted to pursue mutual success in the former with their neartelepathic onpitch connectivity and intertwin competitiveness helping secure them senior Denmark debuts in 2019. We wouldnt have this life now if we hadnt each pushed the other on acknowledges Sara. After joint involvement in Euro 2022 they hope to be on the plane to this summers World Cup in Australia and New Zealand where Denmark face England in a groupstage game in Sydney. Its going to be tough says Karen. England are good. I think theyre better than us right now but well see.

The Gunners face an inform team with a formidable home record on Tuesday evening but the Swede sounded confident and pointed to his teams results in the group stage as a reason why they should approach the game in a positive frame of mind. Bayern have won 12 of their past 13 Champions League games at home and are on a run of 12 consecutive home victories in all competitions. Asked why Bayern are so difficult to face in Germany Eidevall said Mainly because they are a good team  but weve been playing against teams who have great home records to be fair such as Juventus and Lyon this season and we managed to draw in Turin and won in Lyon. So we have respect for that Bayerns good home record but should not fear it. Arsenal are looking to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2013 and Eidevall feels that a recent minibreak has helped the team to prepare well for the fixture. Arsenal have not played since beating Reading 40 on 12 March. We have tried to use it in the best way possible a mixture of getting some time off to recover but also to use the time as efficiently as possible to work on things in our game not only for this game but for the other games we have ahead of us he said. It has been really good to work with the squad and hopefully we can show tomorrow that we are well prepared. I have had a feeling lately that I am sharing less information with the players because I am more sure that we know what to do in those situations. Lets hope that is a good sign and not a sign of false security. Bayern Munichs Sarah Zadrazil said she was excited to play in the Allianz Arena.

A couple of years ago it campaigned against proposals for a national speed limit on autobahns  a move that would have helped reduce Germanys CO 2 emissions. But as a coalition partner in Olaf Scholzs Social Democratled government it is taking environmental obstructionism to a new level. The FDP is the driving force behind German opposition to Brussels plans to ban sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035. Until this month the date was considered a done deal and constitutes a vital pillar of the EUs strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. But Germany is now insisting that the European Commission offers a getout clause allowing car manufacturers to carry on producing the engines if they can find a way to deliver carbonneutral efuels to run them. The highly technical nature of this debate risks obscuring its dangerous implications for Europes climate ambitions. In the context of economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine there are disturbing signs that the mood music on net zero targets is changing. Italys prime minister Giorgia Meloni has begun to talk darkly about the potential impact of the environmental push on the countrys economic fabric. Her deputy Matteo Salvini has described the timetable for transition to electric vehicles as economic and social suicide and a gift to China. The danger is that where Germany has selfinterestedly led regarding its own flagship industry other countries with their own preoccupations may follow. In the Netherlands the success of a profarmer party at recent elections has led to speculation that a pledge by The Hague to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 may not be met. EU plans to reduce emissions from intensive agriculture more generally have been scaled down. Other green goals on chemicals and biodiversity are being challenged. Climate laggards such as Poland and Hungary whose governments have barely paid lip service to the 2050 zero emissions target are doubtless scenting the possibility of fruitful alliances. Rather than risk a prolonged and damaging standoff with Berlin it seems likely that Brussels will offer some heavily caveated concessions on cars. But as Germanys exasperated Green vicechancellor Robert Habeck reportedly observed this week this standoff has meant that the largest ever piece of EU climateprotected legislation is starting to be undone. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that the threshold 1.5C target for global warming is almost certain to be breached in the 2030s this is a very bad look indeed. Europe given its wealth and its industrial history bears a special responsibility in the battle to contain global heating. Hard times have undoubtedly made the politics of fulfilling net zero pledges more difficult and handed an opportunity to the populist right in particular. But the response cannot be to delay and water down necessary action in the hope that Mr Micawberstyle some new technology turns up to solve the problem.

The Competition and Markets Authority CMA said today it is examining whether Wowcher misled consumers by using countdown timers and other urgency claims. The probe will look into the use of timers telling shoppers that deals will soon disappear as well as other online selling practices used by the business including how it enrols consumers in its membership scheme. Sarah Cardell chief executive of the CMA said People who buy online should not be pressurised by practices implying that they must act quickly to avoid missing out when this is not the case. Well be scrutinising these claims from Wowcher and if we find the company is using misleading online selling tactics we wont hesitate to take enforcement action through the courts if necessary. This is the second investigation we have opened into urgency claims which can be a type of pressure selling and all companies should take note and review their own practices. Weve published advice to help with this which sets out clearly those online urgency and price reduction claims that are likely to mislead or put unfair pressure on consumers. A Wowcher spokesman said the company will work with the CMAs investigation Wowchers mission has always been to help save our customers money with the best exclusive offers from thousands of our merchants across the UK. This has never been more important than in this challenging economic environment.

The UNs office of the high commissioner for human rights has verified more than 8400 civilian deaths and more than 14000 civilians wounded but those figures are just the tip of the iceberg Trk said.

I believe its a plan that lays the foundations for a durable peace in Ukraine and is perfectly aligned with the United Nations charter and its principles which have been violated by Putin with his invasion Snchez said. I stressed the importance that Ukraine as a free and sovereign state should be the one to decide on the issues that affect it. Beijings plans were largely dismissed by leaders in the west. When asked about Chinas plan on Friday Snchez said he welcomed Beijings complete and total rejection of the threat and use of nuclear weapons in the conflict and its support for territorial integrity.

Podolyak posting to Twitter said any ceasefire that would allow Russia the right to stay in occupied territories of Ukraine would be totally inadmissible. He added Ukraine has the right to move troops and equipment on its territory as it deems necessary. Once again by points. Any ceasefire will mean RFs right to stay in the occupied territories. This is totally inadmissible...  has the right to move troops and equipment on its territory as it deems necessary. Weird peacekeepers look ridiculous.    PodolyakM March 31 2023 31 Mar 2023 14.53 BST Russias ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has rejected charges brought against President Vladimir Putin by the international criminal court ICC for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children. The ICC issued an arrest warrant earlier this month for Putin and his childrens rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna LvovaBelova for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children and their transfer from areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. It is unclear how many children have been taken from Ukraine by Russian forces. The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab published a report last month alleging that at least 6000 children from Ukraine had been sent to Russian reeducation camps in the past year. The ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said his office had identified the deportation of at least hundreds of children taken from orphanages and childrens care homes. Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has estimated the number of deported children at far more than 16000. Many of these children were taken from their parents at filtration points as they tried to leave newly captured territory removed from care institutions or taken from people who were caring for them after their parents were killed in the war. The Russian leadership has been overt about taking Ukrainian children to Russia and placing them in camps or putting them up for adoption by Russian families. Moscow says millions of people have chosen to move to Ukraine. Ambassador Nebenzia in an interview with Russias stateowned Tass news agency said We are talking about evacuation from a war zone in full compliance with obligations under international humanitarian law as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Millions of people have been evacuated in this way including children who in the overwhelming majority of cases arrive in Russian territory with their parents guardians and trustees. He accused western suggestions that such children had been adopted of being deliberately misleading adding In reality we are talking about temporary preliminary guardianship or temporary guardianship. The main goal is for children to be in families not in orphanages. This form was chosen specifically taking into account the potential reunification of minors with their blood relatives if any are found.

Reuters reports Speaking at an annual address to lawmakers and government officials Lukashenko said Moscows plans to station nuclear arms in Belarus would help safeguard the country which he said was under threat from the west. Take my word for it I have never deceived you. They are preparing to invade Belarus to destroy our country he told the audience. Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus its first deployment of nuclear armaments outside its borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Lukashenko went further saying he and the Russian president could decide if necessary to deploy strategic nuclear weapons  more powerful systems that can destroy whole cities from a range of thousands of miles  on Belarusian soil. Belarus said this week that the Russian tactical nuclear weapons would offer protection after what it called a campaign of pressure from the United States and its allies aimed at overthrowing Lukashenko who has been in power for nearly three decades. I am not trying to intimidate or blackmail anyone. I want to safeguard the Belarusian state and ensure peace to the Belarusian people Lukashenko said.

The countrys opposition leader in exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the move grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian presidents suggestions that the move would not breach nonproliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov the head of Ukraines national security and defence council called the deal a step towards internal destabilisation of Belarus and said it maximised what he termed the level of negative perception and public rejection of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage he wrote on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak another senior adviser to Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy mocked Putins plan saying the Russian leader was too predictable. Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus he admits that he is afraid of losing  all he can do is scare with tactics Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. Nato spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday Russias nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russias nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russias reference to Natos nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments. Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats or escalated nuclear rhetoric after the full invasion of Ukraine but this is the first time he has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko who he said had long raised the question of a nuclear deployment on his countrys territory. Earlier in the week Putin threatened a response to Britains announcement that it would supply Ukraine with armourpiercing tank shells made with depleted uranium and mentioned the shells again in his remarks on Saturday but his justification of the move rested mainly on the presence of about 100 US nuclear bombs in Europe. There is nothing unusual here either firstly the United States has been doing this for decades Putin said. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries. We agreed that we will do the same without violating our obligations  I emphasise without violating our international obligations on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Lukashenko staged a referendum in February last year revoking Belaruss nonnuclear status but the opposition rejected the vote as meaningless under conditions of political repression and following the 2020 presidential election that kept him in office generally agreed to have been rigged. Russias deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus directly violates the constitution of Belarus and grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to assume the nonnuclear state status expressed in the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus of 1990 Tsikhanouskaya said. This unacceptable development making Belarus a potential target for preventive or retaliation strikes became possible because of the illegal seizure of power by the illegitimate regime of Lukashenko. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Belarus it could face further sanctions if it hosted Russian nuclear weapons. Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions Borrell said in a tweet. Moscow has 5977 nuclear warheads in its inventory according to the Federation of American Scientists and has long had the capability to strike a target anywhere in the world. The US has slightly fewer at 5428. The Center for Arms Control and NonProliferation estimates that there are about 100 US nuclear weapons  airborne gravity bombs  stored in Europe across six bases in five countries although they are retained in US control. The US played down concerns about Putins announcement and the potential for Moscow to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance a senior US administration official said. The official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. Analysts at the Washingtonbased Institute for the Study of War ISW said in a note late on Saturday that the risk of escalation to nuclear war remained extremely low. They said ISW continues to assess that Putin is a riskaverse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through in order to break western resolve. However the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putins announcement an extremely dangerous escalation. In the context of the war in Ukraine the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences it said on Twitter. While the Belarusian army has not formally fought in Ukraine Minsk and Moscow have a close military relationship. Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine last year and the two nations stepped up joint military training. On Sunday Putin dismissed suggestions that Moscow was forging a military alliance with Beijing claiming instead that western powers were building a new axis similar to the partnership between Germany Italy and Japan during the second world war. We are not creating any military alliance with China Putin said on state television. Yes we have cooperation in the sphere of militarytechnical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent there is nothing secret. China and Russia signed a no limits partnership accord in early 2022 weeks before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Beijing has refrained from criticising Putins decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine. The Russian president named Australia New Zealand and South Korea as being in line to join a global Nato and referenced a defence agreement signed by Britain and Japan earlier this year. That is why western analysts  are talking about the west starting to build a new axis similar to the one created in the 1930s by the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy and militarist Japan Putin said. His words reflect his ongoing attempt to suggest that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that its western supporters are hellbent on menacing Russia. Ukraine which was part of the Soviet Union and was subjected to devastation at the hands of Hitlers forces has consistently rejected those parallels as spurious pretexts for a war of imperial conquest.

As 10 defeats go this was the vaguely encouraging kind for Arsenal a performance of real energy and purpose that has set up a beautifully poised second leg at the Emirates Stadium next week. And amid their disappointment Arsenal now know they can hurt Bayern Munich can pin them back and starve them of the ball can put them under pressure and create chances. The burning question of course is whether Arsenal will manage to take any of them. Twentyfive shots came and went for them here seven of them to the luckless Stina Blackstenius. But Bayern really did need to be at their resilient best in a pulsating second half twice clearing off the line as an injurydepleted Arsenal turned up the heat against a team that has conceded just four league goals all season. And so Lea Schllers towering header proved the difference between the sides here even if the Bayern coach Alexander Straus suggested that on the balance of play 11 might have been a fairer result. This perhaps was the starkest point of difference between the two sides in a tight and taut game the value of a pure penaltybox assassin as opposed to the industrious but inefficient Blackstenius. Schller has added other notes and gears to her game in recent months becoming stronger off the ball and linking play more effectively but it is between the two posts that she still does her deadliest work. She has the potential to be one of the best in the world Strauss argued afterwards. I would not change her for anybody. As for Blackstenius it was another night of manual labour without too much artistry to accompany it. She gets a tough rap from many Arsenal fans for her lack of precision in front of goal but equally the absences of Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema for large parts of the season have placed a harsh burden on her. Clearly the confidence is not quite there at the moment which is probably not that surprising when you know that your club tried to smash its transfer record to sign Alessia Russo. And for the Swedish international it was another of those nearlybutnotquite kind of performances epitomised by the secondhalf chance in which she fatally hesitated eight yards out allowing Glodis Viggosdottir to steal in and block the shot. Does she work hard and create space for others? Sure. Is she good enough to lead the line in a Champions League quarterfinal? Right now probably not. There was a healthy dose of controversy too with both of Bayerns goalline clearances. The first saw a shirtpull on Rafaelle Souza in the buildup the second a potential backpass handball in the penalty area from goalkeeper Maria Luisa Grohs. Each time the Arsenal coach Jonas Eidevall howled and fumed on the sidelines each time the Macedonian referee chose not to consult the VAR. Obviously VAR is not working in the arena tonight or someone wasnt watching the pictures Eidevall grumbled. It highlights a couple of issues. The first is that VAR is only used from the quarterfinals. I dont know if that referee has ever used VAR before. Secondly goalline technology is not compulsory. Today it was not used because Bayern chose not to pay for it. Next week Arsenal have chosen to pay for it because we think it makes a fairer competition. But for all their frustration Arsenal acquitted themselves well under the highest pressure. The Allianz Arena was an imposing sight at kickoff with its rolling waves of noise its futuristic red lighting scheme the smell of bratwurst wafting across the 20000strong crowd. Bayern shaded the first half Schller brilliantly heading home Maxi Ralls cross after being allowed a couple of early sighters. Arsenals Frida Maanum holds off Klara Bhl and Saki Kumagai in Munich. Photograph Angelika WarmuthReuters Arsenal had taken a while to settle into the game but as the second half progressed they began to impose themselves. Eidevall brought on Victoria Pelova and moved Katie McCabe to leftback in an attempt to gain supremacy of the flanks. Lia Wlti and Kim Little began to pin back Georgia Stanway and Sarah Zadrazil in midfield. Caitlin Foord who was giving Rall a real test on the left wing clipped the post with a curling shot. These ultimately were the margins. Having weathered the storm Bayern looked a little more comfortable in the final minutes and perhaps both teams seemed to recognise that 10 was a disaster for nobody. Bayerns danger on the counterattack probably makes them slight favourites against an Arsenal team that will need to force the pace in the second leg. But for the home side the celebrations at full time were suitably restrained the cautious approval of a team who had seen enough here to know that their work is by no means done.,Down but not out. As 10 defeats go this was the vaguely encouraging kind for Arsenal a performance of real energy and purpose that has set up a beautifully poised second leg at the Emirates Stadium next week. And amid their disappointment Arsenal now know they can hurt Bayern Munich can pin them back and starve them of the ball can put them under pressure and create chances. The burning question of course is whether Arsenal will manage to take any of them.,Down but not out.

A German diplomat said Lodge  the secretarygeneral of the International Seabed Authority ISA  has a duty of neutrality and has overstepped his role in resisting measures put forward by some council members that could slow down approval of the first mining proposals according to the New York Times. Furthermore in a tweet referencing the story Gina Guilln Grillo Costa Ricas representative to the seabed authority said yesterday Member states should drive the International Seabed Authority. Decisions must come from them  must not be pushed by those who have only administrative duties. Mining the seabed cannot be rushed because of the economic interests of a few. The criticism of Lodge comes at a crucial juncture as the body is expected to receive an application for commercial seabed mining later this year. The authority which is meeting in Jamaica this week is still writing regulations that would govern the process. Germany and Costa Rica are among the increasing number of countries  including France Spain Chile New Zealand and several Pacific nations  that have recently said they do not believe there is enough available data to evaluate the impact of mining on marine life. They have called for a precautionary pause or a ban on mining in the high seas. Lodge has previously suggested environmental impacts from deep sea mining are predictable and manageable. The German government sent a letter to Lodge last week expressing its concerns. In the letter Franziska Brantner Germanys minister for economic affairs and climate action said It is not the task of the secretariat to interfere in the decision making. In the past you have actively taken a stand against positions and decisionmaking proposals from individual delegations. Brantner added that the German government is seriously concerned about this approach. In a reply to Brantner the next day Lodge described those complaints as a bold and unsubstantiated allegation without facts or evidence. Lodge said his job was to make sure the authority respects the legal framework of the law of the sea. He said his opening remarks on 8 March did not refer to any specific proposal by any delegation but were fully consistent with the competencies recognised to me and that it was false to suggest he had in the past taken positions opposing proposals from delegates. This is untrue and I reject such a baseless allegation he said. He asked the German delegation to respect him and his staff and not seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Lodge made a statement to the New York Times saying that he places high importance on the preservation and protection of the marine environment and that he is working to ensure that decision making processes around economic activity in the deep seabed is based on best available scientific knowledge. The row is a measure of growing tensions over who controls the agency amid pressure from some UN nations to slow down ocean mining while others want it to go ahead. Duncan Currie an international legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition and an official observer at the 8 March meeting told the Guardian This is not just a row between diplomats. It is very significant. The executive organ is the council. It is not for the administrative body to be telling the council what decisions they should be making. The debate has heightened in recent months because the The Metals Company a Canadian mining startup has said it intends to request approval this year to start mining as soon as 2024. The small Pacific island country of Nauru is one of three states sponsoring The Metals Company along with the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republic of Kiribati. In 2021 Nauru triggered a twoyear rule that obliges the ISA to finalise and adopt regulations for commercial mining by July 2023. According to a memo sent by the Republic of Nauru if the ISA has not finalised regulations within the time frame and a mining application has been submitted then the authority should nonetheless consider and provisionally approve it allowing for extraction to go ahead. However some authority members believe the agency is under no obligation to approve an application from The Metals Company and Nauru until the regulations are complete. Diplomats were called to a virtual meeting on 8 March to discuss what to do if a mining application was indeed sent this year. As reported by the New York Times some delegates suggested revisions to the permitting process that would strengthen the councils ability to block the start of mining. However according to a copy of his prepared remarks Lodge warned delegates not to change established procedures. It would be dangerous to disturb this balance he said. We should let the system work as it is intended to do. Lodge said he did not intend to challenge any delegations proposals. But his remarks were interpreted that way by Germany Costa Rica and France the New York Times said. A spokesperson for the ISA told the Guardian The role of the secretariat is not to pass judgment on the position of member states but to facilitate negotiations and ensure that discussions are informed by the best available science and in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1994 agreement. The secretariat carries out this mission carefully deliberately and to the best of its abilities. The spokesperson added The regulations will only be approved should ISAs members reach a consensus on its content. In the meantime only exploration activities will be permitted.,Michael Lodge a British lawyer and the head of the UNaffiliated body responsible for governing mining in the high seas has been criticised by diplomats who claim he has been pushing them to accelerate the start of deepsea mining.

He announced his first South Korea squad this month at the countrys National Football Centre in Paju where buses pass moments before unloading tourists into Odusan Unification Tower to look through big binoculars into North Korea. The German will become used to the drive southeast passing Seoul World Cup Stadium in about 30 minutes and then soon after traffic permitting arriving in the middle of the capital and turning right into a secluded street and a swanky neighbourhood of trendy restaurants expensive wine bars and the headquarters of the Korean Football Association. The journey from the edge of the demilitarised zone to downtown Seoul is a short one but the two worlds are very different. Perhaps travelling regularly up and down that corridor helps explain why Klinsmanns compatriot and predecessor Uli Stielike found it hard to separate his team from the countrys unique situation. There is no peace agreement between North and South Korea so the country is on constant alert Stielike said in an interview in Germany when asked to offer advice to Klinsmann. This caution is of course reflected in the character of the people including in football. They defend quite well because they have the discipline will coordination and toughness required. On the offensive however there is a lack of creativity and risktaking. That certainly was the case when Stielike was in charge of South Korea from 201417 and while few would argue that creative attacking play is a longstanding strength of Korean football connecting that to the 75year division of the peninsula did not go down well in Seoul. After all while Korea may be alone in division they have plenty of Asian company when it comes to struggles going forward. Ultimately though it matters little whether Klinsmann buys into his compatriots theory or not he can ascribe whatever cause he wants for the problem as long as he finds a solution. Perhaps that is why Klinsmann talked up his penchant for exciting attacking football in his first press conference. Obviously my personal background was as a striker. So I always love to attack and that means Id rather win a game 43 than 10. As well as saying the right things the 58yearold also smiled more in one press conference than Stielike or Paulo Bento who finished a fouryear tenure at the World Cup managed across their respective tenures. Klinsmanns first squad is very similar to the one that Bento took to Qatar and squeezed somewhat fortuitously into the last 16 with a lastminute win over Portugal. With a threeandahalf year contract there is time for the German to get to know the KLeague and the players in action in Japan the Middle East and Europe. It starts for him against Colombia on Friday and then against Uruguay four days later. South Korea celebrate reaching the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar. Photograph Ian MacNicolGetty Images The announcement that the head coachs job had gone to Klinsmann did not get the universal acclaim the Korea Football Association who selected another German in Michael Mller to find Bentos replacement probably wanted and expected. The days when big names were automatically feted have gone. Klinsmann has a worldclass CV as a player but fans and journalists have questions about his coaching credentials. Taking Germany to the semi finals of the World Cup on home soil in 2006 something largely credited to his assistant Joachim Lw  was followed by a spell in charge of Bayern Munich that ended after nine months. Five years with the United States were up and down and then there was an illfated 76 dayspell in charge of Hertha Berlin in 201920. It is a mixed bag especially for a man who has had little more than two months coaching experience in more than six years. Much of the announcement press conference involved Mller defending the new coach. Football is not only tactics. Football is individuality. Its about teamwork how to motivate your team in special situations he said. Klinsmann was a member of the Technical Study Group of the World Cup. He is not only informed about tactics he is informed about modern devices tools and match analysis. Jrgen Klinsmann absolutely has tactical abilities. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Stielike did not get great results but was well liked in the KFA attending football and nonfootball events with enthusiasm a trait that goes down well. It remains to be seen if Klinsmann can offer the same commitment and enthusiasm. Coaches of South Korea have traditionally been judged on World Cup qualification and the KFA can be ruthless when that looks to be in jeopardy. And the policy can be deemed to have largely worked given 1982 was the last time the Taeguk Warriors failed to reach the finals. There is a growing sense however that there needs to be something more especially with their rivals Japan pulling ahead. Reaching the 2026 World Cup finals should prove straightforward for South Korea given Asias increased allocation of places from four to eight which in turn eases the pressure on Klinsmann somewhat. But that may make the more nebulous task of leaving a legacy more difficult. If Klinsmann succeeds it is not only Korea that moves to the next level but also his own coaching reputation.,After a career spent in Europe and North America Jrgen Klinsmann is now in Asia.

American activist journalist Varian Fry ran an office in a Marseille hotel in 1940 working with a ragtag band of resistance operatives US expats and the odd sympathetic diplomat to enact a grand plan help Jewish or antiNazi writers artists philosophers and other blacklisted individuals to escape persecution in Europe and emigrate to a fulfilling new life. In a coruscating riviera setting disparate people with a shared purpose band together to achieve something truly noble working in the flickering shadow of the Holocaust without the extreme violence of nazism coming close enough to force the narrative fully into the dark. It could be a great drama and Transatlantic  nearly is one. Cocreated with Daniel Hendler by Anna Winger the writer behind Deutschland 83 and Unorthodox Transatlantic doesnt match the kinetic thrills of the former or the intense characterisation of the latter. It has many competing elements but more than anything its a sunny adventure fully aware of the threatened horror that fuels it  but light enough in tone that you could almost imagine it going out on a Sunday evening on ITV. Our lead character is not Fry but one of those expats Mary Jayne Gold Gillian Jacobs. Flush with money wired over from Chicago by Daddy Gold is putting off returning home for as long as possible fearful of falling into a life of enervated posh housewifery finding cunning ways to use her wealth to help the refugees who camp on the beach at Marseille gives her life. Fry Cory Michael Smith meanwhile has a wife at home but is in love with his ERC colleague Thomas Amit Rahav  portraying Fry as gay mirrors the book the series is inspired by The Flight Portfolio by Julie Orringer. The novels take on Frys sexuality was seen as crass speculation when it was first reviewed in 2019 but less so a few weeks later when Frys son wrote to the New York Times to say Orringer was right. With Gold swiftly falling for dashing polyglot refugee Albert Hirschman Lucas Englander there is as much romance as there is daring heroism when the ERC gang hole up in a villa on the edge of town temporarily living with the likes of Max Ernst Andr Breton Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall as they try to get the illustrious fugitives on to a ship a plane or along a secret path through the Pyrenees. As a palatable history lesson Transatlantic is comprehensive. The culpability of America for the refugees plight is baldly set out Fry is driven by anger at how his attempts to report on antisemitic violence in Germany have been ignored in the States while the character of US consul Graham Patterson played by Corey Stoll as a heartless realpolitik merchant Henry Ford sold over 60000 Model Cs in Germany in the last five years! embodies how the thenneutral USA didnt let compassion compromise its selfinterest. As you might expect from the cocreator of Unorthodox the question of how some characters view their Jewishness  Hirschman is a man who rejected this part of his identity as a carefree young man before the Nazis forced him to reconsider  is intelligently handled. There are stimulating contemporary parallels too. The south of France isnt occupied by Hitlers troops but is run by the Naziadjacent Vichy collaborators who publicly complain of an illegal immigration crisis before coming up with a solution stop the boats. Transatlantic struggles however to weave its learning points elegantly into the drama to show rather than tell. Whether its the importance of the artists the political realities on the ground or the protagonists personal dilemmas what we need to know tends to arrive neatly packaged in speechy dialogue. One aspect of Golds character is that she ends up using her physical attractiveness in ways that demean her but if you didnt perceive that this often used to be the fate of female intelligence officers a supporting character is on hand to spell it out. This contributes to Transatlantics tonal problems. The daring rescue of the refugees and the two love stories within the ERCs ranks are potentially epic stories that dont feel epic taking place as they do amid peril that never feels all that perilous  because the setting shines the famous writers and artists are amusingly wacky and with the muted Jacobs slightly miscast in the lead role the rescuers are defined more by capering pluck than deathdefying courage. Some scenes with the bumbling cowards in the local police force have a faint whiff of Allo Allo! about them. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Whats On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

This is why 3 April. There is certainly far too much singleuse rubbish created and manufacturers should be incentivised to produce less. Since they are motivated to seek the cheapest option eg disposable versus returnable bottles it is up to the government to create economic rules that favour reduce reuse recycle. It should also review how disposal is funded. Costs are incurred when following the proper disposal route and these can be considerable. This provides an incentive to flytip and discourages the provision of bins the owneroperator has to pay. Litter clearing is the other side of the coin. Public bodies both local and national need to give greater priority to this  look at the state of roadsides. The money for this has to come from somewhere and in principle should be raised when items are made and sold. Where I disagree with the author is in exculpating litterers. The decision to drop litter whatever ones circumstances is a personal choice littering is not confined to those who are hardup. The common characteristic of wilful litterers rich or poor is selfishness  my convenience grievance or whatever is all that matters. However I agree that merely ranting against litter is unproductive and if one doesnt like to see it then one should get out there and help pick it up I do. More power to Taheri for doing that. Peter Janes West Harptree Somerset I read with interest Leila Taheris article about how much to blame those who litter. I help local litter volunteers and the amount of rubbish chucked out of car windows into the hedges and verges along my local lane is truly atrocious. The vast majority of the rubbish is made up of discarded glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans. When I lived in Germany I never saw this kind of litter anywhere and there was a good simple reason. Germany has had an excellent deposit return scheme DRS and recycling system for over 25 years. All supermarkets have machines that take glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans in return for a voucher that you redeem at the till. Even if somebody throws one of these items into a hedge it wouldnt be there for long because every kid knows its worth 25 cents. Environmental groups in Britain campaigned hard for two decades for something similar here but the current government dragged its feet because it is in the pocket of the big drinks companies and supermarkets. In 2019 it finally announced that a DRS would go ahead it then took two years for a consultation then another two years to hear the outcome. Now we hear that it wont be introduced until after the next election  and it wont even include glass bottles. All those who voted for the present government should admit their share of blame for the dismal state of our country. Edmund Wood Gillingham Dorset I organise our village litter pick and we are invariably disheartened by the amount of rubbish we find and do get angry about it so when I read Leila Taheris article I thought it was the Guardians April fools joke two days late. So when I see a delivery bloke chucking his can out of his van window I shouldnt think him a lazy inconsiderate slob he is just feeling alienated disconnected and excluded. Colin McRae Great Dunmow Essex Leila Taheris article was infuriating. How patronising to suggest that people shouldnt be expected to use a bin because of society. Litterers disgrace themselves and this planet and they are a very very long way down my list of people to feel sorry for. Im sure the heron that choked to death would agree.

Leon Smiths side qualified for the group stage by defeating Colombia 31 away in February. The 2015 champions will look to perform better on home soil than last September in Glasgow when defeats against the USA and the Netherlands saw Great Britain fail to reach the Final 8 knockout competition which was won by Canada. Britains top three singles players Cameron Norrie Dan Evans and Jack Draper were all called up for the Colombia tie  which was on clay at altitude with pressureless balls  alongside doubles specialists Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury. It remains to be seen whether Smith will recall Andy Murray to the squad for the Group B encounter back in Manchester or hand another chance to 21yearold Draper who recently beat the veteran Scot in the last 32 at Indian Wells. Australias challenge is likely to be led by world No 18 Alex de Minaur and Wimbledon runnerup Nick Kyrgios. France  who last won the Davis Cup in 2017 and were runnersup the following year  will have veteran Richard Gasquet as their topranked singles player. Threetime grand slam champion and 2014 Davis Cup winner Stan Wawrinka will bring his experience to the Swiss team having helped them upset Germany in the qualifiers. Elsewhere in the draw the defending champions Canada are top seeds in Group A and will play in Bologna against hosts Italy Sweden and Chile. Group C will be in Valencia where the worlds current top two Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are set to meet when Spain take on Serbia with the Czech Republic and South Korea completing the lineup. Croatia will host Group D at a venue still to be confirmed against the Netherlands USA and Finland. The winners and runnersup from each group will advance to a sixday shootout for the trophy in Mlaga during late November. Alcaraz and Rybakina target Sunshine Double Carlos Alcaraz and Elena Rybakina stayed on course to complete the Sunshine Double with both Indian Wells champions advancing at the Miami Open. Alcaraz beat Tommy Paul 64 64 to book a quarterfinal against another American player Taylor Fritz who defeated Denmarks Hlger Rune 63 64. Rybakina notched up her 12th straight win thrashing Martina Trevisan 63 60 to reach the semifinals. The Wimbledon champion will face Jessica Pegula next after the No 3 seed saved two match points in a thrilling 46 63 76 72 victory over Anastasia Potapova sealed late at night after a fourhour rain delay in Florida. In the mens draw Stefanos Tsitsipas was sent packing by Russias Karen Khachanov who won 76 74 64 in the fourth round to end a 23match winless run against a top10 opponent. Khachanov will next face Argentinas Francisco Cerndolo while Daniil Medvedev will face home hopeful Christopher Eubanks in the last eight.

I am here with one piece of very important news that everyone needs to know. Thats right Britain is horny. I hesitate to ask but how horny are we talking here? Really horny. Hornier than you could possibly imagine. Rutting. Humping. Basically just exactly what youd see in a nature documentary but with people from Basildon instead of wild animals. Please stop. I cant. Its a quantifiable fact. Lovehoney a sex toy company just did a survey of 22000 people from 15 countries across the world asking them to rate their sex drive out of 10. And guess what the results said? I dont know that Britain is horny? So horny. The fourth horniest country in the whole of Europe in fact. Our national average sex drive is 6.22 out of 10. Wait were only fourth? Which country is the most horny in Europe? Italy of course! Italy scored 6.93 Spain scored 6.91 France scored 6.24 and then its us. And which countries ranked lower than Britain? Germany scored 6.09 Switzerland scored 5.87 and Austria scored 5.56. Why do you ask? Oh no reason. Its not like Im going to immediately apply for residency there or anything. Listen dont be such a prude. This survey is great news. It is? Yes! You know how theres a trend of young people not having much sex any more maybe because Covid disrupted the shaping of their attitudes or maybe because theyre too distracted by other devices or maybe because of slow generational change? Yes. Well not here baby. Britain is almost singlehandedly bucking the trend. While globally there seems to be a downturn in sex drive among Gen Z in this country theyre hornier than anyone else. Their sex drive according to the survey is a whopping 6.96. My God. I know. It means that young British people are hornier than the average Italian person. This is unprecedented. Did the survey teach us anything else? It did. It taught us that over65s have a subAustrian sex drive of 5.16 and that men are on average 12 hornier than women. You know none of this seems particularly British. Well I could tell you about another recent survey by Durex that revealed men orgasm four times as often as women and that 11 of women were disappointed about this but had got used to it. There we go. Repressed misery. This is the Britain I love. You have a real problem you know. Do say British people are all very horny. Dont say Even your mum and dad.,Name Horny Britain.

Only governments can guarantee these rights. Adopting a cash first approach to food insecurity is vital to ensure people can access income before charity but equally vital is the prioritisation of systemic changes to truly tackle poverty and inequality. It comes after the UKs leading poverty charities said the basic benefits given to lowincome households are at least 140 a month below the real cost of food energy and everyday basics. Research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the food bank network the Trussell Trust said inadequate benefits were the main driver of the big rise in destitution. They urged the government to formally bring universal credit rates into line with minimum living costs. There have been plans from international organisations to expand the model into new countries. However the letter to the Observer states While the expansion of organised surplus food redistribution might seem like a winwin solution this practice fails to reduce food waste levels while undermining policies designed to address food insecurity.,A growing reliance on food banks across the world risks discouraging proper state policies to deal with poverty according to a joint warning issued by academics and charities.

Until then referendums had always been about the future. But the moment arrived when the horizon closed and we started to only look back towards the past. A referendum on the past would involve choosing to return to the happiest decade or year from the 20th century in each nations history. A deficit of future always unlocks huge reserves of nostalgia for the past which decade would nations choose? Germany picks the very end of the 80s a perpetuum mobile of 1989 in which the wall is constantly falling. Italy goes back to the 60s. Its as if the map of Europe shifts from territorial to temporal and nations close themselves up  for a very short while  inside their own happy past. We are seeing this model  this strong pull backwards  being played out now. In short time has replaced space. The world has been parcelled out more or less explored and familiar. We are left with an immense ocean of time which is really an ocean of the past. The very idea of nostalgia has changed. No longer focused on a place or home nostos as the etymology of the word suggests nostalgia now is for a different time. Perhaps we should use some other term  chronostalgia for example. And in this sense our wars have become wars for the past. When the novel came out at one reading the audience asked me OK but what would Russia choose? At the time I wasnt sure. I would like to think it would be the Gorbachev years the time of perestroika. The answer came on 24 February last year. In this invisible referendum on the past Russia chose the years of the second world war the last time they enjoyed the recognition of a world prepared to forget Stalin the gulags the Holodomor and the cruelties of the Soviet system. Putin has chosen understandably to return to the early 1940s. Russias current unhappiness and isolation have made it turn back towards the happy and powerful times of the Soviet Union. In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany did What Putin wants is not to win this war but to make it chronic to force us all to live in that regime. His goal is to bombard and raze the present and the future with all its infrastructure and everydayness  so that there is no water no warmth no light. To destroy everyday life and from there existence as well to literally annihilate the Ukrainian nation. An aggressive project to revive the past especially an unprocessed forgotten or rewritten past is the perfect breeding ground for populism and nationalism. We saw this under Trump and now it is coming true in an even more sinister guise under Putin. Memory and culture are part of Europes immune system. It must recognise and disarm the viruses of collective blindness loss of reason nationalistic madness and the birth of new dictators. But the Ukraine war has broken out as those who carry the living memory of the second world war are no longer with us. We are on that generational precipice when the last of the participants who kept that memory alive the last concentration camp prisoners the last soldiers are passing away. I hope we are not heading towards some strange collective Alzheimers. Because when the flame of memory goes out the beasts of the past close the circle around us. The less memory the more past. We remember so as to hold the past at bay  in the past. It is no longer a question merely of memory but of what we remember and how. Because Putin too swears by memory. Populism and nationalism also create their own version of memory. In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany for example did the painful work that penetrates all layers of society enters into institutions schools and history textbooks. Its absence keeps alive Russias status as the great victim an alibi for new sacrifices it feels it deserves. One of the most disturbing things now is the erasure of the boundary between truth and fakeness. This fakeness not only rewrites the past but predetermines the future. It grounds itself in a revised past precisely to justify current aggressions and infamies. Throughout my entire childhood and youth in Bulgaria I was taught in school that Russia was our big brother whom we could not do without like all older brothers he could beat up the bad kids in the neighbourhood who bullied us. Of course my generation secretly dreamed of other nations of those yearned for foreign lands to the west of us. And this is some small justice  the USSR never became a dream destination despite the propaganda instead it remained a place we held in awe. And this has consequences for the current situation. Ukrainian protesters seen setting up symbolic grave crosses with the inscription Russian occupier in Kyiv during February. Photograph Sergei ChuzavkovSopa ImagesRexShutterstock In Bulgaria today proRussian propaganda works easily on various levels. From feelings of gratitude to our twotime liberators and as it turns out our twotime enslavers through veneration for Russian culture as if Putin and Chekhov were twin brothers to statements by highranking politicians who refuse to unambiguously take the side of the victim. A Eurobarometer poll from May of last year indicates that public opinion in Bulgaria is closer than that of other EU countries to the Russian position on the war. Bulgaria is also in last place in the EU for media literacy. Facebook remains the most influential social media in Bulgaria more than 95 of our traffic is there. The problem is that propaganda from the internet has penetrated official and serious media as well. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans  from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

I dont think the country has seen such disintegration and polarisation  made worse by social networks and public figures  in decades. It may sound too harsh but sometimes I get the feeling that we are on the verge of a quiet civil war. This part of Europe has not been on the crest of the wave of history since 1989. But it has never ceased through its literatureand stories to offer warnings about what has already happened and could happen again. It seems to me that these stories have not been heard well enough. Here we can clearly sense that history is not yet finished. Now we know and can formulate it as long as there is a single bleeding wound of history on the continent the entire continent bleeds. No one no matter how many kilometres to the west they may be can rest easy. The centre of Europe is not something static stuck in Berlin or Paris. The centre of Europe is that mobile point of pain. Where it hurts and bleeds. Today it is in the east in proud Ukraine. In one of the most beautiful essays about Europe A Kidnapped West written during the cold war 1983 Milan Kundera begins with a final desperate telex message sent by the director of the Hungarian news agency in 1956 while the building itself was under artillery fire. His message read We are going to die for Hungary and for Europe. In those critical minutes he wanted to communicate something. The Russian armys invasion of Hungary was an invasion of Europe dont wait react. Did Europe or the west back then receive and decipher the message? This time we know for whom the bell tolls. People in Europe understood immediately. Kunderas essay ends with the bitter conclusion that after the second world war the west turned away from central Europe and simply thought of it as a satellite of the Soviet empire without its own identity. This inertia I dare say continued even after 1989. The war in Ukraine has actually returned central and eastern Europe to Europe. From the periphery there is a hypersensitivity to what is impending an ability to pick up the scent of alarm in the air. Eastern Europe has learned to sense danger with its skin. For this reason I will allow myself to put it this way dont underestimate the books essays and poems from this corner of Europe. Decode the symbols in them. Words dont stop tanks and dont down drones. But they can cant they? stop delay or at least cause those in the tanks who make war on innocent people hesitate at least for a bit. Words can help those who are deluded by fake news and propaganda. This war will not end with the last bullet fired. It began years before the first shot and is likely to end years after the final one. But literature has a role at the very least it can teach us resistance and empathy it can offer us the tools with which to identify propaganda lies it can preserve personal stories from the epicentre of pain generate memory that will not be violated and if possible console. No propaganda should be stronger than the memory of a little boy fleeing from war with a telephone number scrawled on his arm.,Four years ago I wrote a novel in which the feeling that there was a deficit of future was so acute that every nation in Europe wanted to hold its own referendum on the past.

It was a job to which he had seemed destined since becoming the youngest coach in Bundesliga history in 2016 taking charge of Hoffenheim at the age of 29. He had already led Hoffenheims under19s to the Bundesliga youth title. He seemed preternaturally gifted and in Germany the gifted always end up at Bayern especially when they come from Bavaria. Taking over with Hoffenheim seven points adrift Nagelsmann inspired them to unlikely survival and the following season took them into the Champions League. After a thirdplace finish in 2017 18 Nagelsmanns upward journey continued at RB Leipzig as he took them to the Champions League semifinals. A Bundesliga title in his first season at Bayern may have been expected but his first silverware was no less welcome for that. And yet and yet  Leipzigs 30 defeat by Thomas Tuchels Paris SaintGermain in that onelegged Champions League semifinal in 2020 was damaging. They were flat from start to finish devoid of the aggression shown against Atltico Madrid and Tottenham in the previous rounds. PSG have habitually been rattled by hardpressing opponents and their starry but lackadaisical forward line means they can be overwhelmed in midfield. Leipzig though were so timorous that the extraordinary trousers sported by Nagelsmann that night came to seem compensatory. Its one game. Failures can happen particularly when a team are playing on a stage they have never previously reached. But it fitted a pattern Nagelsmann faltering in big games against non German opposition. It began when Hoffenheim were drawn against Liverpool in a Champions League playoff in 201718. A potentially awkward tie for Liverpool was won more comfortably than a 63 aggregate suggests. Leipzig didnt put up much of a challenge against them in the last 16 in 202021 either. It is true Leipzig were underdogs in all those games but the issue is less the defeats than the tame manner of them. Then last season Bayern were eliminated by Villarreal in the Champions League quarterfinals. Obviously if you focus only on a managers defeats he looks bad. And the sample size is small. But this is the nature of modern German football particularly for a Bayern coach when the title is all but assured. Europe is the only stage where honour can be won and Nagelsmann is yet to do that. That said Bayern have won eight out of eight in the Champions League this season eliminating PSG but even in the first leg of the last 16 there was a sense of opportunity lost. A manager more in tune with the emotional flow of the game might have seized on PSGs dismal first half would have recognised their midfield domination and grasped the moment rather than diligently retaining possession. As it was Bayern survived a late wobble after Kylian Mbapp had come on and although they ended up going through comfortably that lack of ruthlessness needlessly offered PSG a route back into the game. Julian Nagelsmanns Bayern Munich eliminated PSG from the Champions League but they lacked ruthlessness. Photograph Stefan MatzkesampicsCorbisGetty Images There is something preposterous about this. There is an absurdity to a manager being sacked having lost three of 36 games this season. But that is the reality of modern German football. Bayerns annual revenues are 83 higher than those of their nearest rivals and in that sense Nagelsmann is just as much a victim of Germanys financial divisions as Hansa Rostock or Arminia Bielefeld. Winning isnt enough there must be domination and there must be panache. After the World Cup said Bayerns chief executive Oliver Kahn we have played less successfully and less attractively. Its not just performances that led to Nagelsmanns dismissal or even the defeats by Borussia Mnchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen that led to Bayern surrendering top spot. As doubts mounted he seemed less and less able to deal with the pressure. His hunt for the mole he claimed was leaking dressingroom information which led to the sacking of Bayerns popular longterm goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic came to seem paranoid. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

And so Nagelsmann thrust into coaching at the age of 20 by injury tipped for the top from an early age has lost his dream job. When Johan Cruyff having already managed Ajax was sacked by Barcelona in 1996 he declared time on his managerial career at the age 49 Nagelsmann is 35. Cruyff remained in Barcelona writing his newspaper columns the unofficial conscience of the club. But he had won four league titles  at a time when every championship really mattered for Barcelona  led them to their first European Cup and changed the parameters of how the world believed football could be played. Nagelsmann for all his promise has no such achievements. He will surely coach again. But where and with what enthusiasm? He has been linked with Real Madrid and Tottenham. But how would Nagelsmann who quite aside from his occasionally extravagant fashion choices has turned up to Bayern training on a skateboard and a HarleyDavidson motorcycle as though suffering a perpetual and premature midlife crisis fit within Madrids culture of seorio? How would club grandees react to his loud tracksuits and brash checks? Equally were he to turn up at Tottenham it would compared with Bayern and Madrid feel like a step down. Spurs have suffered enough with managers who have treated the job as though they were doing the club a favour. What they need is the equivalent of Mauricio Pochettino in 2014 a hungry manager on the way up not one no matter how young fighting for relevance perhaps eyeing ultimately a cathartic return to Bayern. That is Nagelsmanns great problem. At an age when many are still playing he has reached a crisis point in his managerial career. It may be his best years are already behind him. This is often the tragedy of wunderkinder gilded youth yields often to leaden middle age.,If only Julian Nagelsmann had never become manager of Bayern Munich the world might have believed he would be a very good manager of Bayern Munich.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/long-arm-of-the-law-trump-putin-lawrence-douglas,Is the long arm of the law finally catching up to Trump and Putin  Lawrence Douglas,These two men find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flaunt with impunityLets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict  4943 chars,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict Donald Trump. Admittedly the two cases are quite different. Putin is wanted for his role in orchestrating devastating war crimes. Trump stands accused of relatively minor crimes involving the payment of hush money to a former porn star. But there is a sense that these two men so recently bound in mutual admiration of their bullying contempt for democratic norms and legal process now find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flout with impunity. Of course there is no guarantee that either man will ever be fully held to account. Those looking forward to the day of Putins reckoning before the ICC in The Hague should bear in mind that the only reason the allies succeeded in trying members of the Nazi leadership in Nuremberg was because Hitlers Germany lay in ruins. Putin remains very much in power and presides over an arsenal of 6000 nuclear warheads that he continues to recklessly brandish. Unless Putin finds himself ousted from power his arrest warrant will remain a symbolic reminder that in the eyes of international law the Russian leader is a pariah and a fugitive. Trump and Putin are both now legally if not politically cornered No such evasions will be possible for Trump. And yet the very legal system that Trump defames as hopelessly corrupt demands that an indictment have a coherent legal basis and that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is possible then that a court could dismiss the New York charges or should the case go forward the trial result in an acquittal. Which is why I believe those interested in seeing Trump brought to justice should look past this indictment  based on an untested legal theory and involving a constellation of tawdry wrongdoings  and train their attention on Fulton county Georgia where Trump faces likely indictment for soliciting election fraud. Or else look to the Department of Justice which continues to investigate Trump for his actions culminating in the January 6 insurrection and for his refusal to hand over classified documents illegally stored at his MaraLago residence. These investigations particularly in Georgia and over January 6 involve far weightier allegations of criminal wrongdoing allegations less vulnerable to attack as simply an exercise in political scoresettling. Not that Trump and his minions wont malign any attempt to hold the former president and active candidate to account as the greatest witchhunt in human history. Commenting on the indictment Tucker Carlson apocalyptically told his viewers Probably not the best time to give up your AR15. Perhaps not coincidentally his words echoed those of Margarita Simonyan the head of RT channel who responded to the ICCs warrant with the observation Id like to see the country that arrests Putin  eight minutes later. Or whatever the flight time to its capital is  presumably referring to the time it would take a Russian nuclear warhead to reduce the targeted city to smoldering cinders. Trump and Putin are both now legally if not politically cornered. If they first were joined by their adherence to a politics of ethnonationalist authoritarianism now what they have in common is their pursuit of a denuded politics of destruction. With Putins dreams of military triumph and a restoration of Russian imperial glory dashed in the early hours of the invasion the Russian leader now appears without strategy and goals except to make Ukraine pay for his misbegotten aggression with death and ruination. If Trump were a man of restraint he would not find himself in the legal peril he now faces As for Trump even some of his sycophants in Fox News had begun to ruefully observe that since declaring his candidacy the former president has offered no political vision or plan except to present himself as the sum of all political grievance and as the avenging sword of his militant supporters as they wage the final battle against the fanciful forces aligned against them. Putin has clearly demonstrated his taste for violence. Trump has done so on one fateful occasion. When first anticipating indictment Trump cajoled his supporters to PROTEST and to TAKE OUR NATION BACK!  words that recalled his incitements on 6 January 2021. He has not since repeated that demand. But as the wheels of justice turn it is hard to imagine Trump continuing to exercise anything that resembles restraint. It is not in his DNA to do so. If Trump were a man of restraint  respectful of norms decency and the rule of law  he would not find himself in the legal peril he now faces. And so we can only hope that our nation and its justice system can absorb the barrage of attacks most likely to come.,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict Donald Trump.

But when he joined the industry in the 1990s it was in the middle of a wave of change. Readily available car finance suddenly meant the public could buy more expensive cars. It changed the type of car people bought says Brownridge chief executive of BMW Group UK. Drivers could borrow to buy a pricier vehicle in the expectation that it would hold its value and could be sold on later. Britons couldnt get enough of it low interest rates helped and BMW rose to become the UKs fourthbiggest seller of cars despite the premium price tag of most of its models. And now the industry is facing an even bigger paradigm shift with the transition to electric cars in full swing and newer innovations such as connected and autonomous cars opening the door to different kinds of business. Things have changed a lot and are about to change significantly again says Brownridge standing in BMWs flagship showroom on Londons Park Lane. I genuinely think we are on the edge of probably the most exciting time in the industry. Brownridge is a UK car industry lifer. He was born in Oxford  close to the Mini factory which BMW now owns  but when he was small his family moved to Hong Kong so his engineer father could work on the citys mass transit system. Ive very fond memories of a very different culture Brownridge says. It was a very different world with the UK ruling the city state until the handover in 1997. When Chris Patten last governor of Hong Kong left on the royal yacht Britannia with the then Prince Charles it was quite a sad moment really. However his family was always tied to the UK and he returned for his secondary education. After university the car industry was the obvious choice. I am fascinated by anything with wheels he says. It felt very natural to start work with Land Rover then under the Rover Group which was in turn owned by BMW. He worked in managing customer relationships and data at Mini Rover and MG. Brownridge rose through the BMW ranks via marketing roles overseeing sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympics theres a replica Olympic torch in the corner of the room before taking charge of the Mini brand. He became UK chief executive in 2021 overseeing BMWs fourthlargest market after China the US and Germany. BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Traditionally carmakers would sell cars to dealers and the dealers handled customer relationships but now manufacturers increasingly sell direct to consumers online. Dealers are highly sensitive about suggestions of a changing business model  under which carmakers take more control of the customer relationship  and Brownridge is wary of giving details of what BMW is considering. Our longterm strategy is to work with our network of retailers he says emphasising the with. However he acknowledges that how we transact is being examined. Thats something we need to work on with our partners rather than inflict on them he says. Because ultimately our success is mutual. Being more involved in the customer relationship will give carmakers more opportunities to make money throughout a vehicles life. Carmakers say they will also make their products more attractive. Customers are not always happy about being asked to pay more after purchase however. BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats. Brownridge says some of the coverage that focused on the hardware aspect was overlooking the obvious opportunity for software upgrades that can improve drivers experience. But the most eyecatching change to the car industry is the shift to electric technology. BMW made one in every 10 batterypowered cars sold in the UK in 2022 and a fifth of its UK sales were battery electric  already putting it on track to meet the governments mandate of 22 battery sales by 2024 which was confirmed last week after this interview took place. Carmakers will need to be selling 80 battery vehicles by 2030 and 100 by 2035. The government needs to ensure there is enough green energy to power electric cars and put more investment into the UKs charging network BMW has not always been on board with the UK governments plans. In 2020 it and other carmakers argued that a ban on internal combustion engines before 2040 would damage the British industry. Asked about that stance Brownridge says the UK governments plans are ambitious  not usually a compliment from executives  but achievable for BMW at least amid very strong demand for electric cars. Were ready he says. We have the products. So we are able to respond. However he adds that the government needs to ensure there is enough green energy available to power electric cars and must put more investment into the UKs charging network. Brownridge says car buyers focus on sustainability will only increase and will soon extend beyond the fuel powering their cars to how the cars are made. A focus on greener materials might give premium carmakers an edge as their higher margins can soak up new costs. But the BMW boss cites a company visit to a coalmine west of Cologne in Germany as evidence for why green manufacturing will become increasingly important to carmakers. The giant Hambach coalmine is bigger than central London in area and Brownridge says a giant machine there scoops out enough coal every day to cover a football field to a height of almost 100 metres. You look at that and think well this cant continue because therell be nothing left he says. Customer choice will be heavily influenced by their understanding of the same sustainability for the products. I think thats quite exciting.

The use of egg as a binding medium for pigments a form of paint known as egg tempera has a long history turning up in works including the mural paintings of the Palace of Nestor in Pylos dating to 1200BC. But in the 15th century there was a shift in European paintings towards using oil as a binder instead  an approach favoured by early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck. Despite the shift egg has been found in the works of Old Master artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci  with the formers Lamentation over the Dead Christ among those featuring the use of egg within oil paint. Now scientists say they have new insights into why such artists might have added the ingredient to their oil paints. The egg is used for modification and finetuning of paint properties said Dr Patrick Dietemann of the Doerner Institut in Germany. Writing in the journal Nature Communications Doerner and colleagues report how they explored the issue by creating three types of paint. The first was made from pigment ground with linseed oil the second used the same mixture but with the addition of a few drops of egg yolk and the third was created by mixing a pigment with a solution of diluted egg yolk  after drying this was ground and dispersed with oil. The results reveal how yolk can influence the stiffness of the paint depending upon how it is added and the pigment used. By changing preparation technique you can change the properties of the paint. Thus two paints with the same composition can have different microstructures and this will result in different properties said Dr Ilaria Bonaduce an author of the study from the University of Pisa. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

In addition the stiffness of the lower layers of paint prevents the paint surface from cracking or wrinkling during drying said Prof Norbert Willenbacher an author of the study from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The team also discovered humidity had less of an influence on the properties of lead white paint when the paint was made by drying the pigment with egg yolk before grinding and adding oil. The yolk protects the paints from undesirable changes caused by absorption of moisture from the environment because the water is captured in the protein layer surrounding the pigments Willenbacher said. The study also reveals egg yolk generally increased the drying time of paints a feature the researchers attributed to its antioxidant properties which also help to protect the paints from degrading over time. While the team said it was not possible to exclude unintentional additions of egg to the oil paints Bonaduce said it was likely the Old Master artists were well aware of the benefits of the ingredient. I am quite convinced that they did not know the chemical and physical explanations of what they were doing but they knew very well what they were doing.,It pays to go to work on an egg when painting with oils researchers have found as the addition of yolk can prevent wrinkling yellowing and problems with humidity.

A number of teams in the Womens Super League have swapped white shorts for darker colours in response to discussion with players about how wearing white shorts makes them feel while on their periods including Hemps club Manchester City who switched to burgundy shorts. For us at City to move away from that helped other teams to move away from it Hemp said. You dont just want your own team but everyone in the environment to feel safe and comfortable. Its great to have that and be able to start something where things have changed. You feel as players you are being listened to and you are safe and comfortable. West Hams Parker said Anything that relieves the mental stress from a player is a good thing. If its one less thing to worry about then why not? Hemp who started in the European Championship final last summer in front of a soldout Wembley crowd of 87192 said she is looking forward to the next few years with England despite Uefa announcing that Switzerland  where the largest stadium has a 38512 capacity  will host Euro 2025. It will always be hard to top a home Euros in front of a packedout Wembley stadium  obviously winning it as well  against Germany Hemp said. Looking forward to the future it might hold 38000 but theres still going to be so many fans that will be there.
