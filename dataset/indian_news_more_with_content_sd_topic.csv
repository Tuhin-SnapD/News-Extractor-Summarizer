https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/02/how-michael-vaughan-left-most-cricket-fans-pining-for-his-england-days,How Michael Vaughan left most cricket fans pining for his England days  Andy Bull,Since the triumphs of his playing career the Asheswinning captain has struggled to find a meaningful niche in cricketI keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk ,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot o 5980 chars,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot on one of those disposable plastic cameras but you can still pick out the players making their way around the boundary Theres Andrew Flintoff one arm above his head Marcus Trescothick holding the little crystal replica of the urn Steve Harmison one hand throttling a bottle of champagne and Michael Vaughan dapper despite his tired whites He has an England flag knotted around his neck It hangs down his back like a cape It was taken at about a quartertoseven in the evening on 12 September half an hour or so after the umpires had called off play on the final day of one of the greatest Test series when England had beaten one of the best teams to play the game to win back the Ashes after 16 years They say cricket doesnt build character but reveals it But you wonder how many of the millions who watched that series really had anything like a clear idea of the personalities of the men playing in it Fans are romantics after all and make heroes of their favourite players In the years afterwards we would get to know a little more about them all Trescothick and Flintoff who had seemed to be such easy and convivial people opened up about their struggles with mental illness We had Vaughan all wrong too There were no great revelations rather a gradual unfolding of himself in his television and radio work and on social media Still over time the gap between the Vaughan we saw in 2005 and the one we have come to know in the years since came to seem an awful lot wider than the 100odd yards between the grandstand seats and the pitch where we watched him go about his batting For an 18month stretch in the early 2000s he did that as well in Test cricket as any Englishman ever has 100 197 195 against India at home 177 145 183 against Australia away and altogether more runs than anyone but Viv Richards had ever made in a single year All in matinee idol style with a high elbow a handsome drive and a withering pull The captaincy took the edge off his form but England gained something better anyway As a young man at Yorkshire Vaughan studied the senior players around him Martyn Moxon David Byas Darren Lehmann

Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply after newsletter promotion As Englands captain he seemed again to combine the best qualities from people who had done it before him From this side of the boundary he appeared to have a fertile mind a feel for people a keen sense of when and whether to take risks a bullish selfconfidence and when he needed it a steady bat If you could have frozen his life in that moment in the late summer of 2005 he would be remembered now only as one of Englands very best captains His winning percentage a lick under 51 is second only to Mike Brearleys among people who did the job often Perhaps Vaughans great strength was that he was such a good blusterer he managed to convince what was in reality an utterly outmatched England team that they were capable of beating an Australia side including in Shane Warne Glenn McGrath Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist a good handful of the truly great players Michael Vaughan waves to the crowd after beating Australia in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge in 2005 Photograph Gareth CopleyPA There were signs of what was behind the bluff during his retirement years which were oddly needy There was a tearful press conference when he stepped down as captain and an awkward 11month stretch when he insisted he still wanted to play on that ended in a row with Yorkshires former chief executive in a car park outside Headingley after the club refused to indulge him in a farewell run of games for their oneday team It was followed by a string of embarrassing commercial deals including a stretch when he was busy flogging artworks he had made by flinging cricket balls at a canvas It felt as if Vaughans ego had convinced him that having achieved as much as he did in the sport his life after it owed him more than he had received He inevitably drifted into punditry where he could be brilliantly insightful when he was talking about the sport and an awful bore when he wasnt Other England captains from his era shaped second careers as writers analysts and administrators Vaughan apparently lost for anything better to do tried to make his way as a media personality He seemed to think the trick of it was in being witty which he isnt and offering provocative takes on hot topics He is you guess one of the few people left using the word banter without irony His most egregious tweets came up all over again during these Cricket Discipline Commission hearings which cleared him on Friday of using racist andor discriminatory language and bringing the game into disrepute Vaughan now says the words were disgusting and awful and other words you could use It wasnt clear if he was thinking of the one that feels most appropriate for them stupid Vaughans act wore thin long before he finally seemed to realise that the only reaction it provoked in most cricket fans was to make them pine for that time back in 2005 But even here theres a sense that our idea of him isnt quite right that hes still playing games Hes just not as good at them as he used to be at the one that made him famous to begin with Ask his friends and he has plenty in and out of the game and they will tell you about a thoughtful talented and affectionate man full of bright ideas You can only hope he decides to show it to the rest of us,All photographs subject to copyright.,business

spam fraud and abuseliliMeasure audience engagement and site statistics to unde 1131 chars,When Donald Trump enters a New York courtroom on Tuesday hell face a seasoned judge who is no stranger to the former presidents orbit Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan has sentenced Trumps close confident Allen Weisselberg to prison presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and overseen former adviser Steve Bannons criminal fraud case But Trumps historic arraignment on Tuesday will perhaps be Merchans most highprofile case to date even after a long career atop the statelevel trial court Merchan has been described by observers as a tough judge yet one who is fair no matter who is before him Heres what you need to know A MAN OF HIS WORD Trumps arraignment is likely to be a spectacle with a show of law enforcement and with the former president already fanning the flames on social media with his views on Merchan and his indictment But in the courthouse Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays attorneys who have appeared before him told CNN and hes known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention Judge Merchan was efficient practical and listened carefully to what I had to say Nicholas Gravante the attorney who represented Weisselberg in his plea said via email He was clear in signaling his judicial inclinations which helped me tremendously in giving Mr Weisselberg informed legal advice Judge Merchan was always wellprepared accessible and  most importantly in the Weisselberg matter  a man of his word He treated me and my colleagues with the utmost respect both in open court and behind closed doors Karen Friedman Agnifilo a private practice attorney who previously worked as the chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office supervising cases Merchan presided over echoed that sentiment Merchan doesnt let the prosecutors or the defendants create any issues in his courtroom He doesnt let a media circus or any other kind of circus happen I dont think Donald Trump attacking him and threatening him is going to bode very well for him in the courtroom Agnifilo said The judge is the kind of judge where he will ignore it and not hold it against Donald Trump Hes not vindictive in any way like that TOUGH BUT COMPASSIONATE Merchan showed some of his tough side when Weisselberg was sentenced telling the former Trump associate that if he had not already promised him a fivemonth sentence he would have handed him a much greater sentence after having listened to evidence at trial When he presided over Bannons criminal fraud case Merchan chastised the former Trump aides new team of attorneys for delaying the case when they asked for more time to review new evidence In addition to the Trump cases Merchan has also presided over other highprofile cases including the soccer mom madam trial in which he set a 2 million bond for suburban mom Anna Gristina who was charged with running a 2000anhour escort service for the wealthy Bloomberg News reported Merchan also handed a 25yearstolife sentence to a Senegalese man who raped and murdered his girlfriend Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview Friday on CNN that Merchan was not easy on him when he tried a case before him but echoed that the judge likely will be fair Ive tried a case in front of him before He could be tough I dont think its necessarily going to be something thats going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case Parlatore said Merchan however is also credited by his peers for having helped create the Manhattan Mental Health Court which he often presides over and where he has earned a reputation for compassionate rulings that give defendants second chances I watched a colleague of mine try a shooting case where someone got shot so hes able to try those very serious violent crimes and then switch said Brendan Tracy a criminal defense attorney who previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office Maybe someone who was a serial shoplifter and then charged with grand larceny and is in mental health treatment court because they had mental health issues he was able to handle the wide range of cases and do them all fairly Tracy added Still Earl Ward a trial attorney and chair of public defender nonprofit The Bronx Defenders said that having watched Merchan preside over cases in the Mental Health Court the judge often sided with prosecutors Hes fair and his rulings are consistent with the law but if its a close call his reputation is that he lands on the prosecutions side Ward said EARLY CAREER Merchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office Several years later he moved on to the state attorney generals office where he worked on cases in Long

Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan the State Department said Sunday In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan whom the statement said was wrongfully detained US officials said they were considering a similar determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time Should that happen his case would be largely transferred to the office of the US Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Joe Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was Let him go The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editorinchief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation US consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Rep Mike Turner chairman of the House

no international norms that they are following Turner ROhio told CNNs State of the Union In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the chance of progress in US efforts to free its detained citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized On Saturday night Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a

finance yet it is severely underresearched This paper compiles the first anatomy of the Cayman offshore financial center OFC utilizin,Small place big money was the apt title of one of the first analyses concerning the position of the Cayman Islands in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 Twenty years later t 62883 chars,The Cayman Islands is a key node in contemporary global finance yet it is severely underresearched This paper compiles the first anatomy of the Cayman offshore financial center OFC utilizing all sources of publicly available data about the three main segments banking direct investment and portfolio investment The analysis is performed both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different segments This dissection of the Cayman OFC shows that the United States is the largest counterparty in all segments with Japan playing an important role too In fact when excluding longterm Treasuries Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world Hedge funds are the main factor for this strong CaymanUS link About 60 of global hedge fund assets are legally domiciled in Cayman  an extraordinary spatial concentration in such a tiny jurisdiction A novel contribution to the analysis of the Cayman OFC is the introduction of the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach This approach provides one plausible explanation for the unparalleled rise of the Cayman OFC by seeing this jurisdiction as one node in an AngloAmerican triangle together with the USA and the UK Caymans sovereign power INTRODUCTION Small place big money was the apt title of one of the first analyses concerning the position of the Cayman Islands in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 Twenty years later the archipelago south of Cuba is of course still small in geographic terms The amount of foreign capital booked in the Cayman offshore financial center OFC however has become bigger in this period of time  much bigger Significantly improved availability of data concerning OFCs and their counterpart countries during the last two decades allows for a better understanding of the role that the Cayman Islands plays in international finance This tiny group of islands in the Caribbean with roughly 58000 inhabitants and a domestic economy of less than US3 billion has attracted foreign capital of over US4100 billion if we take into account banking assets direct investment and portfolio investment note that the total stock of external assets is likely much higher because there are no data available for trusts see Harrington Citation2016 Setting the amount of foreign assets in relation to the GDP of a particular jurisdiction results in a specific offshoreintensity ratio Fichtner Citation2015 According to this ratio the Cayman Islands is by far the most intensive OFC in the world with foreign assets amounting to over 1500 times Caymans domestic economy Moreover the Cayman Islands is not only large in relative terms but also in absolute ones the small Caribbean archipelago has attracted more external assets than advanced industrial countries such as Japan Canada or Italy despite them having economies several hundred times Caymans GDP Consequently Cayman is not just any random small island OFC it is one of the largest financial centers in the world and a central node in contemporary global finance However this unique OFC is severely underresearched As the legal domicile of choice for the global hedge fund industry Clarkson et al Citation2014 and as the second largest jurisdiction in the world regarding the issuance of assetbacked securities ABS from 1983 to 2008 Cetorelli and Peristani Citation2012 the Cayman Islands has played a key role for financial innovation in recent decades From 2004 to 2007 Cayman had even been the largest jurisdiction concerning the issuance of collateralized debt obligations CDOs according to Culp and Forrester Citation2010 Hedge funds as well as opaque CDOs have contributed to the development of the global financial crisis and thus such financial innovation has serious consequences for international financial stability Lysandrou Citation2012 Lysandrou and Nesvetailova Citation2015 Wjcik Citation2013a Citation2013b Utilizing all sources of publicly available data this paper compiles the first anatomy of the pivotal Cayman OFC The aim is to perform a finegrained analysis of the three main segments of crossborder finance 1 banking 2 direct investment and 3 portfolio investment This indepth case study of the Cayman Islands OFC is highly complementary to recent studies in Economic Geography eg on the role of advanced business services for offshore finance Wjcik Citation2013a on offshore jurisdictions and foreign direct investment FDI Haberly and Wjcik Citation2015a Citation2015b and finally on the political geography of offshore banking Haberly and Wjcik Citation2014 In order to further our understanding of the extremely successful development of the Cayman OFC this paper introduces the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach from international relations IRs and International Political Economy IPE to the analysis of the Cayman OFC Furthermore I analyze the important role of Japan which has escaped virtually all existing studies about the Cayman Islands The remainder of this paper is organized in six sections In the first section I briefly discuss the existing research about the Cayman Islands The second section analyzes the development of the oldest segment of the Cayman OFC  banking The following two sections are dedicated to the large domain of investment Specifically in the third section I scrutinize the comparatively small but growing segment of direct investment before analyzing the major segment of portfolio investment including the crucial hedge fund sector in the fourth section The fifth section introduces the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach to the research on the Cayman OFC Finally the sixth section concludes by discussing avenues of future research as well as some policy implications RESEARCH ABOUT THE CAYMAN OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTER Despite the importance of the Cayman Islands OFC the literature is still surprisingly scant Scholars from Economic Geography have arguably contributed the most to advancing our understanding of the Cayman Islands and its role in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 237 conclusion that the Caymans have created the image of a respectable upmarket OFC and strategically positioned themselves at the nexus of the circuits of fast and fungible financial capital is still valid today Furthermore Roberts Citation1995 argues that the status as a dependent territory of the UK is of central importance for the success of the Cayman Islands as an OFC because this status guarantees political stability She identifies a series of 1960s laws designed to attract foreign capital as a cornerstone for the development of the Cayman OFC Rapid growth began in the 1970s after the end of the Bretton Woods system and the concomitant transition to free exchange rates which included the abolition of capital controls by most Western countries According to Roberts Citation1995 the number of foreign banks active in the Cayman Islands grew at an annual average rate of 23 between 1972 and 1982 This is primarily due to the rapid development of the Euromarkets in the City of London Palan Citation1998 Burn Citation1999 which subsequently included OFCs such as the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands Ridley Citation2007 Hudson Citation1998a has compared the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas and concludes that the specific development of these OFCs can only be explained by analyzing the behavior of transnational actors eg American and Canadian banks and lawyers and important counterpart countries primarily the USA Moreover he emphasizes the key role of trust by foreign financial actors in the particular OFC which takes time to develop and in practice limits the mobility of capital Hudson Citation1998b Hudson Citation2000 confirms the view by Roberts Citation1995 that the status as a British dependency has been beneficial to the Cayman Islands because the independence of the Bahamas in 1973 led to a flight of capital from there to Cayman Besides Economic Geography IR and IPE have contributed significantly to the research about offshore finance in general and the Cayman OFC in particular Palan Citation1998 635 coined one of the most cogent definitions of offshore finance Offshore is legal enclaves distinguished from their onshore brethren not necessarily because of their location but because they define a territory or a realm of activities in which states choose to withhold some or all of their regulations and taxation In that sense offshore signals a profound fissure in the life of the state system it denotes nothing less than the bifurcation of the juridical space of sovereignty into mutually dependent relative spaces Palan et al Citation2010 too stress the importance that the Cayman Islands is a British dependency in fact it is still legally correct to refer to the British Overseas Territories as colonies of the UK Hendry and Dickinson Citation2011 4 Moreover Palan et al Citation2010 report that in 2008 Cayman was the fourth largest international banking center in the world however concentrating only on shortterm financing An important point that Palan et al Citation2010 highlight is that most OFCs and Cayman in particular act as secrecy jurisdictions Secrecy through opaque financial structures played a key role in the corporate scandals of Enron Olympus and Parmalat as well as in the nearcollapse of the large hedge fund LTCM which all had significant subsidiaries in Cayman According to the Tax Justice Network the Cayman Islands is number five in the 2015 Financial Secrecy Index which combines a secrecy score with a global scale weight in financial services exports TJN Citation2015a Cobham et al Citation2015 Caymans relatively high secrecy score of 65 however is lower than those of other major OFCs such as Switzerland 73 or Singapore 69 reflecting regulatory improvements in recent years TJN Citation2015b The analysis of the Cayman Islands OFC by Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 focuses primarily on legal aspects but nonetheless represents one of the most comprehensive endeavors to trace the development of this jurisdiction since the 1960s Their core argument is that the success of the Cayman OFC stems primarily from what they call the collaborative policymaking process that includes local politicians and regulators foreign experts mainly lawyers from Canada and the USA as well as British officials Moreover Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 argue that the high reliability of the Cayman legal system based on English common law and  even more important  its ability to innovate have been crucial for the rise of the Cayman Islands to one of the largest financial centers in the world A central example that Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 discuss is the creation of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority CIMA in the mid1990s the legislation for CIMA was developed together with the leading Cayman law firm Maples  Calder founded by two British lawyers in the 1960s and the Bank of England Finally Harrington Citation2016 24 has argued that the creation of the Cayman Special Trust Alternative Regime STAR law in 1997 represented a crucial innovation as it eliminated the need for a trust to have beneficiaries  another step in the cooptation of characteristics of the corporate structure making trusts more convenient for use in commercial investment Besides the academic literature on the Cayman OFC there are analyses from governmental and international organizations The United States Government Accountability Office GAO has conducted a study about the factors that cause US citizens and corporations to shift financial activities to the Cayman Islands In addition to the obvious motivation to save taxes another reason was to simplify transactions with third countries the good reputation of the Cayman Islands for stability legal certainty and compliance with international standards also seems to play an important role for the success of this jurisdiction GAO Citation2008 In 2009 the IMF has assessed the regulation of the Cayman Islands financial center The locally available expertise in matters of financial law and accounting  mainly provided by large international advanced business services firms  is identified as an important competitive advantage of this jurisdiction The greatest danger to the success of the Cayman Islands OFC according to the IMF Citation2009 11 is reputational risk  the potential loss of confidence by foreign investors Finally the OECD found Cayman to be largely compliant with international standards of tax information exchange OECD Citation2013 The various studies presented here have analyzed a range of important aspects concerning the development of the Cayman Islands OFC However the most obvious research gap is that there is no publication that has systematically compiled all available data about this OFC  both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different financial segments Such an anatomy of all relevant financial data is a fundamental prerequisite for a profound and comprehensive analysis of this pivotal OFC The Cayman OFC can be analytically separated in three distinct yet interrelated segments banking direct investment and portfolio investment OFFSHORE BANKING Banking represents the historical foundation upon which Cayman has built its OFC During the 1960s the Cayman Islands enacted a series of laws tailored to attract financial business from abroad especially banks TJN Citation2015b The crucial decision that enabled the later development of the Cayman Islands OFC was to remain under British sovereignty when in 1962 Jamaica which had governed Cayman became independent Expatriate lawyers from Britain and Canada drafted many Cayman laws either copying them from the Bahamas or adapting British laws Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 Through its history as a British colony the Cayman Islands inherited English common law This is of central importance to the success of the Cayman OFC because financial actors from Anglophone countries USA UK Canada etc are familiar with it and because in the English legal tradition law evolves in a bottomup fashion from individual case decisions thus significantly facilitating transnational finance The key difference between common law and civil law is that in general Anglophone common law only stipulates what is prohibited whereas civil law France Germany Japan etc identifies what is permitted Vlcek Citation2008 The consequence is that new financial innovations such as ABS CDOs or hedge funds can be set up easily because strict regulation is only put in place in case of conspicuous misconduct or strong pressure from powerful foreign actors The Bahamas was one of the biggest offshore banking centers in the 1960s When however Nassau experienced political instability in the late 1960s leading to the independence of the Bahamas from the UK in 1973 Cayman was ready and took over much of the fleeing business Hudson Citation1998a Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 Ridley Citation2007 During the 1970s and 1980s Cayman experienced rapid growth in offshore banking due to the liberalization and deregulation of finance pursued primarily by the USA and the UK as well as the development of the Euromarkets  themselves a kind of offshore market because Britain decided to withhold regulations on the trading of foreign currencies in the City of London Burn Citation1999 Data on crossborder banking in the Cayman Islands began in 1983 and come from the Bank for International Settlements BIS The BIS collects two kinds of statistics the Locational Banking Statistics LBS and the Consolidated Banking Statistics CBS each using a different methodology The LBS capture the positions of all banking offices resident in the reporting countries 44 in 2015 including Cayman visvis counterparties located in over 200 countries Thus the LBS are based on the principle of residence Note that in the LBS banks record their positions on an unconsolidated basis including intragroup claims and liabilities between subsidiaries of the same bank The CBS on the other hand are based on the nationality of banks These statistics capture the consolidated positions of internationally active banking groups headquartered in the reporting countries 31 in 2015 Data include the claims of foreign subsidiaries of reporting banks but exclude intragroup positions The CBS can thus be used to analyze the exposure of internationally active banks of different nationalities to individual jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands In other words LBS measure all international positions of banks resident in Cayman insideout perspective whereas CBS measure the consolidated international banking claims visvis banks and nonbanks located in the Cayman Islands outsidein perspective Figure 1 shows LBS claims and CBS data for Cayman from end1983 to end2014 The

Offshore Banking Sector 19832014 billion US Display full size Figure 1 Development of the Cayman Offshore Banking Sector 19832014 billion US From 1983 to 1991 the international claims of bank subsidiaries resident in the Cayman Islands LBS grew much faster than the consolidated claims of internationally active banking groups from the countries participating in the CBS on counterparties resident in Cayman From the early 1990s until the mid2000s both measures grew with approximately the same pace LBS increased from about US415 billion to roughly US1125 billion while CBS increased from around US90 billion to over US600 billion Then however LBS grew by 50 in just two years to a peak of over US1800 billion in 20072008 when the global financial crisis began before stabilizing at around US1400 billion from 2012 until today The financial crisis did not stop the upward trend of the Cayman Islands in CBS Consolidated foreign claims briefly declined from over US900 billion in 2007 to US735 billion in late 2008 However since then claims have increased steadily to a new alltime peak of US1060 billion in 2014 or roughly 350 times Caymans GDP These are astonishing dimensions for such a tiny jurisdiction with only about 58000 inhabitants In most segments of crossborder banking Cayman is in the global top five In one specific measure the Cayman Islands is even the third largest jurisdiction This is external loans and deposits of reporting banks visvis individual countries unconsolidated outsidein perspective part of LBS Table 1 shows the 15 largest jurisdictions in this segment of crossborder banking in March 2015 The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 1 External loans and deposits of reporting banks visvis individual countries March 2015 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table The banking statistics by the BIS provide other useful information about the Cayman offshore banking sector as well For example 68 of the claims reported by banking offices located in the Cayman Islands are intragroup 26 are to nonbanks and only 6 are to other banks  and over 91 of all claims are in US dollar BIS Citation2015a These numbers seem to confirm the findings by the IMF Citation2009 that the largest factor for the Cayman banking sector is US banks that transfer clients funds to overnight sweep accounts in the Cayman Islands over 57 of all assets in 2008 Such sweep accounts are profitable for banks and their clients mostly large corporations because they reduce reserve requirements and because excess funds in checking accounts can automatically be swept overnight in instruments such as Eurodollar deposits repurchase agreements or money market funds FDIC Citation2009 Cayman acts as a pure conduit for foreign banks in this segment or in the words of Gonzalo Jalles the CEO of Cayman Finance a significant part of the banking assets registered in Cayman are US banks placing overnight deposits in their own Cayman registered branch The money is effectively being transferred between accounts in NY and not being exposed to how a local banker in Cayman decides to invest it Klein Citation2013 Historically overnight sweep accounts in OFCs such as the Caymans developed because Regulation Q prohibited US banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts Regulation Q was repealed in 2011 and this may partly explain the drop in Cayman LBS from US1800 billion in 2011 to about US1400 billion since then see Figure 1 Existing Regulation D however still limits the number of domestic sweeps to six per month FED Citation2012 Sweep accounts in the Cayman Islands allow US banks to evade Regulation D When the Federal Reserve discontinued the reporting of data on domestic sweeps in March 2012 they measured just over US800 billion The IMF report suggests that sweeps of US banks to their Cayman branches are about the same magnitude According to US Treasury International Capital TIC data in June 2015 total US banking and shortterm securities claims on the Cayman Islands amounted to almost US720 billion or nearly 20 of total US international claims  the second highest value of all countries behind the UK with US860 billion Treasury Citation2016 On balance overnight sweep accounts of US banks in the Cayman Islands increase the complexity of the US financial system reduce reserve requirements of US banks and potentially increase clients risk because Cayman accounts are not insured by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation LBS data can also be used in another way to analyze unconsolidated crossborder positions reported by banking offices located in the BIS reporting countries visvis counterparties resident in the Cayman Islands According to these data the unconsolidated claims by BIS reporting banks to the Cayman Islands measured US1840 billion in March 2015 Interestingly over 56 of these claims are on nonbanks and only 44 on banks BIS Citation2015a In addition a surprisingly high share of 17 is denominated in Japanese yen 70 in US dollar and 7 in euro This is a strong indication that Japan plays a significant yet hitherto not analyzed role in the Cayman OFC Then there are also the CBS which are reported by nationality of banks The consolidated positions on counterparties resident in Cayman allow for a precise geographical analysis of the Cayman offshore banking center Specifically I use consolidated claims on an ultimate risk basis including other potential exposures In March 2015 these consolidated claims on counterparties resident in the Cayman Islands amounted to US1074 billion BIS Citation2015b Before we turn to a granular geographical analysis it is important to note that the vast majority of the claims are on nonbank financial over 73 which in all likelihood is mainly hedge funds and other investment vehicles Table 2 shows the claims of the ten largest countries The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 2 Consolidated claims on the Cayman Islands by nationality of reporting banks March 2015 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table Table 2 clearly shows that banks from the USA and Japan play the dominant role regarding consolidated claims on the Cayman Islands together they account for 63 Switzerland also plays a significant role but mainly due to US72 billion in guarantees extended to counterparties resident in Cayman included in other potential exposures German banks have the largest exposure to Cayman through derivatives contracts US18 billion and American banks have the highest credit commitments with almost US25 billion A detailed analysis of the CBS data reveals several other interesting facts The three categories bundled in other potential exposures derivatives contracts guarantees extended and credit commitments all show a strong peak in 200809 reflecting the prominent role of derivatives and special purpose vehicles legally domiciled in Cayman in the financial crisis Furthermore there are a number of abrupt jumps in the data of some countries for example total claims by US banks excluding other potential exposure leaped from US40 billion in December 2008 to US163 billion in March 2009 Since then US claims have increased steadily to over US283 billion in March 2015 Japanese claims jumped from US226 billion in December 2012 to US284 billion in March 2013 It is unclear whether these leaps only reflect better reporting by banks or genuine increased claims What is striking in Table 2 is that claims visvis banks are negligible compared to claims on nonbank financial This shows that the Cayman Islands do not function as an international banking center in the sense that banks from different nationalities lend to each other but rather that foreign banks mainly American and Japanese ones lend money to hedge funds and other investment funds Foreign banks resident in Cayman mostly conduct intragroup transactions in US dollar During the last thirty years the Cayman Islands has become one of the largest international banking centers  the global financial crisis notwithstanding However this section has shown that we need to dissect the anatomy of the Cayman offshore banking sector in order to understand its role in the international financial system which lies mainly in being the offshore jurisdiction of choice for US and Japanese banks The next section turns towards the dissection of Cayman direct investment DIRECT INVESTMENT Before we analyze the geography of Cayman inward and outward direct investment it is necessary to briefly discuss what direct investment means The huge domain of investment is separated into direct investment and portfolio investment Portfolio investment is defined as equity or debt instruments that are held passively to make financial gains the characteristic feature of FDI by contrast is the aim of the investor to exert control over a foreign company UNCTAD Citation2015a Globally the segment of portfolio investment is much larger than direct investment The former amounts to US48 trillion and the latter measures US28 trillion IMF Citation2015 Citation2016 This discrepancy is even more distinct for the Cayman Islands because a significant part of global FDI is greenfield projects ie the building of new facilities The tiny size of the domestic Cayman economy precludes significant inflows of greenfield FDI Hence foreign portfolio investment is much larger than FDI and the vast majority of Cayman direct investment has to be related to finance Table 3 shows the ten largest counterpart countries of the Cayman Islands for both inward direct investment IDI and outward direct investment ODI The data are from the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey CDIS by the IMF The Cayman Islands does not participate in the CDIS However IDI and ODI counterpart values allow the IMF to derive data for Cayman The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 3 Inward and outward direct investment stocks of the Cayman Islands 2014 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table CDIS data are available only since 2009 Cayman direct investment has more than doubled in just five years IMF Citation2015 However comparable to banking we do not know if these numbers reflect genuine growth or just better reporting In 2014 total Cayman IDI amounted to about US550 or over 180 times the GDP of the Cayman Islands  a very high value Note that Cayman direct investment is likely even higher than these numbers suggest because we do not have the corresponding direct investment data from other large OFCs such as Bermuda the British Virgin Islands BVI or Jersey Cayman ODI US540 billion is lower than IDI the difference of US17 billion is either Cayman direct investment into nonreporting OFCs or outward portfolio investment We can assume this because given the tiny size of the domestic Cayman economy virtually all inward investment portfolio and direct investment has to leave the jurisdiction again possibly changing its form while passing through Thus the Cayman Islands and other OFCs with minuscule GDPs are pure entrept jurisdictions concerning investment The United States is by far the largest source of direct investment with 52 of total IDI into Cayman see Table 3  Data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA allow us to dissect US ODI to the Cayman Islands more precisely The BEA only publishes US ODI data for United Kingdom Islands Caribbean which includes BVI Cayman Islands Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands this amounted to US288 billion in 2014 BEA Citation2015 However we can infer from the CDIS data on US ODI that Cayman accounts for almost 100 of this stock Hence it is reasonable to transfer the details of BEA data on United Kingdom Islands Caribbean to the Cayman Islands Thus in 2014 just two categories accounted for 80 of Cayman IDI from the US 1 holding companies nonbank and 2 finance including depository institutions with over 40 each  all categories pertaining to manufacturing are negligible US185 million The USA is also the largest destination for Cayman ODI US100 billion The Netherlands is the second largest source of Cayman IDI and the third largest destination for Cayman ODI US54 billion respectively US76 billion The Netherlands is the dominant global direct investment conduit specializing in Special Purpose Entities SPEs Weyzig Citation2013 has conducted an indepth case study about the Netherlands and found that Dutch SPEs allow multinational enterprises MNEs to avoid paying withholding taxes in many developing and EU countries and enable profit shifting through royalty payments Table 3 shows that the Cayman Islands is involved in this process via direct investment tofrom the Netherlands Luxembourg another large global direct investment conduit plays a similar role as the second largest destination for Cayman ODI US88 billion UNCTAD Citation2015b estimates that developing countries face tax revenue losses of US100 billion per year due to the role of OFCs and SPEs in international direct investment Brazil and China also use the Cayman Islands as a direct investment conduit in fact Cayman is the largest destination of Brazilian FDI IMF Citation2015 A combined ChinaHong Kong would be the second largest destination for Cayman ODI Cayman ODI to ChinaHong Kong has more than doubled from 2009 to 2014 US41 billion to US94 billion IMF Citation2015 Chinese MNEs have been found to channel direct investment through OFCs directly and also indirectly via Hong Kong not only to minimize taxes roundtripping but also to conceal the ownership of assets and to gain access to foreign capital markets Vlcek Citation2013 Buckley et al Citation2015 The BVI also under UK sovereignty is by far the largest offshore jurisdiction concerning Chinese direct investment in 2013 an astonishing US780 billion had flown from there to ChinaHong Kong IMF Citation2015 The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has revealed that  with the help of advanced business services firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers  many relatives of Chinas political and economic elite have set up shell companies in the BVI highlighting the role of OFCs as secrecy jurisdictions Walker Guevara et al Citation2014 The role of the Cayman Islands for Chinese investment seems to be more focused on MNEs from China that seek access to US capital markets The advanced business services firm PriceWaterhouse has devised a legal innovation in 2000 that allowed many Chinese corporations to circumvent Chinas restrictions on foreign investment in industries such as IT ecommerce and education Gillis Citation2012 This legal device is called the variable interest entity VIE VIEs allow Chinese corporations to publicly list abroad usually in the USA and thus to gain access to foreign capital The legal structure works as follows The Chinese corporation is separated into two parts  the businesses that are open to foreign ownership are transferred to a socalled wholly foreign owned enterprise WFOE the restricted businesses are put in the VIE which is owned and controlled by Chinese individuals Then an offshore holding company is created that owns the WFOE typically in the Cayman Islands because until 2014 it had been the only OFC allowed to publicly list corporations in both the USA and Hong Kong Sutherland and Anderson Citation2015 Subsequently the Cayman holding lists its shares in the USA However the problematic aspect had been how to consolidate the restricted businesses that are part of the VIE without violating Chinese rules on foreign investment The solution devised by accounting firms was to mimic ownership through a series of legal contracts between the Cayman company and the VIE These contracts give the Cayman holding enough de facto control over the Chinese VIE that it is able to consolidate it under current accounting rules even though Chinese law actually prohibits foreign investment in this sector Thus this legal structure constitutes a grey zone with considerable hidden risk for investors in the Cayman company because the whole structure rests on the willingness of Chinese authorities to tolerate it In 2014 the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba the Cayman holding that is raised a record US25 billion with its initial public offering IPO in the USA thus probably perpetuating the VIE structure given the sheer size of the IPO However investors in Alibaba have no de jure control over the Chinese corporation as they only own shares in the Cayman holding Alibaba describes the situation to investors in a registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as follows You may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the US federal courts may be limited because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and most of our directors and all of our executive officers reside outside the United States SEC Citation2014 Chinas government seems to tolerate the use of VIEs in restricted sectors but only if the offshore holding is controlled by Chinese individuals through dual class shares or other arrangements Gillis Citation2015 This episode shows that Cayman is at the forefront of new developments in finance that often involve enormous risk for some parties shareholders in this case while benefiting others Chinese founders Cayman itself Furthermore the rise of VIEs supports the argument that there is an advanced business servicesoffshore nexus Wjcik Citation2013a that drives the development of OFCs Haberly and Wjcik Citation2015b have found that Cayman is part of the Anglo Alliance direct investment network acting as a strong link between the Pax Americana and the Greater China subnetworks This section has shed new light on the specific characteristics of Cayman direct investment However even though it already measures about half a trillion US dollar it represents the smallest of the three financial segments The largest segment by far is portfolio investment PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT Equity and debt instruments eg shares and bonds that are held for financial gain ie are below 10 of voting rights represent the bulk of global crossborder portfolio investment The most comprehensive data source for this segment is the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey CPIS by the IMF In mid2015 70 jurisdictions have participated in the CPIS including Cayman However the Cayman Islands reports only portfolio investment held by banks thus excluding the vast hedge fund sector Lane and MilesiFerretti Citation2010 Zucman Citation2013 This renders the official Cayman CPIS data virtually useless In addition to the reported assets the IMF also publishes derived portfolio investment liabilities These data are derived from the 70 reporting countries and cover 234 jurisdictions Especially for nonreporting OFCs or underreporting jurisdictions derived portfolio investment liabilities are extremely useful For mid2015 the Cayman Islands reported outward portfolio investment assets of US61 billion IMF Citation2016 The derived portfolio investment liabilities however reveal that Cayman inward portfolio investment is over US2574 billion  42 times more than the official Cayman data suggest Thus at mid2015 the Cayman Islands have been the sixth largest financial center in the world concerning crossborder portfolio investment The USA has been the largest jurisdiction with US9790 billion followed by the UK US3728 billion France US3049 billion Luxembourg US2926 billion and Germany with US2835 billion IMF Citation2016 The huge discrepancy between reported assets that exclude hedge funds and derived liabilities which include them shows that the hedge fund industry plays a central role for Cayman portfolio investment Zucman Citation2013 The financial geography of the Cayman hedge fund sector is analyzed in detail further below First I disaggregate Cayman portfolio investment in order to identify the largest counterpart countries As Coates and Rafferty Citation2007 have noted however the true nationality ie the ultimate ownership of portfolio investment is hard to verify because investment instruments may crossmultiple jurisdictions The countries participating in CPIS have reported US2574 billion of portfolio investment into the Cayman Islands in mid2015 The largest counterparty by far has been the USA with US1206 billion or 47 followed by Japan US558 billion Hong Kong US343 billion the UK US91 billion and Luxembourg with US83 billion IMF Citation2016 These five countries are responsible for almost 90 of total portfolio investment into Cayman Due to the severe underreporting of the Cayman Islands CPIS data are not useful for determining the destinations of Cayman portfolio investment Japan is the only major counterparty of Cayman that reports portfolio investment liabilities an encouraged item of CPIS in mid2015 Japan measured US51 billion of inward portfolio investment from the Cayman Islands Thus less than one tenth of the Japanese portfolio investment of over half a trillion US dollar to Cayman has flown back A substantial share has probably ended up in the USA According to US Treasury data the value of US securities held in Cayman amounted to a staggering US1506 billion in mid2015 making the Cayman Islands the third largest counterpart jurisdiction behind Japan and China Treasury Citation2016 In fact when excluding longterm US Treasuries of which the central banks or other public institutions from both Japan and China hold more than US1000 billion Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world US portfolio investment into Cayman amounted to US1206 billion Hence Cayman portfolio investment into the USA is US300 billion larger than vice versa It is reasonable to assume that a substantial share of this difference can be ascribed to investors from Japan and Hong Kong that use Cayman as a conduit for portfolio investment into the large American equity markets In 2003 the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority CIMA has created the Retail Mutual Funds Japan Regulations in order to enable Japanese financial institutions to launch hedge and mutual funds domiciled in Cayman eligible for Japanese investors The process included several visits by CIMA personnel to Japan and substantial research to align these specific Cayman regulations to Japanese laws Solomon Harris Citation2006 Thus Cayman acts as a fund conduit for Japanese investors providing them with a degree of secrecy when they invest in the USA in emerging markets and possibly in politically sensitive China Japan Times Citation2012 The combination of US Treasury data for US securities held in Cayman and CPIS data for all other holdings enables us to visualize Caymans position in international portfolio investment Figure 2 shows fourteen large countries in this segment that have significant investment ties with Cayman the size of the jurisdictions is equivalent to their value of inward portfolio investment from the other thirteen economies The Cayman Islands and all portfolio investment into this jurisdiction is shown in red The USA as the dominant country in crossborder investment is put at the center of the graph and colored dark grey as well as the portfolio investment into the USA all other jurisdictions are shown in light grey Jurisdictions have been arranged for maximum visual clarity The figure makes clear that the USA is still the undisputed center for international portfolio investment followed by the UK France Germany and Japan play a much smaller role as destinations of portfolio investment China for which CPIS data became available for the first time in mid2015 is still small in portfolio investment due to strong restrictions for foreign investors see Fichtner Citation2016 for four novel visualizations of global finance Figure 2 shows that Cayman is one of the largest global nodes for portfolio investment but primarily acts as a conduit for investment into the USA either via American roundtripping or from Japan and Hong Kong Luxembourg Switzerland and the UK also report notable portfolio investment into Cayman but on a much smaller scale than compared to the USA Japan and Hong Kong In mid2015 portfolio investment from Cayman to the United States US1506 billion has actually been the largest individual crossborder stock of portfolio investment in the world ahead of US portfolio investment into the UK with US1336 billion note that reserve holdings such as the large amount of US Treasuries held by Japan and China are excluded in CPIS This massive holding of portfolio investment by Cayman residents can only be understood by analyzing the financial geography of the Cayman hedge fund industry The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Figure 2 The Cayman Islands position in international portfolio investment mid2015 Display full size Figure 2 The Cayman Islands position in international portfolio investment mid2015 Until recently data on the global hedge fund industry had been exclusively collected by private companies such as Hedge Fund Research HFR In 2011 the International Organization of Securities Commissions IOSCO began publishing biannual hedge fund surveys These surveys however only cover large hedge funds with assets of more than US500 million In 2014 over 50 of the 1486 large hedge funds surveyed have been domiciled in Cayman IOSCO 2015  for large UK hedge funds the value is even 69 FCA Citation2015 According to the consulting firm OliverWyman in 2013 about 60 of total hedge fund assets have been legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands  14 in BVI 12 in Delaware Clarkson et al Citation2014 Hence both sources indicate that Cayman is the domicile of choice for the global hedge fund industry The fact that the majority of the entire hedge fund industry is legally concentrated in Cayman is remarkable for such a tiny jurisdiction Figure 3 plots the development of total hedge fund assets and Cayman portfolio investment Data for hedge funds are from HFR which maintains a database of over 7500 funds data for derived portfolio liabilities are from the IMF and data for estimated portfolio assets are from Zucman Citation2015 The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Figure 3 Development of Hedge Fund Assets and Cayman Portfolio Investment 20012014 billion US Display full size Figure 3 Development of Hedge Fund Assets and Cayman Portfolio Investment 20012014 billion US The result is astonishing all lines have moved extremely close together from 2001 to 2014 This suggests that 1 Cayman has been able to maintain its role as the leading domicile for hedge funds throughout this period and 2 that the hedge fund industry is significantly larger than the data from HFR indicate Calculations by the author based on CIMAs Investments Statistical Digest suggest that the Cayman hedge fund industry had approximately US2030 billion in assets under management in 2013 net asset value of master funds and standalone funds divided by 082 in order to adjust for the 18 of nonreporting funds see CIMA Citation2014 Thus if Cayman accounted for 60 of total hedge fund assets in 2013 the global hedge fund industry should have amounted to nearly US3400 billion instead of US2630 billion  this is consistent with estimates from eVestment for mid2013 which put global assets under management by hedge funds at US3411 billion Baert Citation2013 The remaining difference between Cayman hedge funds assets of US2030 billion and Cayman portfolio investment of US2200 billion is probably attributable to the estimated 15 of global private equity assets that are domiciled in Cayman Clarkson et al Citation2014 Hedge funds domicile in Cayman because there are no direct taxes because regulation is at once both lax and sophisticated based on English common law and finally because the jurisdiction enables a certain degree of secrecy The Financial Times revealed in 2011 that a small group of jumbo directors sat on the boards of hundreds of hedge funds making it virtually impossible for them to effectively fulfill their fiduciary duties to investors in the words of a quoted expert We have specialist directorship firms building obscenely large portfolios of directorships without even earning a rebuke from the Caymans regulator Jones Citation2011 A case that illustrates how hedge funds use Cayman secrecy is Tiger Global This fund created shell companies in Cayman with firm names including the legal suffices of European countries such as the Dutch NV or the German GmbH Then Blau GmbH Fest NV and other shells build up short positions in several listed corporations whose shares fell significantly after negative research reports emerged which could have been ordered by Tiger Global netting the fund substantial profits Johnson Citation2014 Paradoxically Cayman regulations have to be loose to a certain extent to give hedge funds enough flexibility but at the same time the regulatory infrastructure has to be sophisticated to maintain the image of a trustworthy upmarket OFC to investors and to avoid pressure by foreign countries Probably due to foreign pressure the Cayman regulator began publishing yearly investment statistics in 2008 These data allow for a granular analysis of the financial geography of Caymans giant hedge fund sector which comprised over 11300 funds at end2013 CIMA Citation2014 I do not use data on all registered funds but only on master funds to avoid doublecounting through funds of hedge funds detailed data on standalone funds are not available Master funds had net assets of US1230 billion in 2013 which represents about 60 of total Cayman hedge fund assets About 75 of master fund assets have been invested in North America Canada and the USA and only 19 in Europe probably mainly in the UK Thus there is a strong concentration of hedge fund investment in the USA investment in Canada is likely minor Hedge funds require a range of services to function such as net asset calculation as well as registrar and transfer agency services CIMA data show that the vast majority of these services is being provided in just three jurisdictions all of which are Englishspeaking the Cayman Islands 34 Ireland 28 and the USA 22 Finally there is detailed information about the location of hedge fund managers these data are crucial because they show where the investment decisions are actually being made Again we find a significant geographic concentration in Englishspeaking or Anglophone countries The United States is clearly dominant an extraordinary 70 of all master fund assets have been managed in the USA The UK ie London accounted for 16 This means that approximately 86 of master hedge fund assets have been managed in just these two countries For the USA CIMA statistics provide granular data about hedge fund manager locations New York is the predominant management location with over 40 of all net assets domiciled in Cayman Connecticut accounted for 11 and California for 7 Illinois and Massachusetts accounted for about 3 each while roughly 2 have been managed in Texas New Jersey and Minnesota respectively CIMA Citation2014 Thus just two greater regions acted as the management location for at least 70 of total assets New YorkBoston including Greenwich and Westport in Connecticut and London From research about the world city network we know that New York and London are the two dominant global financial centers Taylor et al Citation2011 Taylor and Derudder Citation2015 Wjcik Citation2013b  drawing on Strange Citation1998  uses the term the New YorkLondon axis or simply NYLON to describe the joint dominance of these to interconnected financial centers see Norfield Citation2016 for an insightful analysis of Londons role in global finance The extreme concentration of global hedge fund managers in these two greater regions however seems unparalleled with the possible exception of the investment banking industry which is also concentrated in NYLON  and strongly connected to hedge funds The AngloAmerica or Anglosphere approach from IR and IPE seems especially apposite to explain the joint dominance of the USA and the UK in global finance Moreover this approach provides a plausible explanation for the huge size and the specific anatomy of the Cayman OFC that this paper has dissected THE ANGLOAMERICAANGLOSPHERE APPROACH The Anglosphere approach by Vucetic Citation2011 7 builds upon constructivism and conceptualizes the community of the Englishspeaking countries as based on a shared racialized AngloSaxon identity a social kind that exists because people believe it exists Vucetic bases his analysis on historical case studies about crucial interactions between the core countries of the Anglosphere USA UK Canada Australia and New Zealand He deliberately chose episodes that directly concern the field of national security as this domain is commonly theorized to represent the leastlikely case for cooperation between sovereign states in an anarchical system of IRs He argues that it clearly is a puzzle for most conventional IR theories how the AngloAmerican war became unthinkable while peace and cooperation became dependable Vucetic Citation2011 20 Hence there is a particularly high level of trust between Anglophone decisionmakers because they generally do not perceive counterparts from the Anglosphere as an other Gamble Citation2006 9 uses the term AngloAmerica and argues that the Anglophone countries represent an imagined community which has not one distinct center but consists of different states and nations such as Australia Britain Canada Ireland New Zealand Scotland Wales and the United States He argues that AngloAmerica is a political space constituted by wider economic political ideological and cultural relationships Gamble Citation2003 86 Scholars have found empirical evidence for the existence of a specific AngloAmerican model of capitalism Hall and Soskice Citation2001 and Amable Citation2003 argue that the Anglophone economies constitute a distinct socioeconomic model  liberal market economies or marketbased economies in which financial markets play a pivotal role Moreover the legal systems of all Anglophone countries and territories are based on common law which facilitates financial activities within this AngloAmerican transnational space Green Citation2015 has shown that an AngloAmerican developmental sphere was crucial to the development of the pivotal Euromarkets in London which in turn led to a transatlantic regulatory feedback loop that induced wider international financial deregulation Thus AngloAmerica has played a key role for financial globalization The revelations about the unparalleled cooperation by the Anglophone countries in the extremely sensitive field of intelligence dubbed the Five Eyes have corroborated the cogency of the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach significantly McGregor Citation2013 Virtually all international socioeconomic statistics treat the Anglophone countries solely on the grounds where they are located geographically ie the UK is seen as part of Europe Australia as belonging to AsiaPacific and Cayman BVI and others as Caribbean The AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach on the other hand suggests that these states and territories generally have much more in common with other Anglophone countries than with neighboring countries and thus should be analyzed together Research by Heemskerk and Takes Citation2016 supports this view Utilizing community detection through modularity maximization they analyze how the largest one million global corporations are connected through interlocking directorates They find evidence for the existence of a globally dominant North Atlantic  Commonwealth Community which integrates the Anglophone countries Applying the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach to the Cayman Islands opens new avenues for explaining the extraordinary size and the unique anatomy of this central OFC The fact that Cayman is under British sovereignty has been seen as central by Roberts Citation1995 and Hudson Citation2000 as this status provides political stability What has not been discussed so far is that this political status also provides a high level of trust to the United States the predominant counterparty of Cayman In 2009 London suspended local government in the Turks and Caicos Islands another British dependency and put the governor in charge for two years due to evidence for widespread corruption Reuters Citation2009 see also Clegg Citation2012 Hintjens and Hodge Citation2012 This event demonstrated that the UK will guarantee stability in all of its offshore colonies such as BVI Bermuda Jersey or Cayman which makes them qualitatively different from aspirant OFCs that are independent such as Panama Belize or the Seychelles The development of the Cayman OFC is inextricably linked with its sovereign power the UK In the 1960s the Colonial Office assisted Cayman as well as the BVI and others with the adoption of British laws in order to establish OFCs reportedly to avoid being left with financially dependent territories in the Caribbean Picciotto Citation1992 Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 However British support for the Cayman OFC continued after London ended development aids to Cayman in the mid1970s supposedly because it was thought that Cayman and other British OFCs brought more business to the City of London than they caused tax avoidance in the UK Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 London also played a key role in repeatedly assisting negotiations with Washington when the USA complained about conspicuous deficiencies in Cayman regulations Arguably only this tripartite relation has made it possible that Cayman became the domicile of choice for the hedge fund industry and the largest holder of US securities excluding Treasuries in the world Thus the Cayman Islands can be conceived as a quintessentially AngloAmerican OFC A final key link between AngloAmerica and the Cayman OFC is the advanced business servicesoffshore nexus identified by Wjcik Citation2013a Virtually all leading advanced business services firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers KPMG ErnstYoung and Deloitte as well as most large global law firms are AngloAmerican ie have the majority of their operations in Anglophone countries primarily in NYLON and are often the result of mergers between American and British firms AngloAmerican advanced business services firms have played a pivotal role for the ascent of the Cayman OFC In fact two former heads of the Cayman regulator CIMA have been recruited from such firms which are involved in the creation of most Cayman laws pertaining to finance Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 The nexus between the UK advanced business services and Cayman can be also be inferred from the very high value of British services exports to the Cayman Islands which have amounted to about US35 billion in 2013 ONS Citation2015 This value is higher than British services exports to much larger countries such as Denmark India or Hong Kong The AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach presented in this paper as one plausible explanation for the unique development of the Cayman Islands OFC is related to but also differs from the concept of the Second British Empire by Palan Citation2015 According to that argument the UK dependencies Bermuda BVI Cayman Jersey Guernsey etc but also former colonies such as Cyprus Hong Kong and Singapore form a Second British Empire in finance which is centered on the City of London This concept is indeed very useful to highlight the ancillary role of the UK colonies for the strong position of the City of London in international finance see also Norfield Citation2016 on this point however I would be skeptical to include Hong Kong and Singapore because both are clearly not under the sovereignty of the UK anymore and also compete with the City in certain financial segments The AngloAmericaAnglosphere concept has the advantage to stress the strong transAtlantic financial integration of the City with New York ie NYLON Whereas the term Second British Empire would suggest that London is firmly in control I would argue that in many cases there is a joint AngloAmerican leadership in international finance see Fichtner Citation2016 for a study of the persistent structural power of AngloAmerica in nine key segments of global finance The analysis of the Cayman Islands OFC in this paper shows that while it is an important factor that this jurisdiction is under UK sovereignty Cayman primarily caters to the interests of American and to a lesser degree also Japanese investors and is not as strongly connected to the City of London,"""Small place big money"".",entertainment

after a lack of support from Microsoft and other big publishers In January the news about big publishers like Microsoft Sony and Nintendo not joining this years Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 event surfaced In March Microsoft confirmed it wouldnt be on the E3 showfloor but said it would costream Xbox Games Showcase as part of E3 Digital Xbox Head Phil Spencer also expressed support for E3 despite this decision Xbox is on the board of the ESA and I think a successful and healthy ESA is critical to what were trying to go do Spencer told IGN So we place our showcase like we always have done at a time where hopefully its convenient for press and even consumers that are going to the E3 event and thats what were trying to do now We will continue to work with ESA in terms of their plans As I said were on the board and we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to help make the E3 successful However as more publishers like Ubisoft pulled out of the event organizers at ReedPop and ESA decided to cancel E3 This was a difficult decision because of all the effort we and our partners put toward making this event happen but we had to do whats right for the industry and whats right for E3 said Kyle MarsdenKish ReedPop Global VP of Gaming We appreciate and understand that interested companies wouldnt have playable demos ready and that resourcing challenges made being at E3 this summer an obstacle they couldnt overcome For those who did commit to E3 2023 were sorry we cant put on the showcase you deserve and that youve come to expect from ReedPops event experiences Microsoft versus Google in cloud battle Recently the search giant slammed the software company by accusing it of anticompetitive cloud practices and said that its upcoming deals with European cloud vendors are not the absolute solution for licensing term concerns Googles comment came as its response regarding the latest antitrust complaints being scrutinized by the European Union regulators Vice President and Head of Platform for Google Cloud Amit Zavery detailed this in his statement to Reuters Theyre selectively kind of buying out those ones who complain and not make those terms available to everyone So that definitely makes it an unfair advantage to Microsoft and ties the people who complained back to Microsoft anyway Whatever theyre offering there should be terms across for everybody not just for one or two theyve chosen and pick and that shows you that they have so much market power they can kind of go and do those things individually My point to the regulators would be that they should look at this holistically even though one or two vendors might settle doesnt solve the broader problem And thats the problem we need to really resolve not individual vendors problems 2nd Gen

midrangers and some entrylevel phones Use the links below to jump to your region UK The new Galaxy S23 starts at 900 unless you engage in tradein deals The Galaxy S22 is still a fairly capable phone and it is a good deal cheaper at 540 This was the last generation of Exynospowered Sphones in Europe but the rest of the hardware is similar enough its not like the S23 got a QHD LTPO display or faster than 25W charging Alternatively you can pick up the Galaxy S21 FE 5G that one does have a Snapdragon chip even if it is the 888 The S22 is the better phone but is it 70 better If youre fine with or actually want a larger 64 display the FE could be better suited to you Alternatively the Poco F4 GT will get you the newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and an even larger 667 display not to mention super fast 120W charging no wireless The cameras arent as good as on the Samsungs though If you want a flagshipgrade camera the OnePlus 10 Pro is still around and packs a trio of Hasselblad modules including an 8MP 77mm tele lens It also uses the 8 Gen 1 chipset and offers both 80W wired and 65W wireless charging for its 5000mAh battery It costs more than the three models above however at 600 The Xiaomi 11T Pro is getting up in age its a 2021 model but it has a Snapdragon 888 for 350 120 less than the S21 FE While it doesnt have a tele cam the 108MP main camera does a decent job at zooming in This phone also has 120W fast charging and a 5000mAh battery no wireless though The Pixel 6a is under 300 and while its replacement the 7a is coming Google has not set a reveal date yet its rumored to launch in June Leaks point to a 500 price tag on the mainland so the 6a will probably stick around as the cheaper option By the way you can get the Pixel 6a bundled with the Pixel Buds Aseries Or you can get the TWS headset on its own for just over 60 Going up against the Pixel is the Galaxy A33 The new A34 is available in the UK already but it costs 90 more Compared to the Google Phone the A33 offers a larger 64 90Hz display vs 61 60Hz a microSD slot and a larger 5000mAh battery with 25W charging vs 4410mAh18W Well make a quick detour through Apple land Amazon offers the iPhone 14 for just under 800 a small discount compared to how much it costs on Applecom If thats too much or you want a smaller phone the iPhone 13 mini is 600 for a 128GB unit The Nokia G22 and Galaxy A13 both have mediumsized screens 65 and 66 respectively The Nokia offers a 90Hz IPS panel with HD resolution the Samsung is sharper but slower with an FHD 60Hz display The G22 has more processing power with the Unisoc T606 chipset which features a pair of A75 big cores vs all A55 cores in the Exynos 850 Its 5050mAh battery also does 20W charging vs 5000mAh 15W Both phones have microSD slots and 35mm headphone jacks Both phones have 50MP main cameras but only the Galaxy has an ultra wide lens 5MP sensor HMD partnered with iFixit to provide guides tools and parts for fixing the G22 at home Samsung does this only for its flagships Well wrap things up with a wide range of Galaxy tablets The Galaxy Tab S8 may offer the best priceperformance ratio All three Tab S8 models use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and start with 8128GB memory configuration they all have card slots The Galaxy Tab S8 has a larger 124 Super AMOLED display compared to the 11 LCD on the vanilla model All three slates offer 120Hz refresh rate The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is the biggest of the bunch and just plain big with a 146 display Between DeX mode and several keyboard options this can replace a laptop If those are too pricey the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite the 2022 rerelease costs less than half the Tab S8 It has a similarly sized 104 LCD but it is a 60Hz panel Also the Snapdragon 720G is anything but powerful Still with a microSD slot and speakers tuned by AKG this can be a great pick for multimedia and casual browsing Or if you just want something cheap the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is down to 120 The 87 1340 x 800px display isnt great and the Helio P22T is slower than even the 720G but at that price this could work as tablet for the little one  if they break it oh well Germany Google IO 2023 is scheduled for May 10 and we should get an update on the nextgen Pixels For now there is the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro which continue to duck under the pricing of Galaxy and iPhone flagships The Xiaomi 13 is normally a 1000 phone Amazon offers it for a bit less It comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset but lacks the triple 50MP camera setup of the Pro model Speaking of the Xiaomi 13 Pro its 1 camera can be yours for 1300 This also includes a QHD 120Hz LTPO display and faster 120W wired charging up from 67W Its a pricey phone but its camera impressed in our recent shootout Last week we listed the whole iPhone 14 generation which had pretty solid discounts on Amazon Those are still available so this week we wanted to focus on the previous generation Apple is still selling the nonPro duo but you can get a better deal on Amazon The Redmi Note 12 4G went on sale just this week and can be had for 200 Thats 100 less than the 5G version though note that the Note 12 5G has double the storage Other than the chipset the two models are pretty similar For another 100 on top of that you can pick up the Redmi Note 12 Pro with double the RAM and a more respectable Dimensity 1080 chipset instead of the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in the vanilla 5G model This one also has faster charging and OIS on its 50MP camera 1156 Alternatively the venerable Samsung Galaxy A52s is still around and can be had for 130 less than the new Galaxy A54 The new model has some advantages though that price gap makes them seem pretty small What the Nokia has going for it is a microSD slot both have 35mm jacks and a stock Android that will be updated to Android 14 and will continue to get security patches until the end of 2024 at least The Nokia X20 costs 50 more than the Realme 9 Pro even though the Realme has the better chipset Dimensity 920 vs Snapdragon 480 and better camera 50MP main with OIS 8MP ultra wide vs 64MP main 5MP ultra wide and faster charging battery 4500mAh 60W vs 18W The Realme also has a 64 90Hz AMOLED display compared to a 667 IPS LCD 60Hz on the X20 India The OnePlus 10T and iQOO 9T both cost the same at 50000 They have large 120Hz AMOLED FHD displays and both are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 The batteries are similar with a slight advantage for the OnePlus 4800mAh150W for the 10T and 4700mAh120W for the iQOO The iQOO 9T has the lightly better cameras though with mostly identical main modules it also offers a better ultra wide 13MP vs 8MP and a short zoom lens  12MP 47mm Samsung started shipping the Galaxy A54 a week ago but initially the 8128GB units were hard to find Its 2000 cheaper than the 8256GB version and you can pick up a 256GB microSD for less than that or go with something bigger a 512GB SanDisk is 3330 The iQOO Neo 6 and Galaxy S20 FE are fairly close in price dont forget to click the 3000 coupon for the Samsung The iQOO uses the Snapdragon 870 chipset the S20 FE the vanilla Snapdragon 865 Both have midsized 120Hz displays FHD AMOLED panels The iQOO stands out with its 4700mAh80W battery vs 4500mAh25W for the Galaxy though it also has 15W wireless The Galaxy S20 FE has a 3x zoom camera 8MP and a microSD slot however Android 13 is likely its last OS update it is a 2020 model after all The iQOO is from mid2022 The vivo Y100 and Y56 went on sale last month They are fairly similar except hat the Y100 has the better screen 638 90Hz AMOLED vs 658 60Hz IPS LCD both FHD better chipset Dimensity 900 vs 700 and better main camera  64MP with OIS and 4K video vs 50MP no OIS no 4K The Y100 also has 44W fast charging for its 4500mAh battery the Y63 has more capacity 5000mAh but only charges at 18W Still its also 5000 cheaper The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G  the SMA146B variant specifically  uses the new Exynos 1330 chipset and has a 66 90Hz LCD with FHD resolution Its 5000mAh battery is as slow to charge as the Y56s it supports only 15W charging and it has a comparable 50MP main camera neither has an ultra wide lens The Tecno Spark 8 Pro is a rare sight in the sub10000 segment  fullfledged Android version 11 but still an FHD display 68 IPS LCD a large 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging and an okay 48MP main camera no ultra wide It also has a microSD slot and a 35mm jack It doesnt have 5G connectivity but the Helio G85 chipset is normally found in much pricier phones USA While Samsung was taking preorders for the Galaxy S23 series it offered a free memory upgrade  an offer that has since expired Amazon is bringing it back though This means that you can get a Galaxy S22 256GB for the same price as the 128GB unit The Galaxy S23 and S23 Ultra switch to 512GB for no extra cost over the 256GB models The Sony WF1000XM5 are just around the corner but the old XM4 left us with little to complain about even after months of usage Currently they are 50 below their usual price Sony also has the highly specific Link Buds which are designed so that you can always hear your surroundings  they have a hole in them For a more traditional design with Active Noise Cancellation you can get the LinkBuds S instead they arent as good as the WF1000XM4 but they cost 50 less too Alternatively you can have the Google Pixel Buds Pro at the same 150 price tag We have reviewed all of these buds so you can read up on which ones will suit you best If the prices are too high for you you can also grab the Pixel Buds Aseries for about half the cost,Each week we bring you a selection of the best phone deals.,entertainment

credibility For generations Swahilis have maintained matrilineal family burial gardens such as this one in Faza town Lamu County Credit Chapurukha Kusimba 2012 CC BYND The legacy of the medieval Swahili civilization is a source of extraordinary pride in East Africa as reflected in its language being the official tongue of Kenya Tanzania and even inland countries like Uganda and Rwanda far from the Indian Ocean shore where the culture developed nearly two millennia ago Its ornate stone and coral towns hugged 2000 miles 3200 kilometers of the coast and its merchants played a linchpin role in the lucrative trade between Africa and lands across the ocean Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China By the turn of the second millennium Swahili people embraced Islam and some of their grand mosques still stand at the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Lamu in Kenya and Kilwa in Tanzania Selfgovernance ended following Portuguese colonization in the 1500s with control later shifting to the Omanis 17301964 Germans in Tanganyika 18841918 and British in Kenya and Uganda 18841963 Following independence coastal peoples were absorbed into the modern nationstates of Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar So who were the Swahili people and where did their ancestors originally come from Ironically the story of Swahili origins has been molded almost entirely by nonSwahili people a challenge shared with many other marginalized and colonized peoples who are the modern descendants of cultures of the past with extraordinary achievements Working with a team of 42 colleagues including 17 African scholars and multiple members of the Swahili community weve now published the first ancient DNA sequences from peoples of the Swahili civilization Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them Colonization affected how the story was told Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Postcolonial scholars including one of us Kusimba pushed back against that view Earlier researchers had inflated the importance of nonAfrican influences by focusing on imported objects at Swahili sites They minimized the vast majority of locally made materials and what they revealed about African industry and innovation But viewing Swahili heritage as primarily African or nonAfrican is too simplistic In fact both perspectives are byproducts of colonialist biases The truth is that colonization of the East African coast did not end with the departure of the British in the middle of the 20th century Many colonial institutions were inherited and perpetuated by Africans As modern nationstates formed with governments controlled by inland peoples Swahili people continued to be undermined politically and economically in some cases as much as they had been under foreign rule Decades of archaeological research in consultation with local people aimed to address the marginalization of communities of Swahili descent Our team consulted oral traditions and used ethnoarchaeology and systematic surveys along with targeted excavations of residential industrial and cemetery locations Working with local scholars and elders we unearthed materials such as pottery metal and beads food house and industrial remains and imported objects such as porcelain glass glass beads and more Together they revealed the complexity of Swahili everyday life and the peoples cosmopolitan Indian Ocean heritage Ancient DNA analysis was always one of the most exciting prospects It offered the hope of using scientific methods to obtain answers to the question of how medieval people are related to earlier groups and to people today providing a counterweight to narratives imposed from outside Until a few years ago this kind of analysis was a dream But because of a technological revolution in 2010 the number of ancient humans with published genomescale data has risen from nothing to more than 10000 today Surprises in the ancient DNA We worked with local communities to determine the best practices for treating human remains in line with traditional Muslim religious sensitivities Cemetery excavations sampling and reburial of human remains were carried out in one season rather than dragging on indefinitely A detailed line drawing captures the way one persons remains were discovered during cemetery excavation at Mtwapa in 1996 Credit Eric Wert 2001 CC BYND Our team generated data from more than 80 people mostly elite individuals buried in the rich centers of the stone towns We will need to wait for future work to understand whether their genetic inheritance differed from people without their high status Contradicting what we had expected the ancestry of the people we analyzed was not largely African or Asian Instead these backgrounds were intertwined each contributing about half of the DNA of the people we analyzed We found that Asian ancestry in the medieval individuals came largely from Persia modernday Iran and that Asians and African ancestors began mixing at least 1000 years ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale Another surprise was that mixed in with the Persians Indians were a significant proportion of the earliest migrants Patterns in the DNA also suggest that after the transition to Omani control in the 18th century Asian immigrants became increasingly Arabian Later there was intermarriage with people whose DNA was similar to others in Africa As a result some modern people who identify as Swahili have inherited relatively little DNA from medieval peoples like those we analyzed while others have more One of the most revealing patterns our genetic analysis identified was that the overwhelming majority of maleline ancestors came from Asia while femaleline ancestors came from Africa This finding must reflect a history of Persian males traveling to the coast and having children with local women One of us Reich initially hypothesized that these patterns might reflect Asian men forcibly marrying African women because similar genetic signatures in other populations are known to reflect such violent histories But this theory does not account for what is known about the culture and there is a more likely explanation Traditional Swahili society is similar to many other East African Bantu cultures in being substantially matriarchalit places much economic and social power in the hands of women In traditional Swahili societies even today ownership of stone houses often passes down the female line And there is a long recorded history of female rulers beginning with Mwana Mkisi ruler of Mombasa as recorded by the Portuguese as early as the 1500s down to Sabani binti Ngumi ruler of Mikindani in Tanzania as late as 1886 Our best guess is that Persian men allied with and married into elite families and adopted local customs to enable them to be more successful traders The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coasts African matriarchal traditions confirms that this was not a simple

triumph,A routine case that meandered for three years suddenly acquired urgency and surged forward at lightning speed from resumption of trial to conviction in 30 days,Courts are established to deliver justice according to law Sometimes justice may stumble but litigants in India can reasonably hope that if they continue the journey on the tortuous path they wil 5169 chars,Courts are established to deliver justice according to law Sometimes justice may stumble but litigants in India can reasonably hope that if they continue the journey on the tortuous path they will get justice eventually With that preface I shall explain a case that has caught the attention of the whole country and stirred passions on either side of the political divide On March 23 2023 a Magistrate in Gujarat convicted Mr Rahul Gandhi of the offence of defamation Section 499 IPC and imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years After pronouncing the sentence the Magistrate suspended the sentence Nonetheless on March 24 Mr Gandhi was disqualified and his seat in the Lok Sabha was declared vacant Here is the path the case travelled 13042019 Mr Gandhi made an election speech in Kolar Karnataka 16042019 Mr Purnesh Modi MLA BJP filed a complaint before a Magistrate in Surat Gujarat that Mr Gandhi had defamed the entire Modi community 07032022 Complainant sought and obtained a stay of the trial of his own complaint from the HC Gujarat 07022023 Mr Gandhis speech in the Lok Sabha on the Adani Groups issues 16022023 Complainant withdrew his Petition before the HC Gujarat 21022023 Trial resumed before the Magistrate 17032023 Trial concluded judgment reserved 23022023 Magistrate delivered a 168page judgment found Mr Gandhi guilty imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment Shortly thereafter the Magistrate suspended the sentence 24032023 Lok Sabha Secretariat notified the disqualification of Mr Gandhi A routine case that meandered for three years suddenly acquired urgency and surged forward at lightning speed from resumption of trial to conviction in 30 days The puzzle is what imparted the urgency Why did the complainant obtain a stay of the trial of his own complaint and why did he nine days after Mr Gandhi spoke in the Lok Sabha withdraw his petition and seek immediate resumption of the stalled trial Who was defamed The complainant alleged that the Modi communitycaste to which he belonged was defamed Frankly I do not know whether there is a community called Modi or if everyone with the surname Modi belonged to one community or caste The Indian Express has explained March 28 2023 that the word Modi does not denote any specific community or caste In Gujarat the Modi surname is used by Hindus Muslims and Parsis There are people with the Modi surname among Vaishnavas Baniyas Kharwas fishermen from Porbandar and Lohanas who are a community of traders The newspaper also found that there is no community or caste by the name Modi in the Central list of OBCs Also there is no Modi in the Central list for Bihar or Rajasthan In the Central list for Gujarat there is Modi Ghanchi For me who had forsworn caste six decades ago and does not recognise caste the entire argument of defaming a communitycaste allegedly 13 crorestrong makes the head spin Punishment Sentence Suspended According to the complaint it was a case of slander Under IPC Section 500 the punishment may extend to imprisonment for 2 years or with fine or with both I know of no case since 1860 when the IPC came into force where the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 2 years was imposed in a case of slander Ordinarily where a sentence of imprisonment for three years or less is imposed the accused is granted bail so that he is a free person to seek relief from a higher court against the conviction and sentence However in this case within minutes of imposing the sentence the Magistrate himself suspended the sentence Advertisement Section 83 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 provides that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction In the case of Mr Gandhi there is a conviction but no sentence that is effective or operating Therefore did he incur a disqualification on March 23 2023 It is a moot question Many have asked the question and are looking for an answer However the powers that be had no doubt whatsoever Within 24 hours whether they had asked the question or not and whether they had found the answer or not the Lok Sabha Secretariat disqualified Mr Gandhi Who can Disqualify Article 1022e of the Constitution of India provides that a person shall be disqualified for being a member if he is disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament Be it noted that the words used are not shall stand disqualified but shall be disqualified implying that an order of disqualification will be necessary The obvious question has been asked by among others Mr PDT Achary former secretary general of the Lok Sabha who has the authority to disqualify Article 103 may contain the answer it says if any question arises the question shall be referred for the decision of the President who shall obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and shall act according to such opinion In Mr Gandhis case the question was not

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/the-two-facets-of-rahul-gandhis-disqualification-8533802/,The two facets of Rahul Gandhis disqualification,Talking of the legal aspect many Congress leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament f 6314 chars,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament following his conviction by a Surat court in a defamation case Congress leaders have taken to the streets in large numbers instead of going to the higher court to seek relief against the order of the CJM court Talking of the legal aspect many Congress leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself The alleged undue haste in sending the notice of disqualification to Rahul Gandhi has also come under severe criticism by the Congress leaders Their legal experts have argued that since the sole basis of disqualification is the sentencing for two years jail term hence suspension of the sentence has to be construed to mean an automatic suspension of the disqualification Even before the Surat court pronounced its verdict on March 23 several legal experts had expressed similar opinions and held that there were indeed very dim chances of Rahul losing his parliamentary seat in the likely event of his conviction and sentencing However in truth such experts need to read the relevant legal provisions afresh It is expressly stated in the sub section 3 of section 8 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two yearsshall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release From a bare reading of the relevant provision it is obvious that disqualification results directly from the conviction Actual imprisonment is not a necessary condition for disqualification Further the intent of the lawmakers who enacted the RP Act undoubtedly was to effect disqualification immediately upon conviction on a criminal charge involving sentence of imprisonment or fine as specified in the section 8 of the Act Their intent is evident from the heading of this section which readsDisqualification on conviction for certain offences Also Read  Here is the election speech Rahul Gandhi was convicted and has lost his MP seat for It is interesting to recall the manner in which Rahul Gandhi publicly tore down in September 2013 a copy of the ordinance brought out by the then government headed by Dr Manmohan Singh to circumvent the SC judgment for the purpose of saving subsection 84 of the RP Act At that time Rahul Gandhi was an idealist young leader eager to project himself as the cleanest politician much like his late father Rajiv Gandhi and committed to the cause of purging politics of criminal elements in India Terming the ordinance as an attempt to block the way to decriminalization of politics which had been cleared by the Supreme Court by their judgment in the Lily Thomas case Rahul had expressed his anger and disgust in no uncertain terms and blasted the impugned ordinance That the ordinance had been brought out by the government of his own party made no dent on his resolve to ensure the withdrawal of the ordinance It is indeed an irony that the very same Rahul Gandhi should fall prey to the absence of the very same instrument of law he had opposed so vehemently about a decade back He could not have imagined this development in his wildest dreams while tearing down the impugned ordinance in a press conference held in 2013 This is not the first time that a legislator has lost his seat upon conviction on a criminal charge Rasheed Masood was the first such lawmaker to lose his seat in the Parliament in October 2013 Since then more than 20 other legislators have been disqualified including Vikram Saini Ashok Chandel Kuldeep Senger all of the BJP and Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party To be fair to Rahul Gandhi it must be conceded that while all these legislators were disqualified on conviction of such heinous crimes as rape of minor and murder he had been held guilty of mere criminal defamation that too for certain words uttered by him during an election speech However as pointed out by eminent lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani the prevailing law so long as the conditions of conviction and sentencing specified in section 8 of the RP Act are fulfilled makes no distinction on the basis of the nature of crime Therefore from a legal point of view there is no merit in the protests of Congressmen on this count However it is high time to make suitable amendments in the law relating to disqualification of members of the parliament and the state legislative assemblies so as to provide for different treatment to the law makers on the basis of the nature of crime they are convicted of It is highly unreasonable to treat someone guilty of defamation by making loose talks at par with those found guilty of rape and murder However talking of the political side of the matter it is obvious that the high moral ground being claimed by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress does not rightfully belong to them in the present political context prevailing in the country His claim of fighting for the democracy in India does not convince anyone in the country in view of the past record of the Congress governments under the leadership of his grandmother who suspended even the fundamental rights of Indian citizens including the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution Indira Gandhi holds a record in dismissing state governments at the drop of a hat including that in the most sensitive state of Jammu and Kashmir The murder of democracy charge was more aptly applicable when the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister NT Rama Rao was dismissed in 1984and was replaced by his finance minister N Bhaskar Rao even when Rama Rao was undergoing treatment in the US Advertisement Similarly the allegation of arrogance Rahul Gandhi is so fond of levelling against the PM does not hold much water given the way Gandhi stubbornly turned down all suggestions to apologise in the courtroom in the case for his defamatory words His claims to be walking in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi is ridiculous It is expected of the leaders of men to be humble enough to apologise when they are obviously in the wrong not to try to turn their follies into virtue with a view to derive political mileage Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh  Kailash Gupta is former director

chars,The democratic process of any country demands transparency and decency These two poles determine the electoral faith of citizens But electoral democracy is just one part of democracy It ensures that demos or the people of the nation have representation in structuring and functioning of the State By having an election their say in making laws is ensured And the law determines the State However do elections ensure democracy or is it the majority Aristotle says the will of the majority is a bad idea because it can undermine the State Democracy in its pristine form concedes to the will wherein various factors decide the majority In the Indian context Dr B R Ambedkar argued that Indian metrics of power are decided with the majority and the minority wherein the majority is both a number and a cultural majority This takes the shape of communal majoritarianism which acts as a selfcontained group that is unable to think of the rest of society Thus there have to be special constitutional provisions to advance the interests of the minorities and protect them from the atrocities of the communal majorities That is how polity is separate from democracy since the latter by nature demands revolution At the other end of democracy is autocracy which if married with the principle of democracy has the ability to produce demagoguery The role of any processual democracy is to ensure good functioning of the State and in return have a civilized society serving the needs of the citizens Also read  Is democracy dying A postcard from a village in Odisha Citizens having rights and duties prescribed by the Constitution ensure their participation in the engine of the State Thus the philosophy of liberalism is often conflated with that of democracy In a coherent form of democratic governance absolutism and fear of autocratic tyranny are balanced by an engaged Opposition An enigmatic process in a democratic society the Opposition like the government is also voted by the people Therefore it is the voice of the public that is unrepresented in decisionmaking The moral cause of the Opposition is to arouse a sense of liberty and patriotism through difficult nationalism In his RPI manifesto Dr Ambedkar had envisaged the work of the Opposition to be vigilant exceeding the onceinfive years elections that do not guarantee real democracy Recently Opposition parties such as the Congress CPI CPIM AAP JDU Shiv Sena and NCP held a meeting in New Delhi to discuss the authenticity of processual democracy Their suspicion was directed towards the efficacy of electronic voting machines EVMs handling the worlds largest elections The Opposition often talks of technological interference via the Internet and programming of the machine as a tool for manipulation But it must be noted that the parties present at the meeting have ruled or are currently in power in states Doubts over EVMs were also raised by the BAMCEF Backward and Minority Community Employees Federation They even launched a nationwide agitation on the issue Advertisement The research community has demonstrated its defiance of EVMs A 2010 study by Prasad Halderman and Gonggrijp observed that EVMs are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot Computer scientists from Italy and the US found that the system was open to compromise Though one must take into account the efficiency of conducting elections via EVMs the possibility of corrupting a gadget is easily possible The Government of India has been accused of deploying Pegasus software to spy on its citizens Systems run by the Internet are prone to cyberattacks as was proved in the case of Irans nuclear facility at Natanz Cyberattacks involve theft of confidential data to manipulate programmes With the public still ignorant of technological advances the existence of esoteric knowledge on software manipulation makes EVMs an unfavourable option for many So how does one theorize the modern world in the womb of technology that is giving birth to new democracy The Opposition should start by demonstrating its seriousness over EVMs and not simply bemoan every election The complaint should be directed against the Election Commission and not towards a government or a party that is bound to change Advertisement Suraj Yengde author of Caste Matters curates Dalitality and is currently at Oxford University,"In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo reflects on the importance of electoral

towards batters was revealed in his book and then executed in some fashion against the Delhi Capitals batsmen,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing h 5228 chars,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture  what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing helmets guards and pads to face him All you know is that you hate them Perhaps hates a strong word Or it isnt because all they want to do is make you look bad Theyll want to hit you for a boundary and if they do a slowmo of the shot will follow on the big screen to embarrass you even more A commentator will say you bowled too full too short or too wide and pick apart your technique Twitter will go into overdrive and say youre s or something and at the end of the day the captain will be asked in his press conference if you should be dropped for the next game writes Wood Compound this with 400 in four overs an envy inducing opening duo and a track that just offered 193 runs on it in the first innings with more dew settled on the surface And also the fact that his last IPL experience didnt go quite well Pulling a shutter down on all of it Wood steamed in to bowl that first delivery Trying to keep his strides short as he would mention later I feel at ease doing that charging in and letting it fly And just as he landed hard on that left foot with the impact shifting his toe right to the tip of his boot Wood let the ball fly Banged in short forcing a fivefeetsix Prithvi Shaw to hop and defend it down with all his might A hundredandforty something registered on the speed gun Quickest of the evening so far Itd get quicker The short ball has for long been the Achilles heel in Shaws short career So Wood delivered another Quick short but wide Now a little further up Softening him but keeping it quick And then he took it out of the proverbial hat A 1473kph fuller delivery angled in Pierced between the bat and pad to rattle the off stump About six months ago Wood had conceded he was almost done with Test cricket Good heavens he wasnt The 33yearold was in fact using the T20 stage to showcase his Test cricket arsenal A typical red ball setup to get that wicket One brings two here lads The most common of slip cordon phrases wouldve worked its way through his head There is no other reason that explains him catering to an almost identical pace and length off the next one Mitchell Marsh had been Australias top run scorer across the three ODIs and series in India He was used to such wickets and conditions having taken the attack to bowlers on these very surfaces On Saturday night however he stood posing for a straight drive as his off stump was cleaned up behind him Two wickets in two balls and Delhi sent in the closest they could to a Don Bradman For Sarfaraz Khan Wood packaged a Ctrl CV Shawstopping combo Short good length and full on the off Not a run was scored off the bat in that over This while the injury prone quick struggled with the dew I fall at even the best of times He had managed to bowl in a practice game under the same conditions during the evening at the same venue But at training you dont have the same intensity that you have during a match Intensity on which the Super Giants had to bank on for at least another over in a row David Warner had batted the most deliveries for Delhi so far Having been recently exiled from the Australian Test team there couldnt have been a better preAshes Test for the DC captain against one of Englands best Advertisement First up a 148 clicks banger that forced him to hop and fend deep in his crease Followed by a test of quick footwork to defend a good length ball on the off Then a 144 clicks short one which was negotiated for a single  the first off Wood Seeing as the new batter was on strike he decided to throw in a final surprise card and take the pace off In his threedelivery setup to Sarfaraz the England pacer catered only to the short length but turned down his speed from 140 to 137 kph A little more on the ball wouldve taken Sarfarazs uppercut over the long leg boundary Instead he was caught a couple of meters ahead Almost falling down while attempting the shot off a vicious incoming delivery Two overs Three runs Three wickets It wasnt quite game set match to Lucknow but Delhi never quite recovered from that Wood spell A spell meticulously worked on having tested its antagonists as if it were on a Test cricket morning and not under the lights during a franchise league The plan and preparation for it Morne Morkel LSG fast bowling coach has been really good with me Just try to bowl similar to what I do for England Wood shared with the player of the match trophy in his hand for a first five wicket haul in IPL 2023 This is the ideal format for him

dittatura dei generali alla democrazia dal blocco culturale alla Korean Wave londa coreana Che Andrew Jackson docente di Korean Studies alla Monash University di Melbourne cos spiega a 7 Durante i quasi 30 anni di dittatura i sudcoreani non potevano viaggiare allestero a meno che non avessero pi di 50 anni appartenessero a una buona famiglia oppure avessero motivi di lavoro o di studio Per avere il visto bisognava pagare un sacco di soldi Uno dei messaggi che i dittatori usavano era cultural blockade  un embargo della cultura Tutto questo fino al 1987 Lanno in cui fu introdotta la democrazia nel 1988 la Corea avrebbe ospitato le Olimpiadi Il professore Jackson racconta che prima di allora la produzione di film uno dei veicoli principali di emancipazione e di crescita era inesistente dallestero ne arrivavano pochissimi da Hollywood da Hong Kong in ogni caso tutti politicamente innocui Ma cerano dei buchi nel muro del regime e qualche film italiano o la nouvelle vague francese arrivava illegalmente Le video cassette venivano duplicate e diffuse ognuno cos creava il proprio cinema un cinema underground La diffusione dei film avveniva nei campus universitari poi i giovani andavano a vederseli nei club o in sale private La copertina di Kim Jiyoung nata nel 1982 di Cho NamJoo La moglie coreana di Min Jin Lee dal quale  stata tratta anche una serie televisiva

relationships and geopolitics surrounding international oil trading continue to evolve a spate of recent transactions and agreements have crated chatter that the petrodollar may be losing its longtime global dominance,The US dollar has been the dominant currency for international oil trades for decades A spate of   recent deals and bilateral agreements involving key oil sellers and buyers has created chat 6158 chars,The US dollar has been the dominant currency for international oil trades for decades A spate of   recent deals and bilateral agreements involving key oil sellers and buyers has created chatter that the petrodollars dominance could be fading getty Following up on last weeks assessment of the rapidly evolving complexion of the world order in crude oil trading a spate of recent oilrelated international deals raises questions about whether the dominance of the petrodollar is evolving as well While no one has been surprised by Russias responding to western sanctions by pressuring its oil buyers to conduct transactions in roubles recent deals made among other nations to conduct trades in crude and petroleum products using other currencies have raised more eyebrows Examples Of Recent Deals So what is all the chatter about Here are a few examples of recent international deals and new alliances that are raising questions about the future of the petrodollar On March 28 Brazil and China two members in the increasingly influential BRICS Alliance announced an agreement to conduct all future trade transactions using their own currencies China ranks as Brazils biggest trading partner On March 8 Reuters reported that Indian customers have paid for most Russian oil in nondollar currencies including the United Arab Emirates dirham and more recently the Russian rouble multiple oil trading and banking sources said On March 29 Saudi Arabia announced it has agreed to become a dialogue partner in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization a Chinaled political economic and security organization designed to compete with similar Western organizations This latest indication of strengthening ties between Saudi Arabia and China came just just weeks after the Kingdom and Iran announced an agreement to reestablish diplomatic relations that had been brokered by China weeks after the Kingdom and Iran announced an agreement to reestablish diplomatic relations that had been brokered by China Also on March 28 French oil giant Total Energies announced it had completed its first purchase of liquefied natural gas LNG from Chinese oil company CNOOC using the Chinese Yuan as the currency These and other agreements conducted in recent months have led to speculation that as oil markets continue to evolve the petrodollar could be losing its influence Some Background While a high percentage of international crude oil trades had long been conducted in US currency the petrodollar was more formally established as the global currency of mark for such trades in 1973 in the wake of the first Arab oil embargo Then the Richard Nixon administration executed an agreement with Saudi Arabian Prince Fand Ibn Abdel Aziz in which the Saudi Kingdom agreed to conduct its oil trades in US dollars in exchange for US military support and hardware The establishment of this arrangement between what at the time were the largest buyer of crude oil the United States and the biggest exporter of the product Saudi Arabia created a paradigm that other importing and exporting nations quickly began to follow Since that time a strong majority of international oil trades have traditionally been conducted in US currency ie the petrodollar Today even amid global tensions shifting international trade arrangements and a spate of new deals to conduct transactions in competing currencies like the Russian rouble and the Chinese Yuan a recent analysis by PhD economist Anas Alhajji managing partner of Energy Outlook Advisors points out that fully 60 of official foreign exchange reserves conducted in Q1 2022 were transacted using US dollars according to IMF data Alhajji adds Yes with the rise of the euro Japans yen and Chinas yuan the US dollar lost some ground but here is the shocker based on the most recent data from the International Monetary Fund IMF the US dollars share is where it was in 1995 What The Future Could Hold Though Russia and a few other oil producing countries have pressured buyers to conduct trades in nondollar currencies for years there is no question that the divisive nature of Vladimir Putins war on Ukraine has caused such pressures to rise In our interview in February SP Global Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin pointed out that just 37 of the worlds 195 countries are enforcing western sanctions applied to Russia exacerbating alreadyextant international divisions Such divisions and pressures to trade outside the petrodollar seem likely to only continue to increase as Russias war lingers on without resolution The ongoing rise of China as a geopolitical power and competitor to US international dominance and the postWWII liberal world order also seems certain to increase pressure on the current petrodollar system The heightening influence of the BRICS Alliance and its plans for expansion seems likely to also result in stronger competition to the US dollar in international trades BRICS members Brazil Russia India China and South Africa voted last year to consider admitting new members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed recently that more than a dozen nations have since expressed an interest in joining the group Saudi Arabia has been frequently mentioned as a likely possibility to make that move Other countries rumored to have expressed an interest include Egypt Indonesia Turkey Thailand and the United Arab Emirates All of these factors could lead to declining influence of the US and its currency in international dealings Still while recognizing all of these factors Alhajji emphatically states that the US dollar is losing ground but it is not losing dominance Bottom Line There can be little doubt that the United States is in the process of gradually pulling back from the role it adopted at the end of WWII to become the worlds global policeman Despite their major rhetorical differences this gradual pulling back has been a prevailing feature of the presidencies of Barack Obama Donald Trump and Joe Biden It is not an accident that the influence of the petrodollar has declined apace with this US pullback For now though diminished the petrodollar remains the dominant currency for trades in oil and petroleum products But that status will continue to evolve along with the ongoing realignment of global trade and geopolitical alliances,"As the price of oil falls, the value of the US dollar has risen.",entertainment

Services   USCIS field office in Tukwila Washington on March 3 2020 Photo by JASON REDMONDAFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Department of Homeland Securitys regulation that allows the spouses of H1B visa holders to work a significant victory for highly skilled foreignborn professionals their families and the companies that employ them US District Judge Tanya S Chutkan granted the defendants DHS motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs Save Jobs USA motion Intervenors Immigration Voice and Anujkumar Dhamija as well as amici curiae comprising more than forty companies and organizations    filed briefs in support of Defendants motion noted the opinion We are thrilled that the Court agreed with our view that the law allows spouses of people here in the United States suffering in decadeslong green card backlogs caused by NationalOrigin based discrimination to at least have the right to work in the United States while they wait in these discriminatory backlogs said Immigration Voice President Aman Kapoor in a statement that referenced percountry limits which lead to longer wait times for employmentbased immigrants from certain countries particularly India The spouses of H1B visa holders now can have a level of assurance that the work authorization granted them in 2015 will be more difficult for future administrations to take away since it is based on a regulation that the court has said is a valid exercise of the power Congress delegated to Homeland Security to set the conditionsincluding work authorizationon admission of nonimmigrants according to William Stock of Klasko Immigration Law Partners Stock notes A future administration would have to go through the notice and comment rulemaking process again and would have to establish that the economic costs of depriving the US workforce of tens of thousands of skilled workers would outweigh any economic benefit asserted from the changed rule This decision confirms that tens of thousands of H4 employeeshighly skilled and critical members of their teamsare lawfully employed said Paul Hughes of McDermott Will  Emery The courts correct analysis follows decades of consistent practice and recognition that the Executive may determine categories of visa holders eligible for employment Hughes drafted the amicus brief for over forty companies and organizations The H4 Rule is lawful noted the brief On the merits Plaintiff has presented no basis to invalidate this enormously consequential rule To the contrary it has been uncontroversial for decades that DHS is empowered to authorize the employment of lawfully admitted noncitizens andparticularly in view of the important interests just describedit exercised that power in an eminently reasonable manner here The companies and organizations that filed the amicus brief included Amazon Apple Business Roundtable US Chamber of Commerce Cisco Systems FWDus Google Intel Microsoft and others H4 Spouses And The Global Battle For Talent Citing the need to compete for global talent in 2015 Obama administration officials issued a rule to allow the spouses of H1B visa holders to work in the United States Under the regulation if an H1B professional husband or wife has an approved immigrant petition I140 a key step in obtaining an employmentbased green card a spouse in H4 dependent status is eligible for an employment authorization document EAD The rule also applies if the H1B professional has waited a year since filing an I140 petition or permanent labor certification and was extending H1B status beyond six years While this regulation has benefited many spouses their families and the US economy it is much more restrictive than Canadas rule which grants work authorization to all spouses of skilled workers wrote economist Madeline Zavodny in a 2022 National Foundation for American Policy NFAP analysis Zavodny estimates almost 90 of the spouses of H1B visa holders have at least a bachelors degree and over half have a graduate degree Zavodny recommended allowing all spouses of H1B visa holders to work USCIS certainly has the authority to extend the ability to work to all H1B spouses And making employment authorization for spouses incident to status would avoid the gaps in employment that spouses have suffered due to USCIS processing delays said Jon Wasden of Wasden Law in a 2022 interview The recent court decision supports Wasdens view H4 employment authorization is critically important to the affected individuals employers like amici and the health of the overall economy according to the companies and organizations represented in the amicus brief The provision of employment authorization to certain H4 visaholders has become by necessity a vital component of the immigration system Not only is this employment authorization immensely significant to the tens of thousands of families that have organized their lives around the availability of H4 employment but it also brings critical benefits to the companies including amici and their members that employ these skilled motivated and vibrant individuals as valued colleagues In all these individuals contribute immediately to Americas overall economy and the nations continued global economic competitiveness Court Rejected Argument DHS Lacks Authority To Provide Work Authorization To H4 Spouses Save Jobs USAs primary argument was Congress never gave DHS the authority to provide work authorization to H4 spouses and other foreign nationals But as the DC Circuit has recently explained that contention runs headlong into the text of the INA decades of Executivebranch practice and both explicit and implicit congressional ratification of that practice according to Judge Chutkans opinion The Circuits analysis in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v United States Department of Homeland Security is directly applicable to this case The DC Circuit squarely rejected the argument that DHS lacked statutory authority to authorize employment as part of Optional Practical Training after an international student graduates school noted the judge The DC Circuits holding and reasoning in Washtech apply with equal force in this case according to Judge Chutkans opinion Like the Optional Practical Training program at issue there Defendant promulgated the H4 Rule here pursuant to its timeandconditions and general regulatory authority as confirmed by IRCA Immigration Reform and Control Act    In short Congress has expressly and knowingly empowered Defendant to authorize employment as a permissible condition of an H4 spouses stay in the United States The opinion cites the amicus brief from businesses and organizations DHS and its predecessors have authorized employment not just for students but also for their spouses and dependents For instance DHS has long extended work authorization to spouses of foreign government officials and spouses of employees or officers of international organizations Rather than refuting the straightforward interpretation of the INA Immigration and Nationality Act that permits DHS to exercise that authority Congress has repeatedly blessed it by leaving the relevant provisions of the INA untouched even as it as amended other portions of the statute during the last several decades That constitutes persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress Mindful of controlling precedent in this Circuit this court will not disturb it Court Rejected Plaintiffs Argument On Separation Of Powers And Nondelegation Doctrine Judge Chutkan rejected Save Jobs USAs contention that the H4 regulation violates the separation of powers and nondelegation doctrine citing the WashTech decision which explained how the INAs text and structure establishes the limiting principle to constrain DHSs regulatory authority According to the Washtech opinion pursuant to the Secretarys obligation to exercise its rulemaking power in keeping with the statutes text and structure DHS must ensure that the times and conditions it attaches to the admission of nonimmigrant visaholders are reasonably related to the purpose for which they were permitted to enter Judge Chutkan writes The H4 Rule satisfies that statutory requirement But the requirements mere existence provides an intelligible principle of delegation and is therefore fatal to Plaintiffs nondelegation challenge Court Rejected Argument H4 Rule Is Arbitrary And Capricious Judge Chutkan rejected the argument that the H4 regulation is arbitrary and capricious Plaintiff argues that the H4 Rule reversed without explanation a prior policy established by Congress and DHSie that H4 spouses had no work authorization according to Judge Chutkan The court disagrees As Washtech explained the INA empowers but does not require Defendant to set certain conditions of nonimmigrant visaholders stay in the United States potentially including work authorization Defendants choice to exercise its statutory discretion did not change that policy After Defendant and Intervenors made the same argument in their briefing Plaintiff failed to respond Judge Chutkan wrote that the defendant DHS explained why it decided to authorize work authorization for H4 spouses In doing so Defendant also demonstrated how the H4 Rule is reasonably related to the nature and purpose of the H4 visa class Plaintiff Save Jobs USA initially contends that Defendant entirely failed to consider the negative effect that the H4 Rule could have on American workers according to Judge Chutkans opinion Plaintiff recognizesas it mustthat Defendant did consider that effect and instead takes aim at Defendants methodology for doing so Defendant calculated that even if every eligible H4 spouse took advantage of the rule in the first year the year with the most newlyeligible H4 spouses it would amount to less than 012 of the US workforce notes Judge Chutkan By contrast Defendant noted that commenters predicting negative impacts on American jobs did not provide any empirical support for that prediction In light of that data Defendant concluded that the H4 Rules benefits outweighed its minimal economic costs That suffices to establish a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made    Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the H4 Rule was arbitrary and capricious The summary judgment in favor of H4 spouses DHS and employers is expected to benefit families employers and the US economy The ruling places on firmer legal grounds the ability of DHS to provide work authorization to the spouses of H1B visa holders,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that tightens immigration rules, days after his

paved with 1060 emeralds and completed with two ruby cabochon eyes Entirely articulated the two crocodiles can be worn separately as brooches Both crocodiles are just under a foot in length The jewels she is wearing and her stature in the image show her to be a true reptile lover and reflects her fondness for imposing jewels as part of her style Mara Flix photographed by Ignacio Castillo wearing her Snake necklace commissioned from Cartier   Paris in 1968 Cartier Flix 19142002 is beloved in Mexico and France for films such as Emilio Fernandezs Enamorada 1946 Jean Renoirs French Cancan 1955 and Luis Buuels Fever rises in El Pao 1959 The Mexican diva and archetypal Latin femme fatale carried on her acting career until the late 1960s The crocodile necklace and another piece a large gempaved snake she commissioned Cartier to create are a significant part of the exhibition Cartier Design A Living Legacy at Museo Jumex in Mexico City which will run till May 14 The colorful snake made of platinum white gold and yellow gold is nearly twofoot long and is fully articulated Its covered with 2473 brilliant and baguettecut diamonds weighing a total of 17821 carats and is further highlighted with green red and black enamel It peers through eyes made of two pearshaped emeralds Pierre Rainero Cartier Image Style  Heritage director  JeanFrancois ROBERT Cartier Pierre Rainero whose career with Cartier spans 40 years with the last 20 as Image Style  Heritage director knew Flix when she lived in Paris She had an incredible sense of humor very witty and incredibly cultured Rainero said of her She could speak French fluently almost without an accent And she had a perfect knowledge of what society is She understood Parisian society perfectly She knew how to act and behave Her link with Cartier is from that period And its very interesting how she started to buy pieces from stock meaning already created by us panthers by the way Then she moved to special orders because she wanted panthers in her own style with different attitudes Then she commissioned special orders representing different animals and things You can see she understood that Cartier for her was a companion Platinum and diamond bangle Cartier Paris special order 1934 The client supplied almost all of   the stones Cartier You would be forgiven if you think the focus of the museum exhibition is on Flixs jewels based on the publicity surrounding the event or by reading this story up to now In actuality Flixs pieces though immensely impressive and expressive make up two of the 160 Cartier jewels watches and art objects in the exhibition They were culled from Cartiers inventory of more 3000 historic pieces dating from 1860 to the latter part of the 20th century Known as the Cartier Collection these objects of high design and craftsmanship have been shown at museum exhibitions around the world since 1989 Each exhibition has a different theme created by a guest curator who has access to the collection and the archives The Mexico City exhibition is the 39th such exhibition for the collection Among his responsibilities Rainero is in charge of the acquisition management archival information and the museum distribution of the Cartier Collection objects Ana Elena Mallet exhibition curator Cartier The exhibition is curated by Ana Elena Mallet a Mexico Citybased curator specializing in modern and contemporary design She had access to the jewels plus the archival information which as an art historian she was especially attracted to She created a retrospective of the history of Cartier design and style by dividing the exhibition into five sections The Early Days and the Birth of a Style Universal Curiosity Jeanne Toussaints Taste Wearing Beauty and Measuring Time and Mara Flix and Icons of Elegance Design for a tiara Cartier Paris circa 1906 Proposal for an execution in platinum and diamonds   Graphite and gouache on tracing paper Cartier I really wanted it to be a narrative that you could understand from the first stylesthat garland styleand how it evolved into Art Deco and then the 20s she said Then looking at other cultures and then learn how it changes in the 30s with more volume and different stones when Jeanne Toussaint comes into the picture It really helps to understand how this style developed People at the end could understand why Mara Flix would choose Cartier as her house of preference because they were daring and they were innovating in with different materials aesthetics and techniques At that time going to Cartier was like going to the doctor she added They would tell you what to wear and how to look Maria understood that Cartier could do that How Cartier can translate her style and her will Oiseau Libere brooch gold platinum rosecut diamonds one sapphire cabochon eye coral lapis   lazuli During World War II Cartier designed various pieces featuring caged birds symbolizing occupied France Once Paris was liberated jewels were designed with the patrioticallycolored bird bursting from its cage in an explosion of joy Cartier Mallet was especially excited to curate this exhibition because Cartier previously held an exhibition of its jewels in Mexico City in 1999 and she attended it in the beginning of her professional art career She left the exhibition impressed that jewels can be used in a museum context For me it was really important to understand that this material could also belong in a museum and multiple cultural lectures could be done with this amazing material that is jewelry she said Because of this it was very exciting for me to have the opportunity to work with the Cartier Collection Mallet had several challenges when it came to creating her vision for the exhibition The main one was to tie the exhibition to Mexico and Latin America which was no easy feat since the Cartier archives provided little in this area of expertise and inspiration Why have a Cartier exhibition in Mexico right now There should be Mexican links Mallet said I know Louis Cartier was looking to the orient and to China and India But what about Mexico and South America There was a jewel in the collection that looked like it could be of preColumbian inspiration an unusual platinum pyramid clip brooch commissioned in 1935 with baguette diamonds coming out of its sides and a round oldcut diamond of more than four carats in the center It appears to have been inspired by a Mayan or similar temple but there was no information to prove it It became the first piece in the exhibition Pyramid clip brooch Cartier Paris special order 1935 Platinum round oldcut diamonds one   weighing approximately 420 carats baguette and singlecut diamonds Two identical clip brooches were originally made to be worn separately or as a single piece the client later asked that one of the brooches be set on a bracelet of white gold and black lacquer Cartier We didnt find any proof in the archive but the pyramid was there The first piece in the exhibition That was a South America or Latin America pyramid This is proof they were looking here And of course the end of the show with Maria Felix theres a connection I thought we could tie the Mexican connection in the beginning and the end It is obviously very similar to Mayan pyramid added Rainero But our archives do not have the evidence that there was an image of a pyramid that led to this piece In many other cases we have the inspiration This design is so obvious it says a lot about the imagery of preColumbian architecture that was present in the minds of our people Design for a bracelet Cartier Paris 1934 Executed in platinum and diamonds Graphite and gouache   on tracing paper Cartier Another association with Latin America is the Santos watch It is believed to be the first wristwatch Louis Cartier created this watch in 1904 for Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto SantosDumont who complained that he had difficulty flying while using his pocket watch It was a simple solution to a serious problem that may have made the wristwatch fashionable The fourth section of the exhibition relating to Cartier timepieces includes an area dedicated to the aviator and the Santos watch For Mallet her favorite part of the exhibition was the third section dedicated to Jeanne Toussaint 18871976 one of the most important artistic and design influences of Cartier Louis Cartier named her the director of artistic design in 1933 an unheardof post for a woman at that time She was best known for panther jewels an iconic symbol of the jewelry house During her career she moved from Art Deco jewels to sculptural and threedimensional panther creations typically set with white and yellow diamonds emeralds and onyx Her first panther jewela gold and enamel panther brooch set with a cabochon emeraldwas crafted for the Duchess of Windsor Wallace Simpson in 1948 Her influence at Cartier lasted until she retired in 1970 For me it was really important because I didnt know anything about Jeanne Toussaint Mallet said Cartier having a creative director as early as 1933 And that she was a freespirited woman super independent with a mind of her own in in the 1930s was fantastic How Jeanne Toussaint started looking at the world and trying to bring Cartier into fashion and fashion into Cartier She was very good friends with Coco Chanel and with fashion editors at the time Mara Flixs Snake necklace Cartier Paris special order 1968 Cartier It was also unusual for any single person much less a women in the early 20th century to have such an influence over the artistic style at Cartier In 2017 Cyrille Vigneron Cartiers CEO explained to me that while Cartier has some styles that have become iconic such as Tutti Frutti jewels the Panther and floral patterns the luxury brand creates high jewels of all shapes styles and creativity because each piece is developed around the gems they purchase Basically each work starts with a stone and goes through all sorts of inspirations and openness to the world he said The results of this process are jewels of varying shapes styles and motifs that are still identifiable as Cartier based on the quality of the artistry and craftsmanship Whether its figurative or nonfigurative whether its geometric or some kind of art style or when its just a source of inspiration that is absolutely new he said All of them are Cartier in their way Inside the exhibition space created by architect Frida Escobedo Cartier Space plays an equally important role in the exhibition Mexican architect Frida Escobedo created a darkened environment with recessed vitrines brightened with spotlights allowing the bejeweled objects to standout in the darkness Its not the first such exhibition to use darkened space to focus on the jewels Wallace Chan used this technique in his Hong Kong exhibition and JARs 2013 exhibition space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was so dark that people were bumping into one another But this space at Meso Jumex is different in that it combines a spiritual experience and sense of discovery Not only discovering the jewels but its as if you are in a cave discovering the materials as well Im interested in this idea of a ruin but not the ruin in the sense of decay More like something that is in perpetual construction or in the process of being made Escobedo said I think quarries and some archaeological sites share that relationship Mexican architect Frida Escobedo Cartier To me the idea was of going deeper into the layers of history of the legacy of Cartier The idea of going underground to the origin And then you take these paths that takes you chronologically through all the pieces You can see the references and how they influence each other throughout the history of the house Theres also a frame of reference for each vitrine For example the first piece the pyramid brooch that looks like a Mayan temple is the first piece one encounters at the end of a long and darkened corridor Escobedo says she tried to create this effect throughout the exhibition It was important for us to plan together with Ana Mallet from the logical order of the pieces but also to always have a point of attention and tension so you can see a piece at the end of a corridor or something that was framed that would pull you into the next section Its almost like a teaser to the next section of the exhibition Museo Jumex Cartier The design is based on photos of the ancient Tenayuca pyramid just outside Mexico City taken in the 1930s by artist Josef Albers The walls of the space were made of darkened concrete panels quite large poured individually with textured vertical lines They are mounted on an angle Its a monumental work But also whats nice about it is that you can see the craftsmanship Escobedo said of the exhibition space You can see the nuances of each of the panels At the same time it is very subtle as a background Its rich but its not overpowering the pieces Its just creating a backdrop for them Cartiers pieces in the exhibition combines exceptional materials fine craftsmanship and historical importance However Mallet made a deliberate decision to include only the basic details of each piece in the exhibition Rainero agrees with this decision so those in the exhibition can focus on the forms of the pieces and how the changing style of Cartier through the years relates to how the luxury brand has evolved I think theres a consistency a coherence in the exhibition which is selfexplanatory he said And I think this exhibition is very interesting because like art in general but in many museums the curators want to give as much information about the artist or whatever And sometimes its at the price of the appreciation of each of the works This exhibition for me combines the two because of the way the windows are separated one from the other the number of pieces in each window and the type of lighting It allows the visitor to appreciate the beauty of each of the piece at the same time You understand the message and the thinking of the curator So I think theres a very good balance for the visitor when going through the exhibition,All

a quien se le ofrece un da de trabajo como extra en una pelcula de Bollywood Tu rol Ir a un cajero automtico y retirar algo de dinero En 2018 varios hombres en el estado de Maharashtra pensaron que estaban aceptando un papel secundario en una pelcula pero en realidad los estaban engaando para que se convirtieran en mulas de dinero recolectando efectivo en un ambicioso atraco bancario El asalto tuvo lugar durante un fin de semana de agosto de 2018 y se centr en el Banco Cooperativo Cosmos con sede en Pune En una tranquila tarde de sbado el personal de la oficina central del banco recibi repentinamente una serie de mensajes alarmantes Eran de la compaa de tarjetas de pago Visa en Estados Unidos advirtiendo que podra haber miles de demandas por grandes retiros de efectivo en cajeros automticos por personas que aparentemente usaban tarjetas del Banco Cosmos Pero cuando el equipo de Cosmos revis sus propios sistemas no vieron transacciones anormales Aproximadamente media hora despus solo para estar seguros autorizaron a Visa para que detuviera todas las transacciones de las tarjetas bancarias Cosmos Este retraso result extremadamente costoso Al da siguiente Visa comparti la lista completa de transacciones sospechosas con la oficina central de Cosmos alrededor de 12000 retiros separados de diferentes cajeros automticos en todo el mundo El banco haba perdido casi US14 millones Fue un crimen audaz caracterizado por su gran escala y su meticulosa sincronizacin Los delincuentes haban saqueado cajeros automticos en 28 pases diferentes incluidos Estados Unidos Reino Unido Emiratos rabes Unidos y Rusia Todo sucedi en el espacio de solo dos horas y 13 minutos una extraordinaria movilizacin global organizada y criminal Eventualmente los investigadores rastrearan sus orgenes hasta un oscuro grupo de piratas informticos que haban llevado a cabo una sucesin de estafas anteriores aparentemente ordenadas por Corea del Norte Pero antes de tener una idea ms amplia del robo los investigadores de la unidad de delitos cibernticos de Maharashtra se sorprendieron al ver imgenes de CCTV de decenas de hombres caminando hacia una serie de cajeros automticos insertando tarjetas bancarias y metiendo billetes en bolsas No sabamos de una red de mulas de dinero como esta dice el inspector general Brijesh Singh quien dirigi la investigacin Un grupo criminal tena un encargado que estaba monitoreando las transacciones de los cajeros automticos en tiempo real en una computadora porttil cuenta Singh Las imgenes de CCTV mostraron que cada vez que una mula de dinero intentaba quedarse con algo de efectivo el encargado lo vea y le daba una fuerte bofetada Usando las imgenes de las cmaras de seguridad y los datos de los telfonos mviles de las reas cercanas a los cajeros automticos los investigadores indios pudieron arrestar a 18 sospechosos en las semanas posteriores al atraco La mayora estn ahora en prisin en espera de juicio Singh dice que estos hombres no eran ladrones empedernidos Entre los arrestados haba un mesero un chofer y un zapatero Otro tena un ttulo de farmacia Eran gente noble afirma A pesar de esto l cree que cuando ocurri el atraco incluso los hombres reclutados como extras saban lo que realmente estaban haciendo Pero saban para quin estaban trabajando Los investigadores creen que el secreto y aislado estado de Corea del Norte estuvo detrs del atraco Corea del Norte es una de las naciones ms pobres del mundo pero una parte importante de sus limitados recursos se destina a la construccin de armas nucleares y misiles balsticos actividad que est prohibida por el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU Como resultado la ONU ha impuesto onerosas sanciones al pas lo que ha hecho que su comercio sea altamente restrictivo Desde que lleg al poder hace 11 aos el lder de Corea del Norte Kim Jong Un ha supervisado una campaa sin precedentes de pruebas de armas incluidas cuatro pruebas nucleares y varios intentos provocativos de

gobierno de Corea del Norte est utilizando un grupo de piratas informticos de lite para entrar en bancos e instituciones financieras de todo el mundo para robar el dinero que necesita para mantener a flote su economa y financiar su programa de armas Se cree que los hackers apodados Grupo Lazarus pertenecen a una unidad dirigida por la poderosa agencia de inteligencia militar de Corea del Norte la Oficina General de Reconocimiento Los expertos en seguridad ciberntica nombraron a los hackers en honor a la figura bblica de Lzaro que regresa de entre los muertos porque una vez que sus virus ingresan a las redes informticas es casi imposible eliminarlos El grupo salt a la fama internacional por primera vez cuando el entonces presidente de EEUU Barack Obama acus a Corea del Norte de

Desde entonces el Grupo Lazarus fue sido acusado de intentar robar US1000 millones del banco central de Bangladesh en 2016 y de lanzar el ataque ciberntico WannaCry que intent chantajear a organizaciones e individuos en todo el mundo incluido el Servicio Nacional de Salud de Reino Unido Corea del Norte niega enrgicamente la existencia del Grupo Lazarus y todas las acusaciones de piratera informtica patrocinada por el Estado Pero los principales organismos de seguridad afirman que los ataques de Corea del Norte son ms avanzados ms descarados y ms ambiciosos que nunca Para el robo del Cosmos los hackers utilizaron una tcnica conocida como jackpotting llamada as porque hace que el cajero automtico derrame su efectivo como ocurre al ganar en una mquina tragamonedas Los sistemas del banco fueron inicialmente comprometidos de la manera clsica a travs de un correo electrnico de phishing que abri un empleado e infect la red informtica con un programa maligno Una vez dentro los hackers manipularon el software el llamado interruptor de cajero automtico que enva mensajes a un banco para aprobar un retiro de efectivo Con esto los piratas informticos tenan poder para permitir los retiros en cajeros automticos de sus cmplices en cualquier parte del mundo Lo nico que no podan cambiar era la cantidad mxima para cada retiro por lo que necesitaban muchas tarjetas y mucha gente en el terreno En preparacin para el atraco trabajaron con cmplices para crear tarjetas de cajero automtico clonadas utilizando datos de cuentas bancarias genuinas para crear tarjetas duplicadas que se pueden usar en cajeros automticos La compaa de seguridad britnica BAE Systems sospech de inmediato que era obra del Grupo Lazarus Los haba estado monitoreando durante meses y saba que estaban conspirando para atacar un banco indio Simplemente no saba cul Hubiera sido demasiada coincidencia que fuera otra operacin criminal dice el investigador de seguridad de BAE Adrian Nish El Grupo Lazarus es verstil y muy ambicioso agrega La mayora de los grupos criminales probablemente estaran suficientemente felices salindose con la suya con un par de millones y detenerse ah La logstica involucrada en el atraco al Cosmos es asombrosa Cmo encontraron los piratas informticos cmplices en 28 pases incluidos muchos que los ciudadanos de Corea del Norte no pueden visitar legalmente Fuente de la imagen Getty images Pie de foto Los ciudadanos norcoreanos no pueden viajar libremente Los investigadores de seguridad tecnolgica de EEUU creen que el Grupo Lazarus conoci a un facilitador clave en la web oscura donde hay foros completos dedicados a intercambiar habilidades de piratera y donde los delincuentes a menudo venden servicios de apoyo En febrero de 2018 un usuario que se haca llamar Big Boss public consejos sobre cmo realizar fraudes con tarjetas de crdito Tambin dijo que tena el equipo para hacer tarjetas de cajero automtico clonadas y que tena acceso a un grupo de mulas de dinero en Estados Unidos y Canad Este era precisamente el servicio que necesitaba el Grupo Lazarus para su ataque al Banco Cosmos y comenzaron a trabajar con Big Boss Le pedimos a Mike DeBolt director de inteligencia de Intel 471 una firma de seguridad tecnolgica en los EEUU que obtuviera ms informacin sobre este cmplice El equipo de DeBolt descubri que Big Boss haba estado activo durante al menos 14 aos y tena una serie de alias G Habibi y Backwood Los detectives de seguridad lograron vincularlo con todos estos nombres de usuario ya que us la misma direccin de correo electrnico en diferentes foros Bsicamente est siendo perezoso afirma DeBolt Vemos esto con bastante frecuencia los actores cambian su alias en un foro pero mantienen la misma direccin de correo electrnico En 2019 Big Boss fue arrestado en Estados Unidos y desenmascarado como Ghaleb Alaumary un canadiense de 36 aos Se declar culpable de delitos que incluyen el lavado de fondos de presuntos atracos bancarios de Corea del Norte y fue sentenciado a 11 aos y ocho meses Corea del Norte nunca ha admitido ninguna participacin en el trabajo del Banco Cosmos o cualquier otro esquema de piratera La BBC present acusaciones de participacin en el ataque del Cosmos a la embajada de Corea del Norte en Londres pero no recibi respuesta Sin embargo cuando contactamos previamente al embajador Choe Il respondi que las acusaciones de piratera informtica y lavado de dinero patrocinados por el estado de Corea del Norte son una farsa y un intento de los EEUU de manchar la imagen de nuestro estado En febrero de 2021 el FBI el Servicio Secreto de EEUU y el Departamento de Justicia anunciaron cargos contra tres presuntos piratas informticos del Grupo Lazarus Jon Chang Hyok Kim Il y Park Jin Hyok quienes dijeron que trabajan

importantes que abandonaron el rgimen brind informacin sobre cmo trabajan los piratas informticos en el extranjero En 2017 trabajaba en la embajada de Corea del Norte en Kuwait ayudando a supervisar el empleo de unos 10000 norcoreanos en la regin En ese momento muchos estaban trabajando en obras de construccin en todo el Golfo y como todos los trabajadores de Corea del Norte deban entregar la mayor parte de sus salarios al rgimen Dijo que su oficina reciba una llamada diaria de un encargado de Corea del Norte que supervisaba a 19 hackers que vivan y trabajaban en espacios reducidos en Dubi Eso es realmente todo lo que necesitan una computadora que est conectada a internet afirm Corea del Norte niega haber enviado piratas informticos al extranjero solo trabajadores informticos con visas vlidas Pero la descripcin de Ryu encaja con las acusaciones del FBI sobre cmo operan estas unidades cibernticas desde dormitorios en todo el mundo En septiembre de 2017 el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU impuso las sanciones ms estrictas hasta el momento a Corea del Norte limitando las importaciones de combustible restringiendo an ms las exportaciones y exigiendo que los pases miembros de la ONU enviaran a los trabajadores norcoreanos a su pas para diciembre de 2019 Sin embargo los piratas informticos todava parecen estar activos Ahora estn apuntando a empresas de criptomonedas y se estima

Swahili culture had a matriarchal nature when Persian men married into the culture about 1000 years ago The Swahili retailed this matriarchal feature during colonial rule and modern times Here we see two Swahili women in Zanzibar circa 1890 About a millennium ago long before the age of internet dating Swahili women in eastern Africa paired up with a new type of suitor men from Persia a new study finds Researchers made the finding by studying the ancient DNA of 80 aristocrats buried in six medieval and early modern towns along the Swahili coast they wrote in a new study published March 29 in the journal Nature opens in new tab These international hookups occurred just as Islam was spreading to the Swahili region the researchers noted The study supports historical evidence that Swahili aristocrats are descendants of Persians who married Africans centuries ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale coauthors Chapurukha Kusimba opens in new tab professor of anthropology at University of South Florida and David Reich opens in new tab professor of genetics and human evolutionary biology at Harvard University wrote in The Conversation opens in new tab Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them This tomb site along the Swahili Coast in East Africa is one of the places where scientists uncovered ancient DNA from the Swahili elite Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida The Swahili civilization has existed for thousands of years along the coast of East Africa where they played a key role in the trade routes connecting Africa Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China Swahili people embraced Islam a little more than 1000 years ago fell under colonialist control in the 1500s and did not regain their independence until the mid 20th century The Swahili people were then largely absorbed into modern Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar The question of where the Swahili came from originally and how their unique culture evolved has been subject to debate among academics for at least a century Not all of these debates were carried out in good faith Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Kusimba and Reich wrote Related Polynesians and Native Americans paired up 800 years ago DNA reveals The new study shows that the story of the Swahili is neither straightforward nor far off from the civilizations own legends Anthropologist Chapurukha Kusimba from the University of South Florida made it his life mission to research the Swahili culture After receiving approval from the people of Swahili Kusimba was able to excavate cemetery remains Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida Upon examining the DNA of the medieval Swahili elite some of whom lived up to 800 years ago the scientists discovered that the majority of male ancestors came from Asia  particularly Persia or modernday Iran  while the majority of female

Swahili was by then so entrenched that even the traditionally patriarchal Persian men followed local custom so that they could marry into powerful African families The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coasts African matriarchal traditions confirms

usano password troppo fragili 123456 e password ancora una volta fra le password pi utilizzate  su macitynetit Le aziende continuano a usare sempre le stesse password,Anche i dipendenti delle aziende pi ricche del mondo hanno pessime abitudini nella scelta e gestione delle proprie password A rivelarlo una ricerca di NordPass  da anni che gli esperti di cybers 5584 chars,Anche i dipendenti delle aziende pi ricche del mondo hanno pessime abitudini nella scelta e gestione delle proprie password A rivelarlo una ricerca di NordPass  da anni che gli esperti di cybersecurity ripetono limportanza di scegliere password solide in particolar modo allinterno di contesti aziendali Ma i dipendenti delle societ pi importanti del mondo continuano a ritenere sufficienti credenziali banali come 123456 e password Da un certo punto di vista sembra paradossale che le societ pi ricche del pianeta con tutte le risorse necessarie per investire in cybersecurity si rivelino cos superficiali nella scelta e nella gestione delle password Da unaltra prospettiva per questo fenomeno dimostra ancora una volta che le cattive abitudini sono profondamente radicate in un numero sorprendente di utenti Questa ricerca ribadisce quanto sia importante velocizzare la transizione verso sistemi di autenticazione online alternativi ha dichiarato Jonas Karklys amministratore delegato di NordPass Anche se lanalisi di NordPass sulluso delle password da parte degli utenti di internet non si interrompe mai questanno lazienda ha deciso di concentrarsi nel dettaglio sulle password utilizzate dai dipendenti delle societ pi grandi del mondo da 31 Paesi diversi per proteggere gli account aziendali I ricercatori hanno quindi compilato una lista contenente le 20 password pi utilizzate per ogni settore industriale qui i dettagli Dummies sexy4sho e altre password particolari Secondo lo studio password e 123456 rispettivamente al primo e secondo posto nella classifica delle password pi usate al mondo dellanno scorso vanno per la maggiore anche nelle aziende pi importanti Nei 20 settori analizzati entrambe le password sono rientrate nella classifica delle 7 scelte pi utilizzate In alcuni settori si nota anche una creativit maggiore rispetto ad altri La password dummies  al sesto posto fra i dipendenti del settore dei beni di consumo sexy4sho traducibile in sicuramentesexy  al 16 posto fra quelli del settore immobiliare mentre snowman pupazzo di neve  all11 nel settore energetico E a quanto pare chi lavora nel settore finanziario sembra avere un bisogno urgente di staccare la spina perch le password pi utilizzate sono ready2go pronto a partire vacation vacanza e summer estate La musa ispiratrice delle password Cos come succede fra gli utenti standard le parole del dizionario nomi di persone e Paesi o semplici combinazioni di numeri lettere e simboli sono fra le chiavi pi comuni rilevate da questa ricerca Detto questo il rimanente 32 indica unaltra tendenza interessante I dipendenti delle compagnie pi ricche del mondo adorano le password che fanno riferimento diretto o indiretto al nome di unazienda La ragione sociale il nome di dominio usato dalle password aziendali parte del nome della ditta una sua abbreviazione il nome di un prodotto o di una societ controllata sono fra le fonti di ispirazione pi comuni Password di questo tipo sono al tempo stesso fragili e pericolose Questo perch gli hacker provano spesso password contenenti il nome aziendale per accedere in maniera illecita a sistemi di societ specifiche Non  un caso lesperienza suggerisce che password di questo tipo sono fra le pi comuni I dipendenti spesso evitano di usare credenziali complesse in particolar modo negli account condivisi Per questo motivo si trovano spesso a optare per scelte troppo semplici magari influenzate dal nome dellazienda ha continuato Karklys Numeri e ampiezza dello studio Lanalisi delle password delle aziende pi ricche al mondo  stata condotta in partnership con ricercatori indipendenti specializzati in incidenti di cybersecurity Sono state prese in considerazione le 500 societ pi importanti per capitalizzazione a rappresentare 31 Paesi e 20 settori industriali Stati Uniti 462 Cina 96 Giappone 58 India 42 Regno Unito 4 Francia 38 e Canada 36 sono stati i Paesi pi rappresentati in questa ricerca Per quanto riguarda invece i settori pi coinvolti si possono citare finanziario tecnologico e sanitario Le password sono destinate a morire Lo studio  lultimo di una serie di progetti legati alle password condotti da NordPass negli anni Nel 2021 sono state analizzate le password usate nelle aziende Fortune 500 mentre nel 2022 loggetto dellinvestigazione erano state le password dei manager aziendali pi importanti Ogni anno Nord Pass presenta anche la ricerca delle 200 password pi usate che offre uno sguardo dinsieme sulle tendenze principali in questo ambito Se i trend variano ogni anno a seconda del tipo di pubblico considerato in generale si pu notare come le persone continuino a gestire male le proprie password Sembra chiara la necessit di nuove soluzioni per lautenticazione online come le passkey ha sottolineato Karklys Aziende note per limpegno verso linnovazione come Google Microsoft Apple PayPal KAYAK ed eBay hanno gi adottato questa tecnologia offrendo soluzioni di accesso senza password ai propri utenti Secondo Karklys a breve saranno molte altre le aziende online che seguiranno questo percorso NordPass ha sviluppato una sua soluzione per conservare e gestire le passkey dei propri clienti e riferisce di stare sviluppando un nuovo strumento per le aziende che permetta di integrare in modo facile e intuitivo le passkey allinterno dei propri siti Secondo un report di IBM nel 2022 il furto delle credenziali ha continuato a

entertainment kites have also been utilized to distribute propaganda emit radio signals ward off supernatural forces and spy on others Today most people fly kites for pleasure and fun What you might not know is that in the wrong hands kites are extremely dangerous Data reveals that dozens of individuals are injured each year some even killed by kites One festival alone that occurred in India in January 2023 saw three children lose their lives and another 176 injured What follows are 10 of the most noteworthy times that people were killed when or by flying kites Related 10 Incredibly Tragic Unsolved Child Murders 10 An Indian Boy Electrocuted In Sangareddy India on January 12 2023 a boy and his friends climbed on top of a roof to fly kites The roof belonged to the rented house where one of the boys lived Unfortunately one of the boys flew his kite too close and touched a power line This led the boy to incur severe burns The boy then made the unwise mistake of attempting to remove the kite He later passed away at a nearby medical center The boy is reported to have received burns on over 90 percent of his body while the other two incurred 30 percent burns to their bodies Indias transmission voltage is 765 kV AC the highest voltage power lines can carry and the equivalent of 115000 volts Shocks above 2700 volts are often fatal while shocks above 11000 volts are usually fatal However it is the amount of current the amperes more so than the voltage that determines the outcome 1 9 Man Falls to Death Flying Kite In 2021 a 44yearold man had an unfortunate experience flying a kite The man was flying kites with his neighbors during a Sankranti celebration in Hyderabad India when he fell at least four stories The mishap occurred when the man neared the edge of the buildings terrace and lost his balance It is believed he was not aware that he was so close to the edge Unfortunately the man fell onto the metal gate surrounding the building dying on the scene before he could be transported to the hospital Following the accident the police commissioner requested that people stop flying kites from elevated places The commissioner also requested that parents instruct children not to run into dangerous areas like busy roads while trying to gather kites For context six stories range from 60 to 90 feet 183 to 274 meters tall While people flying kites often survive falls from 20 to 25 feet 61 to 76 meters the greater the height after that the more likely a fatality is to occur One study determined that falls from eight stories 98 feet or 299 meters are almost always deadly2 8 Man Electrocuted by Kite String Indias National Green Tribunal in July 2017 placed a complete prohibition on manja a nonbiodegradable kite string material made of nylon or other synthetics that prove harmful to animals birds and humans Two months later a 33yearold man who resided in eastern India failed to heed this regulation The man was flying a kite from the terrace of his home when it became entangled in hightension wire The manja had been partially made with glass and metal dust and proved to be a good conductor when it became caught up in a 33000volt power line The late mans son who was holding the string experienced shock and was thrown immediately backward The late man who owned a stationery shop owner was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries The mans daughter nephew and niece were also injured while attempting to move the mans hand away from the kite string3 7 Boy Dies after Fall from Giant Kite A fiveyearold boy in Vietnam passed away in 2015 after becoming caught in the ropes belonging to a giant kite The boy was then pulled into the air before falling 65 feet 20 meters to the ground Video recording captures the terrifying moment where onlookers could only watch in terror The kite took off into the air so fast that no one could save him The boy was freed when several of the kite strings snapped After being taken to the hospital the boy was pronounced dead The boy wandered off from his mother while members of the Saigon Kite Club tried to launch the large kite which contained a replica of the Vietnamese flag and was

while spectators hurried to find a safe place On the day the mishap occurred a weather report was issued for a strong wind warning Three others were injured in the incident including two elderly men and a young boy The annual Higashiomi Giant Kite Festival involves large kites made from bamboo and paper To make matters even more surprising this marked the second deadly accident involving a giant kite that occurred in Japan in a tenweek period5 5 Boy Dies after Falling into Gutter While Flying Kite In 2023 a boy in Cuttack India wandered out of his house without telling anyone While flying his kite the child fell into an open drain in the Bidanasi part of town and died At the time the boy left the house his family was sitting around watching television Due to their failure to stop the boy from falling into the drain the Cuttack Municipal Corporation officials later blamed the family for the boys death Construction work on the drain had stopped two months earlier but authorities left the drain open at several points If the Municipal Corporation had covered the drain with concrete slabs the accident would never have occurred This was not the only time that someone was harmed by falling into an open drain that month A few weeks earlier a South Korean journalist fell into an open drain in Bhubaneswar India while enjoying a cup of tea at a roadside stall6 4 Mumbai Boys Throat

other people were killed by kite strings electrocution caused by kites and falling off rooftops while flying kites Many kite flyers in Pakistan attempt to use wire or other sharp kite strings made from ground glass to try to cut rival kite strings or harm other kite flyers This can lead to substantial injuries and deaths for birds people and other animals though Pakistani police arrested more than 700 people for using dangerous kite strings or firing weapons during the festival Law enforcement also seized 282 illegally held weapons In 2006 Pakistani authorities even placed a temporary ban on kite flying following a series of festival deaths As a result of the ban the police arrested over 1000 people for selling or making harmful kite strings Following these 11 fatalities the ban was understandably reimposed 8 2 Man Riding Motorbike Killed by Kite String At the beginning of 2023 a man in Surat India riding a motorbike was killed when a stray kite string slit his neck At the time

a heatwave Streets empty as normal activity becomes impossible Airconditioned rooms fill with silent fugitives from the heat Rooftops are littered with the corpses of people sleeping outside in search of a nonexistent breath of wind The electricity grid then law and order break down Like a medieval vision of hell the local lake fills with halfpoached bodies Across north India 20m die in a week Mr Robinson said he wrote his bestseller published in 2020 as a warning The IndoGangetic Plain which extends from the spine of Pakistan through northern India to the deltas of Bangladesh is home to 700m people and exceptionally vulnerable to the heat pulses that climate change is making more frequent It is one of the hottest poorest and most populous places on earth see map Its electricity grids are unreliable Between 2000 and 2019 South Asia saw over 110000 excess deaths a year due to rising temperatures according to a study in Lancet Planetary Health a journal Last years hot season which runs from March until the arrival of the monsoon in late May or early June was one of the most extreme and economically disruptive on record This years could rival it India has just experienced its hottest December and February since 1901 In March the India Meteorological Department  IMD  and its counterpart in Pakistan  PMD  warned of aboveaverage temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May On March 6th Narendra Modi Indias prime minister chaired a review on hot season preparedness Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority has kicked off a countrywide simulation to test emergency responses to the flooding that can follow extreme heat Despite a relatively cool March the coming weeks could be perilously hot On April 1st Mrutyunjay Mohapatra IMD s chief sounded the alarm again Scientists record heat stress as a combination of temperature and humidity known as a wetbulb measurement As this combined level approaches body temperature 37C it becomes increasing hard for mammals to shed heat through perspiration At a wetbulb temperature of around 31C dangerously little sweat can evaporate into the souplike air Brain damage and heart and kidney failure become increasingly likely Sustained exposure to a temperature of 35C the level Mr Robinson imagines in his book is considered fatal The IndoGangetic Plain is one of the few places where wetbulb temperatures of 35C have been recorded including on several occasions in the scorched Pakistani town of Jacobabad A report by the World Bank in November warned that India could become one of the first places where wetbulb temperatures routinely exceed the 35C survivability threshold The regular temperature last year peaked in Jacobabad which sits at the border of Pakistans provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at 51C Half the towns population of 200000 had by then fled in search of more bearable temperatures Even after the temperature began to ease in early June it was hard to resume regular activity Ali Bahar a dailywage labourer in Jacobabad recalls trying and failing to work in its surrounding fields in June While driving a tractor in 42C heat he felt feverish and dizzy then tumbled from the machine injuring his head Coworkers carried him to a local clinic which dished out the standard treatment of a packet of orangeflavoured rehydration salts Though he was discharged six hours later he was unable to work for a week The temperature record provides a horrifying account of the changes afoot According to the definition of a heatwave used by Indias weather agency which takes into account average annual local temperatures and the duration of the anomaly India saw on average 235 heatwaves every year in the two decades to 2019 more than double the annual average of 99 it saw between 1980 and 1999 Between 2010 and 2019 the incidence of heatwaves in India grew by a quarter compared to the previous decade with a corresponding increase in heatrelated mortality of 27 During last years hot season India experienced twice as many heatwave days as in the same period in 2012 the previous record year Climate change made last years heat pulse 30 times likelier than it would otherwise have been according to World Weather Attribution a global research collaboration That is both because it has raised Indias average annual temperatureby around 07C between 1900 and 2018and because it has made anomalous heat surges bigger and more frequent The magnifying effect of the built urban environment which can be 2C hotter than nearby rural areas is often especially pronounced in Indias concrete jungles Those living in slum housing which offer little air circulation and often use heatsucking materials such as tin suffer the worst of it If the climate warms by 2C compared with preindustrial levels as appears unavoidable such events would be more likely by an additional factor of 220 Even if the world makes more headway on curbing greenhousegas emissions than looks likely vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience wetbulb temperature episodes exceeding 31C which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans according to a paper by Elfatih Eltahir of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colleagues The costs of crippling heat are already vast Even working in the shade on an average summer day in Delhi results in labour losses of 1520 minutes per hour at the hottest times reckons Luke Parsons of Duke University in North Carolina Mr Parsons and colleagues have estimated that India loses 101bn man hours per year to extreme heat and Pakistan 13bn During last years withering hot season the wheat harvest was down by around 15 in both countriesand in some regions by as much as 30 Livestock perished The normal agricultural day became impossible Electricity outages in part caused by increased demand for cooling shut down industry and worse airconditioning India saw blackouts even in pampered cities such as Delhi the capital Schooldays were cancelled or curtailed A study in 2020 by McKinsey Global Institute  MGI  a corporate thinktank estimates that the loss of workinghours to extreme heat in India has risen from 10 of the maximum total before 1980 to 15 today Models suggest that proportion will double by 2030 The effect is hugely exacerbated by how labourintensive India and other hot and poor places are see chart In 2017 heatexposed work accounted for 50 of Indias GDP and employed 75 of the labour force or some 380m By 2030 reckons MGI such work will still make up 40 of GDP and the rising number of lost work hours could put at risk 2545 of GDP or 150250bn Pakistan could lose 659 of GDP due to climate change the World Bank warned last year as increased floods and heatwaves reduce agriculture and livestock yields destroy infrastructure sap labour productivity and undermine health What short of reversing global warming can be done Administrators in Ahmedabad a city in Indias western state of Gujarat offer a guide In 2010 it suffered a heatwave that killed 800 people in a week This was a shocking figure says Dileep Mavalankar As director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar Gujarats capital he helped Ahmedabad design Indias first heat action plan  hap  It recommended several simple but effective measures for example warn people of extreme temperatures advise them to stay indoors and drink lots of water and put emergency services on high alert Today there are estimated to be more than 100 such plans in Indias cities districts and states Karachi Pakistans commercial capital developed a similar plan after a heatwave in the city in 2015 killed 1300 people These steps probably contributed to a surprisingly low death toll during last years extended heatwave Early estimates identified only 90 deaths in India attributable to it The true number was probably much greater but may well have been lower than the 4000 who died on the IndoGangetic Plain from a heatwave in 2015 The fact that last years heatwave was exceptional places such as Jacobabad aside not particularly humid was probably the main reason for this It is also the case that poor places used to intense heat are better at adapting to it than illaccustomed rich ones Some hap s are better than others A new study by the Centre for Policy Research a thinktank in Delhi found that many oversimplified heat hazards by ignoring the role of humidity failed to target vulnerable groups and lacked adequate financing Provisions for forecasting heatwaves are also variable Indias IMD issues a daily heat bulletin with fiveday colourcoded forecasts Pakistan is much further behind The PMD is creaky in technology says Sherry Rehman the countrys minister for climate change To be better prepared we will need better forecasting abilities The two countries would do better by cooperating says the UN They will both increasingly be called on to take much costlier measures such as designing cold shelters rethinking urban planning and building materials and bailing out those unable to work in the heat We are going to have to learn to live in a warmer world says Gabriel Vecchi a scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey The question is how orderly costly or calamitous that learning process will be It is hard to find much comfort in the underlying facts Year by year parts of the poor and crowded IndoGangetic Plain will become increasingly unlivable for days or weeks on end Even the most capable government would struggle to prevent that leading to catastrophe And Indias much less Pakistans is not the most capable This is in fact where Mr Robinsons dystopian novel goes off the rails He imagines the heatwave he describes spurring transformative climate action around the world That was ludicrously unrealistic concluded Francis Fukuyama a political scientist Yet without such action it is hard to see what will stop one of the most dire promises of global warming becoming a horrifying reality ,"In the opening scenes of The Ministry for the Future, the novelist Kim Stanley Robinson imagines what happens to a small Indian town hit by a heatwave",science

production This is a welcome developme 6689 chars,The electric mobility sector is starting to get really exciting now as a lot of the firms that manufacture electric vehicles are starting to seriously ramp up production This is a welcome development as we really need to get electric vehicles to as many markets as soon as practically possible to help supercharge the transition away from fossil fuel powered vehicles One of the leading companies in the EV space is BYD BYD sold just under 190000 EVs in 2020 And in only two years it managed to 10 this to over 1863494 vehicles last year 10 in 2 years how cool is that In that time BYD stopped making full ICE vehicles to focus only on battery electrics and plugin hybrids Its plugin hybrids have also been upgraded with the new models  their Super Hybrid DMi and DMp models This year BYD is planning to sell 36 million EVs which is double the number of EVs it sold last year This would be an incredible achievement should BYD manage it To show how big a deal this would be if the company manages to achieve this in 2020 just over 3 million EVs were sold worldwide from all automakers Now just two years later BYD alone will smash this number by a huge margin Although the majority of these sales will be in BYDs home market a decent chunk of the sales are expected to come from its accelerated push to open up in new markets around the world BYD has been on a roll announcing the entry into new markets on a seemingly weekly basis now BYD has launched some of its new BEVs in several markets around the world including India Thailand Australia Austria New Zealand Cambodia Nepal Laos and Singapore You can even get select passenger and commercial vehicles from BYD in Zimbabwe Kenya and other places on the African continent All of this recent expansion goes to show that a lot of planning has gone into this new aggressive export drive BYD has added yet another new market BYD has launched the Tang SUV Han flagship sedan and the Yuan Plus in Mexico It seems we get these announcements every week now Speaking at the launch Zou Zhou Country Manager of BYD Mexico said To start the passenger vehicle business in Mexico is a dream BYD has been pursuing for years and the dream has come true today Interestingly BYD is continuing with the name Yuan Plus in Mexico just as it is called in China and not going with the name ATTO 3 which has been used in other markets particularly in Europe New Zealand Australia Japan and other Asian nations This is probably because it is also called the Yuan Plus in Colombia and other places in South and Central America and the name was already known in that region from the previous ICE and hybrid versions The data sheet on BYD Mexicos website shows two options for the Yuan Plus the 4992 kWh and 6048 kWh versions BYD Blade Battery with 410 km and 480 km NEDC range respectively BYD also says that the Yuan Plus is a spacious Csegment SUV combining modern aesthetics with exceptional intelligence and efficiency derived from pioneering electric vehicle technology and smart connectivity It has been designed by Wolfgang Egger with the European customer in mind providing a stylish funinspired choice complete with very high levels of standard equipment Reports say the Yuan Plus will start from around 44000 The data sheet on BYD Mexicos websites shows the Tang SUV AWD with a 864 kWh Blade Battery 66 kW AC charging and 110 kW DC charging Reports say the Tang SUV will start from around 78000 The data sheet on BYD Mexicos website also show that the flagship Han sedan AWD has a 854kWh Blade Battery as well as 66kW AC and 110kW DC charging The Han starts from around 76000 BYD also recently partnered with Banco Santander Mexico for vehicle financing Through this strategic cooperation BYD is enabled to provide local consumers with a full range of auto finance solutions Specifically this partnership seeks to facilitate access to all new energy BYD vehicles to customers and noncustomers of the bank with an offer of a 10 down payment and financing of up to 72 months in addition to plans with 0 commission for opening Zhou Zou Country Manager of BYD Mexico said Our strategic cooperation with Santander aims to provide local consumers with firstclass auto finance services and solutions and reduce the financial risks of dealers and customers promoting the transformation to green mobility At Santander we continue to seek new partnerships to make it easier for our customers to acquire vehicles On this occasion we are pleased to go hand in hand with BYD said Julio Ascorve Zermeo CEO of Automotive Financing at Santander Mexico By financing these vehicles we contribute to reducing emissions which gives us an important edge in line with our values of sustainability and commitment to the environment So we have seen two big launches from BYD this week One in Spain and one in Mexico Im looking forward to finding out which markets are next on BYDs radar BYD is also looking to expand its passenger vehicle assembly and manufacturing footprint outside of China Earlier this month BYD started constructing a plant in Thailand that will produce 150000 vehicles per year There have been reports of discussions around setting up a factory in Brazil Perhaps Mexico could be another market BYD can look into seriously and expedite setting up a plant there BYD currently offers the more affordable compact hatchback the Dolphin in select markets The Dolphin was recently spotted testing in Australia and hopefully it will go on sale there soon as well as in other markets in Europe Another small vehicle coming soon from BYD is the BYD Seagull The BYD Seagull is expected to be priced close to 10000 in China This is a great price for a car with a 30 kWh battery a 55 kW motor and a top speed of 130 kmh It will also have a 38 kWh version It goes on sale in China later this month It is these types of small affordable EVs that will accelerate the adoption of electric mobility around the world Images courtesy of BYD I dont like paywalls You dont like paywalls Who likes paywalls Here at CleanTechnica we implemented a limited paywall for a while but it always felt wrong  and it was always tough to decide what we should put behind there In theory your most exclusive and best content goes behind a paywall But then fewer people read it We just dont like paywalls and so weve decided to ditch ours Unfortunately the media business is still a tough cutthroat business with tiny margins Its a neverending Olympic challenge to stay above water or even perhaps  gasp

temperaturas del ocano han aumentado constantemente durante los ltimos aos incluso cuando el enfriamiento del fenmeno de La Nia mantena un control sobre el Pacfico Los ocanos han registrado temperaturas rcord durante los ltimos cuatro aos informaron cientficos en enero Luego a mediados de marzo los climatlogos notaron que la temperatura global de la superficie del mar subi a un nuevo mximo La increble tendencia preocupa a los expertos sobre lo que podra ocurrir en el futuro especialmente porque los pronsticos indican que El Nio est en camino y junto con l impactos como calor extremo ciclones tropicales peligrosos y una amenaza significativa para los frgiles arrecifes de coral La Nia y El Nio son fenmenos naturales en el ocano Pacfico tropical La Nia se caracteriza por temperaturas ocenicas ms fras que el promedio mientras que El Nio trae temperaturas ms clidas que el promedio Ambos tienen una gran influencia climtica en todo el mundo Y es casi seguro que un cambio a El Nio traer consigo temperaturas globales ms clidas Daniel Swain cientfico climtico de la Universidad de California Los ngeles dijo que ya se produce una transicin dramtica de La Nia a El Nio en el Pacfico tropical En este momento la atmsfera y el ocano estn sincronizados y apuntan a que El Nio se desarrollar rpidamente en los prximos meses afirm Los ltimos tres aos han sido algunos de los ms clidos registrados incluso con el efecto de enfriamiento de La Nia Ahora estamos en un cambio dijo a CNN el profesor Adam Scaife jefe de prediccin a largo plazo en la Oficina Meteorolgica del Reino Unido Se desconoce qu tan fuerte ser El Nio que se avecina algunos modelos predicen que podra alcanzar una gran fuerza otros sugieren que ser ms moderado Pero lo que est claro es que adems del calentamiento global causado por el hombre las seales apuntan a que El Nio traer impactos severos y sin precedentes en muchas partes del mundo Aqu hay seis extremos meteorolgicos y climticos a tener en cuenta El mundo podra superar los 15 grados de calentamiento por primera vez El Nio podra por primera vez hacer que el mundo supere los 15 grados centgrados de calentamiento por encima de los niveles preindustriales de mediados a finales del siglo XIX Los pases se comprometieron en el Acuerdo Climtico de Pars a limitar el calentamiento global a menos de 2 grados y preferiblemente a 15 grados en comparacin con las temperaturas preindustriales Los cientficos consideran que 15 grados de calentamiento es un punto de inflexin clave ms all del cual las posibilidades de inundaciones extremas sequas incendios forestales y escasez de alimentos podran aumentar drsticamente Un fenmeno de El Nio fuerte podra empujar al planeta a ese punto dijo Scaife aunque solo sea temporalmente Probablemente tendremos en 2024 el ao ms clido registrado a nivel mundial dijo a CNN Josef Ludescher cientfico principal del Instituto Potsdam para la Investigacin del Impacto Climtico El ao ms clido registrado actualmente es 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte El mundo ya ha visto aproximadamente 12 grados de calentamiento ya que los humanos continan quemando combustibles fsiles y produciendo contaminacin que calienta el planeta Y a pesar de los tres aos de enfriamiento de La Nia las temperaturas se han disparado a niveles peligrosos Europa sufri su verano ms caluroso en 2022 con temperaturas superiores a los 40 grados Celsius 104 Fahrenheit y Pakistn e India experimentaron una ola de calor abrasador donde partes del pas alcanzaron ms de 49 grados Celsius 120 Fahrenheit En ltima instancia si se alcanza el umbral de 15 grados o se pasa por alto por poco realmente no importa dijo Scaife Es la primera vez en la historia de la humanidad que ese valor est al alcance y ese es el punto realmente significativo Cualquiera que sea el nivel exacto de calentamiento que trae El Nio es muy probable que algunos de sus impactos incluidas las temperaturas extremas no tengan precedentes dijo Scaife Cada vez que tenemos un El Nio se suma a una cantidad cada vez mayor de calentamiento global que hemos acumulado Podra haber ms lluvia que rompa la sequa en el oeste California ha visto una avalancha de lluvia y nieve en los ltimos meses Eso podra intensificarse durante El Nio California ya enfrenta amenazas potenciales de inundaciones esta primavera inform la NOAA en marzo despus de que cayera nieve sin precedentes en la Sierra y lluvias torrenciales empaparan el resto del estado Una vez que El Nio entre en accin es probable que gran parte del estado sufra una mayor probabilidad de precipitaciones por encima de lo normal con un mayor riesgo de inundaciones deslizamientos de tierra y erosin costera dijeron expertos a CNN Incluso podra brindar un alivio significativo de la sequa a la cuenca del ro Colorado dijo Brad Rippey meteorlogo del Departamento de Agricultura de Estados Unidos Mientras que La Nia es histricamente un generador de sequa para Estados Unidos continentales El Nio es un rompedor de sequa dijo Rippey a CNN Aunque la ubicacin exacta de la sequa o la falta de ella vara considerablemente de un evento a otro La situacin en el ro Colorado que proporciona agua para beber riego y electricidad a aproximadamente 40 millones de personas en todo el suroeste se ha visto afectada por el uso excesivo y una sequa provocada por el cambio climtico La crisis del agua se ha vuelto tan grave que el gobierno federal anunci cortes de agua obligatorios nunca antes vistos en los ltimos dos aos Jon Gottschalck pronosticador jefe del Centro de Prediccin Climtica de la NOAA ampli la idea de Rippey y seal que una corriente en chorro ms fuerte y extendida del Pacfico corrientes de aire de flujo rpido en la atmsfera superior que influyen en el tiempo del da a da podra elevar las probabilidades de ros atmosfricos para la costa oeste al mismo tiempo que causa precipitaciones ms intensas en el sur Sequa calor y fuego en otros lugares En otras partes del mundo El Nio podra amplificar las sequas las feroces olas de calor y los peligrosos incendios forestales Sudfrica e India corren el riesgo de sequa y calor extremo al igual que las naciones cercanas al Pacfico occidental incluidas Indonesia Australia y las naciones insulares del Pacfico como Vanuatu y Fiji Para Australia que an se recupera de las extensas inundaciones es probable que El Nio traiga un clima mucho ms seco y clido especialmente en las reas orientales del pas Desde 1900 18 de los 27 aos de El Nio han significado una sequa generalizada de invierno y primavera dijo a CNN un portavoz de la Oficina de Meteorologa de Australia Sus recientes inundaciones tambin han aumentado los temores de una temporada de incendios forestales particularmente destructiva ya que el incremento del crecimiento de la vegetacin podra proporcionar combustible para los incendios a medida que el clima se vuelve ms seco y clido India tambin se prepara para los impactos de El Nio que puede debilitar el monzn que trae las lluvias de las que depende para llenar los acuferos y los cultivos El monzn tiende a verse ms afectado cuando hay un cambio de un invierno de La Nia que acabamos de ver a un verano de El Nio que es probable que sea el verano de 2023 dijo Raghu Murtugudde cientfico de sistemas de la Tierra en la Universidad de Maryland El dficit general de lluvias monznicas puede llegar al 15 dijo a CNN El Nio tambin podra hacer subir las temperaturas en India que ya experimenta olas de calor inusualmente tempranas Es un peligro compuesto porque las olas de calor y El Nio tienden a retrasar el inicio del monzn dijo Kieren Hunt cientfica investigadora de la Universidad de Reading en Inglaterra Meses de perodos secos supondran una enorme presin sobre la seguridad del agua afirm Un ocano Pacfico ms clido equivale a ciclones ms fuertes Una de las primeras huellas dactilares de El Nio segn Gottschalck ser evidente en los cambios en la actividad de los ciclones tropicales A diferencia de La Nia El Nio tiende a reducir la actividad de los huracanes en el Atlntico pero crea el efecto contrario en el Pacfico donde las aguas clidas pueden generar tifones ms intensos Los ciclones tropicales a menudo pueden formarse ms al oeste en la cuenca y permanecer ms fuertes por ms tiempo por lo que aumentan los impactos potenciales en Hawai dijo Gottschalck Esto significa ms posibilidades de tocar tierra e impactos impulsados de forma remota como mares ms fuertes y de mayor duracin fuertes lluvias y ms En otras partes del Pacfico Swain dijo que los modelos muestran aguas muy clidas frente a la costa de Per que ya generan precipitaciones inusualmente fuertes e inundaciones en los desiertos Ese es un precursor clsico de un evento significativo de El Nio A medida que El Nio se forme y se fortalezca a finales de este ao Per podra correr un riesgo an mayor de sufrir ms inundaciones El gobierno ya est listo para invertir ms de US 1000 millones en medidas climticas y meteorolgicas para prevenir lo peor Los arrecifes de coral podran sufrir un blanqueamiento catastrfico El Nio es un calentador de ocanos y el agua ms clida es una mala noticia para los arrecifes de coral Cuando se calientan demasiado los corales escupen las algas que viven dentro de su tejido lo que les proporciona tanto su color como la mayor parte de su energa Esto hace que los corales se vuelvan blancos en un fenmeno llamado blanqueamiento Si bien pueden recuperarse si las temperaturas eventualmente bajan el blanqueamiento los pone en mayor riesgo de inanicin y muerte Un perodo particularmente catastrfico de blanqueamiento de corales ocurri entre 2014 y 2017 afectando a todos los arrecifes importantes de la Tierra La Gran Barrera de Coral de Australia registr la muerte de casi el 30 de sus corales en una ola de calor marina rcord en 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte que comenz en 2015 Ms eventos de blanqueamiento masivo continuaron y con El Nio en el horizonte los cientficos estn cada vez ms preocupados por los impactos en el coral que simplemente no ha tenido tiempo suficiente para recuperarse Lo que se predice aqu da mucho miedo dijo Peter Houk profesor del Laboratorio Marino de la Universidad de Guam que estudia el coral en Micronesia Cada vez que viene uno crece un poco ms en intensidad El Nio no significa necesariamente que todo el coral se ver afectado dijo Houk Cada El Nio es diferente y siempre hay otros patrones climticos naturales en juego Pero cuando sucede es brutal asegur Cuando llegue El Nio ser una oportunidad para aprender ms sobre cmo reacciona el coral y dnde pueden aparecer focos de resiliencia dijo Houk Solo quiere que aguante un poco ms Esperamos que las predicciones sean incorrectas y luego podamos comprar algunos aos ms para que los corales se recuperen Ms hielo derretido en la Antrtida El hielo antrtico ya est en problemas y El Nio podra empeorarlo A principios de este ao los niveles de hielo en el continente descendieron a mnimos histricos por segunda vez en dos aos lo que provoc el temor de que despus de aos de altibajos ahora podra estar en una fuerte tendencia a la baja El Nio podra ayudar a acelerar este proceso segn una investigacin reciente que encontr un vnculo entre la fuerza y la frecuencia de los eventos de El Nio y la velocidad del derretimiento del hielo antrtico Los modelos que proyectan un mayor aumento de El Nio producen sistemticamente un derretimiento de la capa de hielo ms rpido que los modelos que proyectan un cambio menor en El Nio dijo a CNN Wenju Cai cientfico investigador jefe de CSIRO la agencia cientfica nacional de Australia Los cientficos vigilan de cerca a la Antrtida porque contiene una cantidad catastrfica de agua en su capa de hielo Aunque es poco probable que la capa de hielo de la Antrtida se derrita por completo tiene suficiente agua para elevar el nivel global del mar en 230 pies 70 metros En el plazo inmediato los eventos de El Nio tienen impactos divergentes en la Antrtida dijo Cai con aumentos y disminuciones en diferentes reas Pero en conjunto indic la tendencia es clara una disminucin general del hielo marino,"El presidente de la Comisin Nacional, Luis Inacio Caldern, y el presidente de la Comisin de Derechos Humanos, Luis Inacio Caldern, han sido informado ayer durante el sbado",science

scandals in the franchise since debuting on 90 Day Fianc The Other Way Palm Springs resident Jenny was a mom to three grownup daughters with grandchildren when she flew to India to get married to Sumit in Delhi on TOW season 1 Jenny was giving up her entire life to be together with Sumit but little did she know the surprise that was waiting for her in India Now four years later Jenny is happily married to Sumit as viewers wonder if hell ever relocate to the USA 90 Day Fianc couple Jenny and Sumit knew each other for almost a decade when they got married in August 2021 Their wedding was the couples secret until Sumit could announce it to his parents They were last seen together in 90 Day Fianc Happily Ever After season 7 which documented how their age difference affected their compatibility as husband and wife However Jenny whos still in India is making things work with Sumit as fans watch Jenny and Sumit on new Pillow Talk episodes SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT 5 90 Day Fianc Couple Jenny  Sumits Age Gap Jenny and Sumit are celebrated as one of the franchises most real couples As a pair they also represent a common storyline that has been seen in the franchise to date The shows initial concept was to document brides coming from Eastern European countries such as Russia to the US It also started to focus on large age gaps between couples including shocking age differences between white women who had met foreign men online and wanted to get married to them The biggest 90 Day Fianc age gap until then between an American woman and her boyfriend might have been between Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi Michael and Angelas age differs by 22 years Before them it was Darcey Silva and Jesse Meester with an 18year age gap However Jenny is a whopping 29 years older than Sumit At present Jenny is 63 years old while Sumit is 34 years old The couple seems to have met a decade ago in 2012 This means when Jenny and Sumit met they were 53 and 24 years old respectively which by all means is a concerning age difference 4 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Catfished Jenny Of course Jenny might have not known Sumits real age when she first met him In fact Jenny didnt even know Sumit He was pretending to be a man called Michael Jones Sumit seemed to have made a fake profile with the name he used at his call center job in Delhi He used it for playing games on Facebook Sumit had pictures of S Club 7 singer Rachels husband Alex Bourne as his display profile When Jenny suspected that Sumits photos came from a magazine he even claimed that a colleague had clicked them Apart from Alex Sumit also used Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoors photos 3 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Was Already Married To Another Woman Its strange and funny how Jenny didnt realize he was pretending to be two different men posting pictures of two completely different celebrities Regardless Sumit continued to hide one more secret from Jenny even after he finally came clean to her and she found him cute Jenny had visited Sumits house in 2012 under the guise of being his friend Jenny even stayed with Sumits family for two months Apart from overstaying her welcome Jenny also welcomed Sumit into her room in the middle of the night She took Sumits virginity Sumit was caught redhanded by his father It seems once Jenny went back to America Sumit was married off to another woman Sumit stayed married to the woman for several years while he continued to date Jenny longdistance But once Sumit started to film 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 1 and started staying with Jenny in a different home than his parents and wife the wife became suspicious She had gone to Jennys door leaving the Palm Springs woman shellshocked while Sumits wife also got the police involved in the altercation that followed 2 90 Day Fianc Star Jenny Tried To Become Hare Krishna Devotee Once Sumit and his exwife divorced the coast became clear for Jenny to get married to him At least thats what Jenny thought because Sumits parents Sadhna and Anil never accepted her as Sumits wife With Sumit waiting for his parents to grant him permission to get married Jenny moved to India again While she waited for Sumit to agree Jennys tourist visa expired and the pandemic struck adding more restrictions on her flying in and out of the country In order to keep staying in India a lawyer suggested Jenny should consider giving up her American citizenship and the benefits that came with it The attorney suggested Jenny had only one technical option left He asked Jenny to apply for a missionary visa through ISKCON which stands for International Society for Krishna Consciousness Jenny laughed at the idea of becoming a Hare Krishna devotee considering shes not a religious person She was filmed visiting the temple and talking to the religious heads to know how she could continue staying in India But the missionary visa wasnt as much of a loophole as it was an obstacle in Jenny and Sumits relationship The last option was for Sumit to get over his cold feet and marry Jenny which he did although in secret 1 90 Day Fianc Star Sumits Mom Does Neti Yoga One of the most disturbing scenes in Sumit and Jennys 90 Day Fianc storyline involved Sumits mother Sadhna doing neti Sumits mother and father were visiting Jenny and his home during 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 3 They wanted to check how much of a daughterinlaw Jenny could be to them considering she was much older than Sumits mother herself Upon entering the house Sumits mother inspected the kitchen and squealed with disgust upon noticing how Sumit and Jenny were staying in unhygienic conditions But then Sadhna did something even more strange during her yoga practice Jenny whos lost weight recently is generally a fit woman for someone whos in her mid60s Yet Sumits parents wanted to test Jennys strength and flexibility They tried to get Jenny to perform various asanas and also neti yoga which involved them cleaning their noses with a thread After pouring mustard oil down their nostrils Sumits mom and dad had inserted a thick piece of thread through their noses and gagged until it emerged out of their throats so they could floss their nasal passages with it The 90 Day Fianc scene was unwatchable because nasal flossing had nothing to do with Jennys daughterinlaw skills Source Sumit

Bilanz die zeigt warum Afghanistans innere Widersprche haben sich immer wieder in der externen Machtagenda verfangen Besonders seine Nachbarn spielen dabei eine destabilisierende Rolle Gemeinsame ethnische Zugehrigkeiten ber Grenzen hinweg haben den Spielplan der Nachbarn erleichtert die ethnische Karte im darauffolgenden Stellvertreterkrieg zu ihrem Vorteil zu nutzen Es berrascht nicht dass Afghanistan seit den 1970erJahren Zeuge von EthnoStammeskriegen geworden ist Das Land ist auch seit Jahrzehnten den Eingriffen externer Mchte ausgesetzt was es zum Schauplatz eines neuen groen Spiels macht Es war ein Labor fr viele Experimente der internationalen Gemeinschaft von denen nur wenige realisiert wurden Externe Akteure haben neue Strategien implementiert gescheiterte Experimente hinter sich gelassen und es den Afghanen berlassen die Scherben aufzusammeln Fr das Verstndnis der sich entfaltenden Krise in Afghanistan kommt der Analyse externer Mchte entscheidende Bedeutung zu Whrend der zwei Jahrzehnte internationaler Intervention in Afghanistan nach dem Sturz des TalibanRegimes im Jahr 2001 wurden erhebliche Fortschritte in den Bereichen MdchenFrauen Minderheitenrechte Demokratie und Menschenrechte erzielt Dieser Beitrag erschien zuerst in der Monatszeitschrift Welttrends Die Wirtschaft des Landes erholte sich Allerdings wurde dies hauptschlich durch internationale Hilfe und Untersttzung erreicht  was die Gewinne im Wesentlichen fragil machte Die Art der internationalen Intervention mit ihrer Betonung auf Projekten mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und schneller Wirkung bot nicht den langfristigen Aufbau von Institutionen die zur Stabilisierung des Landes erforderlich sind Stattdessen hat es sowohl fr die Regierung als auch fr die internationale Gemeinschaft eine Legitimittskrise geschaffen weil es die Grundbedrfnisse der Brger wie Sicherheit Gesundheit Beschftigung und Justiz in den lndlichen Gebieten nicht erfllt hat Die Taliban nutzten diese Legitimittskrise aus  wobei der Aufstand in den abgelegenen Gebieten des Sdens und Ostens wo die Reichweite der Regierung begrenzt war die Untersttzung der Bevlkerung fand Die bernahme von Kabul am 15 August 2021 war daher fr langjhrige Beobachter keine berraschende Entwicklung insbesondere nach der Unterzeichnung des Friedensabkommens der USA mit den Taliban am 29 Februar 2020 Die Zeichen standen seitdem an der Wand Die faktische Abwesenheit der afghanischen Regierung in der Anfangsphase des Friedensprozesses hatte sie weiter geschwcht und unfhig gemacht aus einer Position der Strke heraus mit den Taliban zu verhandeln Nach der bernahme durch die Taliban ist Afghanistan mit einer schweren wirtschaftlichen und humanitren Krise konfrontiert Die USA und die internationale Gemeinschaft scheinen nach ihrem Abzug die Afghanen wieder vergessen zu haben Die Ukraine und der IndoPazifik ziehen die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich Vor diesem Hintergrund steht meine kritische Untersuchung der Rolle der internationalen Gemeinschaft in Afghanistan in einer Reihe von Sektoren  Sicherheit Demokratie und politische Rechenschaftspflicht und schlielich Wirtschaftsmanagement und Regierungsfhrung UnSicherheit DemokratieResistenz Misswirtschaft Erstens ist im Sicherheitssektor offensichtlich dass die Vereinigten Staaten kein Konzept eines Endstaates in Afghanistan hatten selbst als enorme Ressourcen in das Land flossen Ihr Projekt zur Stabilisierung Afghanistans entbehrte einer konkreten Vision Sie schufen eine groe afghanische Nationalarmee nach konventionellen Grundstzen rsteten sie jedoch nicht fr die Herausforderungen des Aufstands aus Probleme wie Korruption Desertionen unzureichende Ausbildung und Waffen haben die Afghan National Defence and Security Forces ANDSF whrend ihrer gesamten Existenz geplagt Es berrascht nicht dass die Afghan National Army ANA und die ANDSF nach der Unterzeichnung des DohaAbkommens noch vor dem Fall Kabuls im August 2021 rasch begannen sich aufzulsen Das ausgehandelte Abzugsdatum gab den Taliban die Oberhand und die Bedingungen des Friedensabkommens sorgten fr enorme Verwirrung unter den afghanischen Sicherheitskrften Fr viele ANDSFMitarbeiter schienen die Bedingungen zu bedeuten dass der Staat die Taliban in der Zwischenzeit nicht bekmpfen sollte Dies wiederum fhrte zu einer Legitimitts und Moralkrise Desertionen und schlielich zum Zusammenbruch des Sicherheitssektors Zweitens war Afghanistan in Bezug auf Demokratie und politische Struktur nicht bereit fr das von der internationalen Gemeinschaft propagierte westliche Demokratieverstndnis Es hatte seine eigenen traditionellen demokratischen Institutionen die in dem Eifer dem Land eine moderne Demokratie aufzuzwingen umgangen wurden Aber das demokratische Experiment schloss Rechenschaftspflicht oder Vertretung im eigentlichen Sinne des Wortes aus Dies wurde insbesondere durch die wiederholten Betrugsvorwrfe deutlich die die Prsidentschaftswahlen 2014 und 2019 beeintrchtigten Als Wahlbeobachter fr eine der Prsidentschaftswahlen wurde ich Zeuge einer wachsenden Unzufriedenheit der Bevlkerung ab 2014 als die Menschen begannen ernsthaften Unmut ber die Wahlergebnisse zu uern die ihre Entscheidungen auer Kraft gesetzt zu haben schienen Infolgedessen wurde die Legitimitt der afghanischen Regierung nicht nur von den Taliban sondern von der Bevlkerung selbst infrage gestellt Die tiefe Polarisierung innerhalb der Regierung der Nationalen Einheit NUG lhmte die Regierung und wirkte sich auf ihre Fhigkeit aus Gesetze rechtzeitig zu formulieren und zu erlassen Die Unterzeichnung des Friedensabkommens mit den Taliban durch die USA diskreditierte die afghanische Regierung weiter und fhrte zu einer schweren Legitimittskrise Drittens verlieen sich die afghanische Wirtschaft und der nationale Handel auf die Hilfe und Untersttzung der internationalen Gemeinschaft Weit davon entfernt sich in Richtung einer autarken Wirtschaft der internen Einkommensgenerierung und der Ausbeutung natrlicher Ressourcen zu bewegen hat die Etablierung einer von Hilfe abhngigen Wirtschaft eine Generation von Eliten und einen Rentierstaat geschaffen Die Eliten haben whrend ihres Aufenthalts im Land Vorteile daraus gezogen einen Groteil ihrer Einknfte aus dem Land geleitet und das Land in den Wochen und Monaten vor der bernahme durch die Taliban verlassen Der Mangel an Einnahmen alternativen Lebensgrundlagen und anderen wirtschaftlichen Mglichkeiten veranlasste viele Afghanen den Mohnanbau wieder aufzunehmen undoder sich dem Aufstand anzuschlieen Ebenso behinderte trotz des enormen Potenzials im Mineralsektor das Fehlen von Regierungsinitiativen die allgemeine Sicherheitslage und der Mangel an regionaler Zusammenarbeit und Konnektivitt die Realisierung des nationalen Potenzials fr Entwicklung Einkommensgenerierung und Beschftigung Projekte wie die Mes AynakKupferminen die 20072008 dem chinesischen Unternehmen

Optimism,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored these questions and more at our BakeOffs and Show Floor Sh,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored 19772 chars,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored these questions and more at our BakeOffs and Show Floor Showdowns at our Data and Analytics Summit in Orlando with 4000 of our closest DA friends and family We did two BakeOffs this year The first featured analytics and BI platform Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders while the other showcased high interest data science and machine learning platforms The BakeOffs are fastpaced fun and informative sessions that let you see leading vendors sidebyside using scripted demos and a common data set in a controlled setting And this years BakeOffs did not disappoint To extend the BakeOff experience to a broader range of vendors including smaller innovators we also did a series of Show Floor Showdowns for analytics and BI data science and machine learning and for data management The Show Floor Showdowns were held on the Exhibit Hall show floor and were based on the same demo script and data set used in the BakeOffs Any vendor that Gartner has covered in any of its research and all vendors that had a booth in the Data and Analytics Summit Orlando Exhibition Hall could apply to participate in Show Floor Showdowns From there participants were randomly selected and invited to present live at the Show Floor Showdown sessions We also gave the demo script and data set to all vendors in the Exhibit Hall to create demos for their booths and to submit for this blog For the vendors that participate in the BakeOff and Show Floor Showdowns it is in equal measure fun and extremely stressful Its a high stakes session where they put everything on the line in front of their arch competitors revealing whats coming and coveted sales tactics all while being judged by attendees It takes a fair bit of preparation extreme commitment and an ability to shine under pressure What Data Did We Use We use the BakeOffs and the Show Floor Showdowns as a platform for data for good This years scenario was to understand the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and the resulting devastating human and economic impact because of unpredictable weather conditions Are there mitigation strategies that can be implemented successfully that could provide policy guidance and reasons for optimism in the face of ever increasing frequency of extreme weather events We gave the vendors data from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD data and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA from the National Centers for Environmental Information They could supplement this data with any other relevant data sets Last years topic was the UNs Sustainable Development Goals In 2021 we explored vaccine effectiveness and inequity using global vaccine data In 2020 we analyzed population health data In past BakeOffs we explored loneliness and happiness data opioid epidemic data traffic fatalities college costs and homelessness The results showing the impact of flooding predictions for the future and reasons for optimism were fascinating This blog highlights some notable findings and the videos from participating vendors BI BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Microsoft Here is the link to Microsofts BI BakeOff video Qlik Key Findings In the US alone theres 367 billion in agricultural commodities at risk to flooding in the US alone There have been 338 weather events that have created over a 1 billion dollars USD plus of damage totaling to 24 trillion in damages altogether and averaging 71 billion per event For most coastal countries climate change and flooding are critical topics of policy and development strategies A large part of underdeveloped Asian countries ranging from Bangladesh to Vietnam are at high risk of flooding events Here is the link to Qliks BI BakeOff video Salesforce Tableau Key Findings Unlike other European countries the Netherlands has the most square meters of land at risk of flooding as well as the greatest population at risk of flooding 70 While there are many factors that can contribute to flood risk such as changes in landuse from urbanization and deforestation there are also natural geographic features that can put certain populations at increased flood risk These factors include  of population at risk average elevation and  of inland waterways throughout a region A big factor as to why Netherlands faces extreme flooding risk is that 15 of the region is comprised of inland waterways As population density increases in major metropolitan areas predisposed to flooding risk to life and livelihood is expected to continue to increase In 2000 the Netherlands had 85 million people at risk of catastrophic flooding In 2040 that number is projected to grow to 102 million Here is the link to Tableaus BI BakeOff video Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Alteryx Key Findings The task was to analyze the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and provide mitigation strategies The objective was to identify highrisk areas the US Department of Interior should focus their resources for river flooding over the next 10 years Climate change may lead to more frequent and severe flooding Through the analysis we found regions with high risk of flooding including Big Horn County in Montana which has a high Native American population at higher risk of safety and economic impact Recommended mitigation strategies include improved infrastructure early warning systems landuse planning and community engagement focused on the middle Rockies surrounding areas Here is the link to Alteryxs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Dataiku Dataiku chose to focus on flood risk by geography and floodings economic impact on commercial insurance policies and claims With a business use case of defining a location and insurance strategy for a proposed warehouse in southeast Florida here are some of the key findings Extreme rainfall and rising sea levels are driving up both flood frequency and insurance costs especially in highrisk Florida areas Southern Floridas Atlantic coast has increased flood risk leading to more and costlier flood insurance claims in areas like Homestead and Miami compared to West Palm Beach and Port Saint Lucie Our analysis suggests prioritizing Hobe Sound or Stuart FL for real estate investment due to no past floods or claims within a 60minute driving radius reducing risks to warehouse contents and distribution routes Interpretation of our machine learning model suggests buying 50k in building coverage and 100k in warehouse content coverage as the latter significantly boosts predicted flood claim payouts Here is the link to Dataikus Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video SAS SAS took the view that mitigating and anticipating flooding events should be focused on the goal of helping people SAS created on top of the traditional statistical and machine learning models to predict events a set of four unique models specifically focused on helping people impacted by flooding An optimization network model cost network flow algorithm to optimally help displaced people reach public shelters and safer areas An optimization network model vehicle routing algorithm to optimize routes and the time it takes to transport displaced people to public shelters and safer areas An autocorrelation forecasting model to identify parameter estimators associated with relevant variables that impact the likelihood of flooding events Based on these estimators SAS created an easy to use whatif dashboard The user can change the variable values to understand how these changes would impact the likelihood of future flooding events A time series regression on referenced spatial data to estimate future flooding locations within hurricanescyclones paths The hope is governments could prepare for a flooding event and consider mitigating actions to help people in future danger Here is the link to SASs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Analytics and BI Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Course5 Intelligence Key insights from Course5 Intelligence include The US states with the highest susceptibility to coastal flooding for a 10year return period are Alaska Delaware Maryland and New Jersey Louisiana Arkansas Mississippi and West Virginia are the US states with the greatest vulnerability to river flooding for a 10year return period During river flooding Louisiana experiences more severe impacts on builtin lands and crops with exposure percentages of 5060 for builtin lands and 4045 for crops based on data from the OECD on river flooding Between the years 2000 and 2020 river flooding in Louisiana caused crop damages worth 270 million and property damages worth 91 billion Heavy rainfall along with storms is one of the primary causes of flooding in Louisiana as evidenced by the graph of flood frequencies vs annual precipitation  Some of the other general reasons for flooding in Louisiana are hurricanes poor drainage levee breaches and deforestation Also based on the historical data there is a very high chance of flooding in Louisiana in the year 2024 with a likelihood of 31 According to ChatGPTs suggestion some of the flood mitigation strategies that could be deployed by the government in Louisiana are improve the drainage system improve building standards improve land use practices and improve emergency response Here is the link to Course5s Show Floor Showdown video Datamatics Key Findings In China Impact of coastal flooding

that based on data from the first quarter of 2023 the Northern Gulf Coast of Florida Leon County has a hotter average temperature than the previous 4 years Weather station analysis shows that Leon County Florida has received the most precipitation by 50 over other key flood zones in Florida although MiamiDade county has had the most flood events year to date Insights driven by regression analysis demonstrate that major storm events 100year 50year and 25year impact zones for built up areas and will continue to increase over the next 5 years as 10year impact zones stabilize thus identifying that major storm event activity will continue to grow in size and impact on the surrounding areas of typical flood events Although Leon and MiamiDade counties are seeing the largest impact respectively due to increased precipitation and flood events Lee County has the highest average damage in dollars per event due to hurricane activity Here is the link to Domos Show Floor Showdown video Incorta Here is the link to Incortas Show Floor Showdown video LTIMindtree Lumin picked up the South Asia Region for the river flooding analysis Some of their key insights include India has seen the highest population more than 40 million impacted by river flooding in the last five years This river flooding has been caused by severe land precipitation but has been exacerbated by growth in dry grassland cover and artificial surface cover at the cost of vegetative cover A quick simulation revealed that continued urbanization in India would lead to another 6500 square kilometers of land area being exposed to floods in a five year horizon A statewise deep dive uncovered the densely populated West Bengal and Bihar as the most affected regions with 17 million people exposed to floods in Bihar There is however a cause for optimism as the trend of flood mortality or the casualties from flooding events has decreased steadily Densely and moderately populated regions in India have seen a significant drop in flood mortality  This decrease in casualties is driven by drop in the number of flooding events and the number of days of flooding but the number of people displaced due to flooding in India continues to remain fairly high each year causing massive social and economic upheaval Here is the link to LTI Mindtrees Show Floor Showdown video SAP Analytics Cloud Key Findings River Flood has more impact on Population and Economics The only exception is in the Netherlands where Coastal Flood is a significant problem Population at Risk Cropland at Risk and Total Land at Risk all have a linear relationship with Population Cropland and Land in a country Due to this the largest and most populated countries suffer more typically found in Asia The most suffering countries are at the same time largest Agriculture producers with a high share of Agriculture in their GDS Therefore flooding is not only dangerous for people and infrastructure but also has a large economic effect especially affecting food supply through Agriculture Countries with a high GDP per capita are in the safest positions regarding flood while low GDP per capita countries are strongly affected by floods

Key Findings After analyzing global disasters across the past 30 years to understand the impact of floods vs other natural disasters we discovered that from 1990 to 1991 there were a lot of land and mud slides in eastern Asia that led to a 388 increase in total affected population due to floods caused by heavy rains Put simply indirect floodrelated disasters have proven devastating to human life

found that the most recent dollar claim value impact occurring in Ida Oklahoma Here is the link to Telliuss Show Floor Showdown video Data Science and Machine Learning Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Aible Key Findings Predicting floods is not as actionable as focusing our resources on trying to address floods that affect at least 100 people Such a specific goal enabled a far more useful analysis We need to balance multiple KPI such as lives affected vs economic impact of the floods as well as stay within relevant budgets We need to consider fairness For example if we stayed within current budgets and only focused on the economic impact of floods we would underinvest in underdeveloped regions This would be contrary to the goals of a hypothetical UN agency By trying out different definitions of fairness we can balance our fairness goals against economic ones A manual process cannot possibly consider so many different constraints but an AIfirst businessoutcomedriven approach conducts such analysis in minutes Here is the link to Aibles Show Floor Showdown video eQ Technologic Key Findings Cropland exposure and Builtup area exposure related parameters play a major role is deciding the flood predictions As for USA maximum floods have occurred in Quarter2 The highest cause of floods remains heavy rains and torrential rains It is observed that Texas has maximum floods in the last 5 years and they have been successful in reducing the damage due to floods in last 3 years Arizona has also reduced the damage and fatalities caused due to floods in the last 3 years Across the world it is observed that cropland exposure to river floods have gone down over the years Similarly buildup area exposure to coastal floods has also gone down

platforms Cloudera Hybrid analytics and transaction functions can coexist on the same data management platformbut require different storage processing memory and channels management from each other This reinforces the demand for workload management and separate optimization techniques Orchestration is the key to data management across intercloud multicloud and hybrid onpremises systems Pervasive and persistent monitoring of use cases can result in automation of patternbased or repetitive tasks Patternbasis can also consist of gradual drift and shift of workload patterns and this can be built into a predictive efficiency model Metadata management goes beyond technical metadata and even combining that with business metadata when it infers or anticipates new users of recently introduced data assets Effectively the pull analytics data search can be converted into a push and verify model in which new data is pushed to existing use cases Cloudera comes from being built for the cloud era Here

verifyErrors   message   verifyErrors   verifyErrors  Something went wrong Please try again later  verifyErrors  Doctors in Rajasthan have hit the streets in protest after the state became the first in the country to pass legislation guaranteeing the right to health claiming it will put an unsustainable burden on private healthcare providers Private sector doctors have been protesting for more than 10 days across the state after the Right to Health Act was passed in the state assembly last month demanding a rollback of the law that makes access to healthcare a legal entitlement for every citizen of the state The Rajasthan government also provides health insurance coverage of 25m rupees approx 25000 per annum for a family that covers more than 1500 procedures as well as free diagnostic tests at government centres under welfare schemes Dr Abhay Shukla national coconvenor of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan network of nonprofits working in the healthcare sector in India described the new law as a major step forward This is the first time a state government has laid down in a comprehensive way the right to healthcare he said to The Independent However protests have continued against the Congresss Ashok Gehlotled state government and in a massive show of strength on Monday thousands of doctors took to the streets in the capital Jaipur pressing for their demands On Wednesday medical services were crippled in the northern state as government doctors joined the agitation against the law in a oneday strike reported the Press Trust of India Emergency services were however exempted from the strike Speaking to The Independent Dr Amit Yadav former president of the Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors explained their opposition to the new law This law has many provisions that are not in favour of both doctors and patients It only seeks to hamper the relationship between the doctors and patients and puts a financial burden on doctors Private doctors resident doctors are all protesting and will continue to protest till our demands are met The Indian Medical Association IMA the countrys largest association of medical workers has also announced its support for the protests On Tuesday the body called for a Black Day to be observed by all members in solidarity with the protesting doctors in Rajasthan and urged the state government to engage in dialogue The law passed on 21 March by the state assembly gives every Rajasthan resident the right to avail free OPD outpatient department services IPD inpatient department services consultation drugs diagnostics emergency transport procedure and emergency care as provided by all public health institutions accordantly to their level of healthcare The legislation was first introduced in the state assembly in September but was sent to a select committee It was subsequently amended after the select committees report The law also says that all citizens in the state will have the right to emergency treatment and care without prepayment of requisite fee or charges at any healthcare facility including private providers It is this clause regarding emergency healthcare services without any prepayment that has become the main bone of contention between the state government and the doctors The law describes an emergency as accidental emergency emergency due to snake biteanimal bite and any other emergency decided by State Health Authority under prescribed emergency circumstances Dr Sharad Kumar Agarwal president of the IMA said that the law is draconian and puts the onus on private doctors to fulfill the governments welfare responsibilities This is a bill brought as a populist measure by the government because the elections are around the corner The state is slated to go to the polls this year After objections from doctors the law passed by the assembly featured several changes including defining an emergency as well as the healthcare institutions that are required to provide such services without any prepayment The earlier version of the law stated that such emergency treatment and care will be provided by any health care provider establishment or facility including private provider establishment or facility but the amended law states that such services will be provided by public health institution health care establishment and designated health care centres qualified to provide such care or treatment accordantly to their level of health care promptly as prescribed or as per guidelines Dr Yadav said that if the emergencies included only the three defined ones doctors would not be agitating If it is only these three emergencies then there is no problem  but this is still the emergency defined by state health authorities which is not at all clear he says Dr Agarwal added that despite the changes and the definition of emergency stated in the law there remains ambiguity For a patient even a simple headache is an emergency but for doctors things that endanger life is an emergency What if a cardiac arrest patient goes to an ophthalmologist The public wont know the difference because the government is publicising that you can go to any doctor and then that doctor will refer you to another doctor if need be There will be loss of time and there can be loss of life The government is saying that the doctors will have to pay for transportation for such patients in case of such emergency referrals But how will this happen Not every doctor has an ambulance According to the law if patients do not pay the requisite charges after being provided proper emergency care stabilisation and transfer the healthcare provider shall be entitled to receive requisite fee and charges or proper reimbursement from state government in prescribed manner as the case may be Dr Agarwal says that the government is silent on the transportation fee that will be incurred by private doctors If the patient doesnt pay who will pay Doctors say that the process of reimbursement is also not clear They are saying that it will be reimbursed but how will this be done is not mentioned anywhere said Dr Yadav Public health experts however say that while some ambiguity has been left in the law it is an important step to standardise delivery of public healthcare across the state The kind of opposition we are seeing from the private sector is surprising because 95 per cent of the bill relates to the public sector says Dr Shukla who was also one of the people involved in the initial stages of drafting the bill The only section that concerns the private sector is the emergency provisions Due to the repeated modifications requested by the private sector and in order to address their concerns some sections in this regard have been drafted in a hurry that leaves some scope of ambiguity According to Dr Shukla even in the case of the emergency provision it is clearly stated that the government will provide reimbursement The law also clearly mentions designated facilities will be required to provide care as per their level of qualification So it is not that an ophthalmic hospital will be asked to give cardiac care He added that if private doctors have an issue with these sections they can be confirmed once the rules of the act are notified This can be clarified in the rules and guidelines in a manner in which there is no inappropriate expectation from private hospitals to provide emergency care which is beyond their capacity And those who have issues can make them known at that stage But what is happening now is making a mountain out of molehill he said Amid the ongoing protests the Rajasthan government has said that the legislation will not be withdrawn at any cost If there is any problem with the bill then we are ready to hold a discussion but the bill wont be taken back At any cost we will not take back the bill state health minister Prasadi Lal Meena said to news agency ANI After a lot of discussions the Right to Health bill was brought by our government People of the state are benefiting from it We held discussions and abided by all demands of protesting doctors CM has appealed to them to come back to work They are taking undue advantage he added Although protests have continued doctors say that they are ready to hold discussions if the government invites them for talks We dont want to sit on the roads and protest says Dr Agarwal Call the doctors talk to them Why is the government hesitant in doing so If there is any further consultation invitation we will go he said Despite the stalemate experts say that the law places an obligation on the state to provide a certain level of standardised public healthcare to mariginalised areas Areawise Rajasthan is the largest Indian state with many desert and subrural areas where healthcare delivery is not optimal said Dr Shukla The main positive impact will be that geographically and otherwise marginalised groups who may not have been receiving adequate care will now be able to do so The law also includes the creation of district health authorities and a state health authority which can inspect hospitals and clinics and act as grievance redressal systems in case of complaints These authorities will also formulate guidelines to implement the law and advise the government on treatment protocol In a way the state is placing upon itself a certain obligation that a certain level of public health services will be delivered across the state so this is definitely a very positive provision said Dr Shukla,Doctors in the Indian state of Rajasthan have hit the streets in protest against the government's decision not to renew their contracts.,entertainment

women filmmakers across the world and presenting a critical perspective of what feminist cinema has to offer In presenting a vast heterogeneity the book leaves an open question as to what

and those in Africa Asia and Latin America with a Third Cinema lineage and an anticolonial lens notes reviewer Sanoja Bhaumik This division is certainly too simplistic  complicated by diasporic

premiere of their musical Disco Dancer that had found much appreciation in London last year In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol Salim Merchant 49 one half of the musical duo speak about the musical the challenges of recreating the eponymous Mithun Chakrabortystarrer 1982 blockbuster film for the stage and about launching a devotionalmusic channel that will feature all faiths Edited excerpts SalimSulaimans Disco Dancer stage musical in London Your new musical will be premiering in Mumbai this month but musicals arent a new zone for you We launched the musical Disco Dancer last year in London it did really well there and we are doing it in Mumbai from April 10 onwards at the NSCI Dome in Worli Our first musical was Beyond Bollywood which was 10 years ago It did exceptionally well in London Europe the UAE and at the Kingdom of Dreams Gurugram We then did Umrao Jaan in 2019 And again we did a very successful run of it in London in January 2020 Following this COVID stalled everything and we will be relaunching the Umrao Jaan musical very soon Thats our next project The 1980s movie Disco Dancer was a superhit why did you choose this for a musical how are you going about presenting it on stage Mithun das Mithun Chakraborty Disco Dancer was the most epic film In those days in the 80s it was one of the first few films to have crossed Rs 100 crore earnings back then We love the film and whenever we see it we are transported to that era I have seen it three times as a child I was a kid when it released and can never forget it because I used to watch Mithin das steps and was so much in awe of that music And Bappi das late Bappi Lahiris compositions were super hits I Am A Disco Dancer written by Anjaan sung by Vijay Benedict Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Parvati Khan Koi Yahan Nache Nache by Faruk Kaiser and sung by Bappi da and Usha Uthup Ae Oh Aa Zara Mudke written by Anjaan and sung by Kishore Kumar Yaad Aa Raha Hai Anjaans words and Bappi das voice Krishna Dharti Pe Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Nandu Bhende Goron Ki Na Kalon Ki two versions written by Anjaan and sung by Suresh Wadkar and Usha Mangeshkar So many hits in one single film single album It was a rare project when all songs did so well nationally  combined with Bappi das iconic music Mithun das dance and acting and Babbar Subhashs direction We wanted to bring that alive as a musical on stage To recreate a classic isnt easy especially so if you are using a different platform  a film to a stage musical How much of this was a challenge It is a huge challenge of course because obviously the film had a lot of layers about the mother the struggle of a poor boy growing up to become a mega star and then after his mothers demise he takes revenge there is a lot of subtext for this musical There are many good messages of belief determination love for your parents love for your art and of course there is a romantic love story in it also It was a huge challenge to recreate historic legendary songs of Bappi da and then bring it on to the stage We also had to compose two fresh original songs especially for this musical And since it is set in the 80s we relived the entire era with costumes dancing and dialogues It was quite the challenge Disco Dancer musical in London Tell us about the cast Are all the actors also singers Yes Arjun Talwar plays the role of Jimmy Tia Kar is the female lead She was an Indian Idol contestant from 2012 whom I have known closely because I was a judge for that season All the singing is live and music is partly recorded and partly live Of course there is amazing choreography directed by Rajiv Goswami He has done incredible work He directed Umrao Jaan Beyond Bollywood and this is his third with us Irfan Siddiqui is the lyricist and has written for a lot of the movies Im composing for including Fashion 2008 Iqbal 2005 Kurbaan 2009 He has also written the new song that we have composed for this particular show and also the dialogues Saregama India Ltd is producing it and Suniel Shetty who is a huge fan of Bappi da and Mithun da is presenting it Bappi da passed away last year Did he know about this musical What was the first reaction to this When I last spoke to Bappi da in 2019 about our intention of redoing the iconic film as a musical for the stage he was extremely happy It was my dream that Bappi da could come for the premier He gave us his blessings all throughout the making of the musical Its really unfortunate that we lost him last year Arjun Talwar as Jimmy in Disco Dancer stage musical in London You recently launched a devotional channel Tell us about that My label is doing very well so I am extremely happy with that We are releasing many new songs focussing on festivals and recently we started a new devotional channel with the beginning of Ramzan On this we will be releasing devotional music from various faiths right from bhajans Sufi qawwalis aarti stutis shlokas mantras We released the Ramadan Mubarak track then on Ram Navami which is also considered Sai Babas birthday we released a Sai bhajan Japu Sai Naam We will be releasing the Hanuman Chalisa this week and a very popular aarti Om Jai Jagadish Hare We are going to be releasing almost 3040 devotional pieces this year Apart from that our Merchant Records channel is also doing very well We used to do three to four songs in a month now we are doing eight songs in one month,All images are copyrighted.,business

Vals Switzerland has several hot springs and has the added advantage of spectacular scenery that inevitably showcases rolling meadows alpine flowers and snowcapped mountains Both Bad Ragaz and Rigi Kaltbad fit perfectly into this description But for a slightly offbeat experience Vals in Graubnden is ideal Located at the edge of a tiny village filled with pretty halftimbered houses and a brook of electric blue water flowing through 7132 Therme is an unusual destination The thermal springs here have been known since the Bronze Age around 2000 BC to 700 BC but it is only in the last three decades that it is has undergone a transformation What makes it special and an architectural wonder is that the series of sprawling baths have been crafted from the dense green mountain quartz giving

different kinds of pools both indoor and outdoor whose temperature ranges from 30 degrees Celsius to 36 degrees Celsius It is especially relaxing and fun to float around on the outdoor pool with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains some of which have snow on the peaks even in summer The changing scenery is also something that captivates through the summer  lush green slopes with colourful flowers turn to beautiful golden yellow and orange in autumn and then wear a cloak of white during winter once the snow begins to fall Apart from the various pools there are several kinds of baths including steam baths In addition there are also several treatments like Swedish massages restorative and detoxifying rituals and other treatments Pamukkale Turkey In Turkeys Pamukkale National

representen una imagen de una morada secreta protegida de la vista nada podra estar ms lejos de la verdad Porque esta es una casa que no trata de mimetizarse quiere sobresalir del resto llamar la atencin y captar esas miradas de la calle declaran los arquitectos Aslam Karadan y Sham Salim del estudio homnimo AslamSham Architects con sede en Kozhikode Es absolutamente nico con su forma y tiene la intencin de capturar la intriga de los transentes tal como el cliente quera La parte oculta del apodo explican proviene de la escala disfrazada de la casa una casa de tres niveles que crea la ilusin de ser una estructura ms pequea de dos pisos Clientes  Ajmal y Sabna una pareja joven de unos 30 aos Ajmal es un emprendedor que se hizo a s mismo y es cofundador de Eduwizz una startup de tecnologa educativa repartida por todo Kerala Sabna tambin es parte de la misma compaa Aunque los principales clientes son Ajmal Sabna y sus dos nias los padres de Ajmal y sus dos hermanos menores tambin son ocupantes de la casa El resumen funcional era bastante estndar y sencillo es decir queran una casa de 5 BHK con una habitacin adicional para usar como cine en casa piscina y otras comodidades estndar Sin embargo el resumen esttico es algo que a nosotros como arquitectos nos encant y encontramos desafiante al mismo tiempo El cliente como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario exitoso hecho a s mismo y quera construir una casa que hiciera una declaracin desde el primer vistazo pero que al mismo tiempo no comprometiera demasiado las funcionalidades Nos dieron la tarea de idear algo que estuviera fuera de la caja pero que no fuera completamente experimental Este resumen combinado con la naturaleza altamente contorneada del sitio que se inclinaba hacia abajo abruptamente desde el frente del sitio hacia la parte trasera es lo que condujo a la formafachada bastante nica del edificio y su nombre la Casa Oculta La escala de la casa permanece en gran medida oculta para un espectador desde la calle pero al mismo tiempo se destaca con su forma atpica y crea esa curiosidad en sus mentes por saber qu hay detrs de esa formafachada frontal peculiar En cuanto a la configuracin espacial la zonificacin bsica se ha realizado en funcin de la proximidad con la va que bordea el frente del solar La primera zona es la zona pblica que tiene visibilidad desde la calle y alberga el asiento delantero as como el espacio de vida formal que est destinado principalmente a los visitantesinvitados Luego viene la siguiente zona que es la zona semipblica que es el centro de actividad central y lo que nos gustara llamar como el alma de la casa que tiene el estanque Koi iluminado alrededor del cual se planifican todos los espacios de actividad central de la casa a saber la sala de estar familiar el comedor y la cocina Y luego viene la zona privada que alberga las habitaciones el cine en casa y la piscina que se coloca en la parte trasera del sitio y por lo tanto est completamente aislada de los extraos Adems con respecto a la configuracin espacial debe comprender que esto no se hace en un sitio plano este es un sitio muy contorneado por lo que tambin podramos lograr esta diferenciacin de zonificacin con los niveles Sin embargo desde el dormitorio principal se abre un balcn hacia el frente de la casa que era un requisito del cliente que necesitaba ver desde la entrada principal al sitio desde el dormitorio principal La parcela en forma de L tiene una parte que sobresale hacia el exterior en la parte trasera esta parte es la que se utiliza para acomodar el garaje El camino de entrada y las reas del garaje cuentan con paisajismo mientras que se proporciona ms paisajismo verde en el patio delantero La parte ms desafiante as como la ms emocionante de este proyecto fue definitivamente el proceso de manipular este sitio altamente contorneado para tener una casa con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intentaba reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da normal Esto se ha logrado dividiendo diferentes zonas en mltiples niveles La entrada principal a la casa est en la zona pblica que est a un nivel de solo un par de pasos desde el nivel del suelo que se aproxima en el frente el que est entre las paredes de granito macizo en el frente que juega con el sentido de escala a un visitante Este nivel tiene la sala de estar formal as como la sala de oracin nombres las cuales estn destinadas principalmente a los visitantes La entrada secundaria la entrada lateral en arco es la ms destinada a la familia ya que accede al ncleo de actividad principal de la casa con un solo paso Solo necesita bajar un paso desde ese nivel para llegar a la zona semipblica que alberga el estanque Koi el espacio de vida familiar el comedor y la cocina Es desde este nivel que se accede a los bloques de dormitorios mltiples que se distribuyen en tres niveles Entonces desde el nivel del rea comn es solo medio piso de ascenso y descenso a los 2 niveles que tienen 2 dormitorios cada uno El dormitorio principal y el cine en casa se encuentran en el nivel ms alto con un espacio de estudio y una terraza de servicio en un nivel medio entre estos dos niveles Por lo tanto la casa en total se divide en 67 niveles para adaptarse a todos los requisitos espaciales de los clientes sin alterar demasiado los niveles del sitio existente Tambin hay acceso terciario a la casa desde el nivel ms bajo que es el mismo que el nivel de la piscina el camino de acceso de la se extiende hacia la parte trasera del sitio y hay un porche desde el que se puede acceder a la casa y hay dos dormitorios tambin a este nivel Se puede acceder a este nivel a travs de una rampa y los 2 dormitorios aqu con acceso para automviles aseguran que la casa sea fcilmente accesible para las personas mayores y las personas con capacidades diferentes El ascensor se ha construido en la casa y por lo tanto siempre existe la posibilidad de agregar un ascensor ms adelante para acceder a todos los niveles cmodamente La paleta de materiales y colores se ha decidido principalmente para dar a la casa un carcter muy simple pero sofisticado Aparte de los blancos las texturas naturales de la mampostera de escombros al azar la madera los pisos de piedra natural con acabado de mltiples texturas como el granito las piedras de Kota la madera de la plataforma etc se eligieron para dar carcter a cada espacio y diferenciarlos visualmente sin comprometer la sensacin abierta de el espacio Los acentos verdes en toda la casa con macetas tambin ayudan a crear una sensacin clida y acogedora para el usuario Nos gusta exponer el verdadero carcter de los materiales en lugar de imitarlos en otra cosa y por lo tanto las losas de techo de hormign y los muros de contencin tienen texturas de hormign sin embargo es un acabado de hormign ms pulido para los interiores mientras que es un tono ms spero para el exterior La estrategia de iluminacin es algo fundamental para todos nuestros diseos diseamos para la mxima iluminacin natural durante todo el da lo que creemos que crea un bienestar mental para el usuario de manera subconsciente Idealmente queremos que las luces artificiales se usen solo una vez que se pone el sol Las duras luces del este y el oeste estn bloqueadas para que no caigan directamente en la casa y se toman de manera difusa a travs de pantallas con persianas fuera de las ventanas Por la noche se proporciona una iluminacin ambiental sutil en los interiores que brindan una comodidad ptima al usuario Sin embargo a los exteriores se les da una iluminacin un poco ms dramtica para que la estructura se destaque para un espectador desde la calle que era algo que el cliente deseaba Para ser honesto no podramos haber encontrado un cliente ms complaciente que estos dos ya que quedaron completamente cautivados por el concepto se los presentamos y apenas les pedimos cambios salvo los ajustes menores en el interior Este proyecto es uno de los ejemplos perfectos de cunto se puede elevar el producto final cuando los arquitectos y los clientes estn sincronizados Entonces fue ms como un sueo que todos vimos juntos Sera extremadamente difcil elegir un lugar como el favorito pero si tuviramos que elegir uno sera el ncleo de actividad principal de la casa que alberga todos los espacios comunes alrededor del estanque Koi iluminado por el cielo La terraza al aire libre desde el comedor que da al rea de la piscina es otro de los favoritos El cliente que como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario y pasa la mayor parte del tiempo en su propia casa ya que su trabajo se realiza en lnea nos dice que le encanta pasar tiempo en esta casa y que sigue encontrando nuevos lugares y siente cada espacio con cada pasar el da en la medida en que odia cuando tiene que irse para reuniones relacionadas con el trabajo de vez en cuando La mayora de los muebles se personalizan segn el espacio y el tema de diseo de la casa salvo algunos muebles sueltos y otros con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intenta reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da normal,  800-361-3020

testing with the AASM 1000 guided bomb Photo DGA The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now  5309 chars,The new standard brings major capability upgrades which pave the way for collaborative air combat The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now ready for fielding While the announcement was released just few days ago the qualification arrived on March 13 2023 shortly after the first aircraft in the new configuration was delivered to the Base Arienne 118 at MontdeMarsan The first plane we received is one of the F3Rs that we sent to the Flight Test Center of the Directorate General of Armaments in Istres for their software transformation explains Lieutenant Colonel Guillaume second in command of the Fighter and Experimentation Squadron ECE Other brand new aircraft will come directly from the Dassault production lines and will complete the fleet of fighters sent gradually to Istres for their transition from the F3R standard to the F41 The first Rafale F41 has been assigned to the Centre dExpertise Arienne Militaire Military Air Expertise Center followed by a second aircraft a week later where it immediately started operational testing the day after the delivery As mentioned by Lt Col Guillaume the DGA confirmed all the Rafales of the Air and Space Force and the French Navy will be gradually retrofitted to this new standard Dassault also resumed the deliveries of new Rafales to French military after a fouryear interruption The development of the Rafale F4 standard started in early 2019 when the contract for the new upgrade was notified by the Ministry of Defense soon after the certification of the F3R standard This standard is based on four pillars connectivity engagement availability and the detection and fight against threats said the Minister of the Armed Forces in that occasion This F4 standard is a technological leap an industrial leap a strategic leap According to the DGA improving the connectivity of the Rafale and the associated networked employment methods both in a national and allied context is the primary goal of the F4 standard The new standard will be the first step towards the networked multiplatform capabilities of the future Systme de Combat Arien Futur SCAF The F4 standard will include upgrades of existing capabilities like the Thales RBE2 Active Electronically Scanned Array AESA radar the Spectra Systme de Protection et dvitement des Conduites de Tir du Rafale or in English SelfProtection Equipment Countering Threats to Rafale Aircraft electronic warfare system the OSF Optronique secteur frontal frontal sector optronics the InfraRed Search and Track IRST the Thales Talios targeting pod the Reco NG reconnaissance pod and the communications suite However there will also be important new capabilities like the Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display HMD the MICA NG NextGeneration airtoair missile and the new 1000 kg variant of the Safran AASM Armement AirSol Modulaire Hammer PrecisionGuided Munition PGM Many of the new capabilities have been extensively tested during a test campaign in 2021 where two Rafale 41 were included in largescale realistic scenarios where the crews also implemented unspecified collaborative combat functionalities to localize adversaries by passive means The HMD is a longwaited capability for the Rafale Initially the Sagem Gerfaut HMD was chosen in the early 2000s to equip the Rafale however the program was later dropped According to reports Qatar and India asked for an HMD on their aircraft so the Elbit Targo II was integrated on the Rafale France however chose to integrate the Scorpion with a first test campaign carried out in Cazaux during March 2021 preceded by parachute compatibility tests to verify that the new helmet is safe for the pilot in the event of an ejection As for the 1000 kg AASM the new variant sees the AASM kit applied on the BLU109 penetrator warhead or the standard Mk84 but also to new developments in progress from the French company ARESIA BA84 and P1000 bomb bodies according to the missions needs The first separation tests were performed in December 2020 at the DGA Flight test center in Cazaux The new AASM variant has have also a specific range increase kit to extend its standoff firing range and was certified at the end of 2022 The Rafale will be able to carry up to three of these bombs of which one under the fuselage and two under the wings similarly to the already certified GBU24 Paveway III The Talios targeting pod has also been upgraded as announced by the DGA in November 2022 with the delivery of the 31st pod which is the first of the upgraded variant Among the new capabilities the pod has a highdefinition mode which integrates a near infrared imager and a color widefield sensor expected to be fully exploited by the Rafale 42 standard and an integrated datalink Among the other modifications the DGA mentioned the evolution of passive threat detection algorithms increased data exchange capacities between Rafales greater protection against cyber threats and improvements in fire control for the use of the Meteor missile with the missile managed by an aircraft other than the firing aircraft The Meteor missile was introduced with the F3R standard and became operational in 2021 intended to be used in conjunction with the MICA EM for long range engagements,The French defence ministry has announced that the new standard for the Rafale fighter jet has been qualified.,business

author of On Nixons Madness An Emotional History March 2023 Richard Nixon discusses Vietnam with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and Deputy National Security Advisor Al Haig at Camp David 1972 When H R Bob Haldeman first described Richard Nixons madman theory in his 1978 memoir The Ends of Power few scholars paid serious attention For those who did notice the oneparagraph description of Nixons riskladen strategy sounded like Haldeman was taking a cheap shot calling his old boss crazy After all Nixon had seen his chief of staff resign and serve time for the Watergate coverup The madman theory Haldeman wrote was a phrasewhich Im sure will bring smiles of delight to Nixonhaters everywhere Nearly half a century later scholars have established that the rash ruse was central to Nixons strategy to fight the Cold War The madman theory can also tell us a good deal about the famously elusive expresident himself how Nixon saw his career as he saw the superpower struggle how life for Nixon proved to be laden with exhilarating risk peril and a series of tests of will against determined foes According to Haldeman Nixon promised that he could end the Vietnam War by intimidating the North Vietnamese with seemingly reckless abandon I want the North Vietnamese to believe Ive reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war Nixon reportedly told his top aide He would play a kind of latterday ogre in the presidents words obsessed angry not able to be restrained As his national security advisor Henry Kissinger remarked Nixons strategy resembled a poker game in which he pushed so many chips into the pot that the United States foes would think the president had gone crazy Nixon liked to concoct names for such gambits He called this one the madman theory Yet the ploy pivoted on the idea that he did not consider himself to be mad He considered himself crafty It was not that he was suicidal but that he would act as if he were willing to risk joint nuclear annihilation The trick of the madman theory was how difficult it was for observers to decipher whether he would act on his threats for allout war or if he were simply pretending The more elusive the distinction the more effective the bluff The better the actor the crazier he seemed and if not firstrate Nixon was a perpetual performer Throughout his career he transformed from Redbaiter to Average Joe to worldly diplomat to crafty pol to elder statesman Haldeman called Nixon the Man of Many Facets The part of the bullying ogre was another role to play In the fall of 1969 Nixon enacted the madman theory threatening the North Vietnamese with abandon B52s loaded with nuclear weapons circling the Arctic aircraft carriers deployed to the Pacific a feint that pantomimed laying mines at the major North Vietnamese port of Haiphong Nixon believed he could scare Hanoi into peace he couldnt and he didnt The communists refused to back down and the war ground on and on Nixons faith in the madman theory did not however abate The historians William Burr and Jeffrey P Kimball the most notable scholars of the madman theory have written of how Nixon continued to adopt the strategy threatening nuclear intervention during a civil war in Jordan a crisis between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a bloody struggle between India and Pakistan Although it didnt fool the North Vietnamese the madman theory did work to a degree in Moscow As the Soviet Foreign Minister worried Nixon put forces on alert so often that it is hard to know what it meant Rather than a steady march toward dtente Nixon approached the Cold War as a series of emergencies demanding offthecuff often rash decisionmaking He looked at the superpower standoff and its proxy wars as a set of conflicts lurching from one crisis to the next from Latin America to Europe from the Middle East to South Asia to the Pacific Whether elated or aggravated Nixon returned spiritedly to the coercive ruse of the madman theory which reflected not only his predilection for acting and for secrecy but also his penchant for taking great gambles in pursuit of evergreater gains Nixon likewise envisioned himself as ever in the spotlight He saw his life as ever a fight to fend off fierce rivals as ever on the verge of great victory or collapse as ever a series of tests demanding great political gambles and allout assaults The madman theory tested his striving and determination and his skills as a performer It was another version of the story he told of himself of the lonely bootstrapped Dick Nixon risking everything as he reeled from crisis to crisis struggling gambling breakneck against a dangerous and threatening world And With no political experience not even owning a suit with only 10000 in the bank his wife Pat pregnant Nixon had taken a longshot chance at running for Congress in 1946 Four years later he ran for Senate with terrible odds against the muchbeloved Democrat incumbent and onetime move star Helen GahaganDouglas He continued to risk take risks in his political career in order to climb quickly precociously running for the vice presidency under Dwight Eisenhower at age 39 Two years after his defeat to John Kennedy for the 1960 presidency a 49yearold Nixon described his life not only as a set of gambles but as a pattern of excruciating public tests against powerful enemies looking to destroy him He titled his first biography Six Crises to describe his professional ascent He wrote of standing up valiantly to communists in the State Department during the House UnAmerican Activities Committee hearings He wrote of how he had been publicly castigated by Democrats for keeping a secret campaign fund that he maintained only defrayed costs for constituent mail and secretaries He recounted how his limousine had been attacked by leftist rioters on a diplomatic trip to Caracas Venezuela He described his showdown with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on an American kitchen display in the heart of Moscow Nixon wrote consistently of exhilaration and fright in the face of these public standoffs It was a circular telling He was ever acting the actor taking on the role of the performer prosecutor debater ambassador As he railed I have contempt for men who wont take chances I call them gutless wonders He maligned the press the counterculture antiwar protestors the naysayers those on the sidelines who played it safe They were not doers they were the feeble critics sickly Action and risk for Nixon were to be cherished As for the man in the arena willing to take chances he quoted Theodore Roosevelt If he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat The fundamental aspect of the madman theory Nixon told Haldeman was that he alone could play the part The communists Nixon insisted would believe any threat of force that Nixon makes because its Nixon Indeed the madman theory seemed a caricature of the famously frustrated politician It was he who baited the Reds furiously It was he who would not be kicked around anymore He who would not be contained He who could transform from new Nixon to new Nixon He insisted to Haldeman that the foremost reason that the madman strategy would work was his mad guise It was his reputation and his ability to act The strategic theory the crazed bluffery like a glove fit the man temper and control risk and performance The nuclear ruse would work Nixon proposed because its Nixon,Richard Nixon

School de la Universidad de Pennsylvania Trabaj 26 aos en el Citigroup en distintos pases incluyendo la Argentina Uruguay y Japn donde fue CEO Actualmente es el presidente y CEO de la calificadora SP Douglas Peterson tiene ms de 30 aos de experiencia en el mercado financiero internacional Trabaj durante dos dcadas para el Citi desde varios pases entre ellos la Argentina estuvo entre 1986 y 1988 Tambin estuvo en Japn como CEO del Citi en 2004 Desde 2011 trabaja en la calificadora de riesgo SP y desde 2013 es su presidente y CEO Peterson visita nuestro pas dos o tres veces al ao No solo por su trabajo sino tambin porque est casado con una argentina Normalmente vamos a Buenos Aires para fin de ao y despus hacemos una semana de turismo El lugar que ms me sorprendi fue el Lago Argentino y el glaciar Perito Moreno Hemos ido a Bariloche y a la Pennsula Valds dice en una entrevista con LA NACION hecha en Houston en el marco de la CERAWeek by SP Global Segn el ltimo informe de SP Global las fuertes turbulencias recientes en los mercados financieros interrumpieron una desaceleracin que se evaluaba como relativamente ordenada y necesaria de la economa occidental El impacto macro parece limitado por ahora La respuesta poltica fue contundente en Estados Unidos y Europa y los mercados se han calmado pero siguen nerviosos Nuestro pronstico y narrativa de referencia se mantienen prcticamente sin cambios para las economas avanzadas dice la calificadora que dirige Peterson Por otro lado proyecta que los bancos centrales seguirn subiendo las tasas en respuesta a las perspectivas macroeconmicas a pesar de las recientes turbulencias El pronstico de inflacin base y las expectativas de inflacin se mantienen por encima del objetivo para la mayora de los bancos centrales este ao y el prximo Esto implica que las condiciones financieras deben endurecerse an ms lo que a su vez requiere tasas de poltica ms altas a menos que el propio mercado haga el endurecimiento por ejemplo a travs de estndares crediticios ms estrictos Reiteramos nuestra opinin anterior de que dada la falla en el pronstico de inflacin en 2021 los bancos centrales tendern a pecar de cautelosos y se inclinarn hacia tasas ms altas y condiciones ms estrictas para llevar la inflacin de regreso a la meta Volver a quedarse atrs de la curva no sera bueno para la credibilidad indica Cmo ve este ao la economa para la Argentina y los mercados emergentes Estados Unidos tiene condiciones muy diferentes a lo normal porque hay muy bajo desempleo pero por otro lado tiene que seguir subiendo las tasas de inters dada la inflacin que para Estados Unidos est muy alta en 6 si se tiene en cuenta que viene de 10 o 12 aos de cero Habr recesin En la pandemia entre lo que el Gobierno le dio a la gente y a los negocios en subsidios muchos se quedaron en sus casas mirando televisin sin hacer nada sin viajar Por lo tanto hoy hay una gran capacidad de inversin y de gasto que todava no se ha terminado Hay gente gastando en viajes en ropa nueva en salidas a comer en remodelacin de sus casas Hay una gran demanda por eso no se ve todava la recesin Por otro lado los restaurantes y hoteles no tienen la cantidad de empleados suficientes para sus negocios Les falta gente Por eso no vemos recesin sigue el gasto muy alto de los consumidores y el desempleo est muy bajo Sin embargo hay una preocupacin de que eso pueda cambiar S porque la Reserva Federal est subiendo la tasa de inters y la teora dice que cuando se llega a un cierto nmero ser muy caro pedir un prstamo y eso llevar a una recesin Todo al rea de vivienda y construccin se volver muy caro y la economa empezar a caer Esa es la teora En un pas como la Argentina si la economa marcha bien el consumo crece y el desempleo es bajo el gobierno pedira no tocar nada no subir la tasa de inters Por qu pese a que la economa crece los bancos centrales estn dispuestos a desacelerar la economa para bajar la inflacin La inflacin es un impuesto a la gente ms pobre La aceleracin de precios es ms alta en combustibles alquileres y comida de entre 8 y 10 interanual por arriba del 6 de inflacin promedio en Estados Unidos Una persona que come paga el alquiler y usa el auto para ir al trabajo tiene una inflacin de 10 Los otros componentes de la inflacin como el celular o el enchufe no suben tienen una tasa de 1 o 2 interanual As que la gente con ms recursos no tiene tanta inflacin como la ms pobre Tener inflacin muy alta es un impuesto social En este momento en Estados Unidos la Fed tiene dos propsitos que el desempleo se mantenga bajo y que la inflacin baje a 2 anual Ese es su mandato Pero los polticos podran temer que si enfran la economa no los van a votar ms S pero por otro lado los polticos gobiernan a los ciudadanos cuyos gastos suben ms que sus salarios El precio de los huevos por ejemplo se duplic y es un alimento que comen mucho las personas con menores ingresos Lo mismo con la nafta la carne o ir a McDonalds Todo subi mucho entre 30 y 40 en los ltimos tres aos y los salarios no han subido As que hay mucha presin sobre los polticos por la inflacin Los polticos podran decir que la inflacin no es culpa de ellos Pero el pueblo va a decir que es culpa del gobierno porque puso demasiada moneda en circulacin En el corto plazo es un costo poltico bajar la inflacin Lo que pasa es que no hemos tenido inflacin desde los aos 70 Es casi un experimento ver cmo bajar la inflacin Lo que quieren hacer es poner el hilo a travs de la aguja Es muy difcil porque quieren subir la tasa de inters a cierto nivel y que baje un poco la actividad pero no tanto para que no haya problemas con el desempleo y con el crecimiento Es muy difcil es como una ciruga Por qu cree que la Argentina nunca logr resolver su problema de inflacin Yo no soy economista as que no quiero decir que soy un experto Pero la Argentina tuvo inflacin desde hace muchos aos por su dficit fiscal En este momento y durante muchos aos para poder pagar los gastos del Gobierno y los subsidios estuvo imprimiendo billetes Douglas Peterson La tecnologa es un tema global la Argentina tiene muy buenos tcnicos e ingenieros que pueden trabajar desde el pas archivo Estados Unidos tambin tienen dficit fiscal hace aos Pero no es tan grande Adems Estados Unidos tiene el dlar como moneda de reserva Eso quiere decir que siempre habr compra de dlares a nivel mundial porque se usa para todas las transacciones internacionales Eso le da cierta fuerza Tambin tiene un dficit sostenible hasta ahora El dficit de los ltimos aos fue mucho ms alto por eso tambin tenemos inflacin ahora porque en la pandemia hubo unos gastos muy altos para mantener la economa La actividad baj como 20 de golpe cuando todo el mundo se qued en la casa y por eso subi mucho el dficit Ahora tienen que buscar la manera de bajar el dficit Este aumento de tasas de inters cmo impactar en los mercados emergentes Est impactando Un pas que se financia en dlares y no hablo del caso puntual de la Argentina como subi el costo del dlar si importa comida y energa en este momento todo eso aument Ciertos pases como Sri Lanka que importan todo estn empezando a tener una crisis financiera La Argentina por suerte tiene comida y energa que son reas estratgicas muy fuertes son oportunidades Pero tiene dficit fiscal y el problema de la moneda Qu es lo que ms temen los inversores de la Argentina Nosotros tenemos una oficina muy exitosa en la Argentina as que depende un poco de lo que est buscando la empresa o el individuo Por supuesto en cualquier lugar del mundo cuando se invierten se buscan certezas desde el punto de vista legal de que se puede invertir y despus retirar los fondos Pero la Argentina en este momento tiene muchas oportunidades Tendra que ser el siglo de la Argentina Dnde estn las oportunidades Hay oportunidades de energa por el lado del gas y de todas las fuentes renovables minerales litio cobre La agricultura ya es muy fuerte pero con valor agregado podra ser ms fuerte an con el trigo los lcteos los limones y otros ctricos el vino Otra rea es la de servicios Nosotros tenemos una oficina en la Argentina con 400 personas desde donde exportamos servicios a clientes pero tambin los vendemos internamente Tenemos empleados argentinos sper capaces a nivel mundial Algunos se han ido del pas y estn en otros lugares El pas tambin tiene para desarrollar el turismo Es un lugar que todo el mundo quiere visitar Desde que ganamos la copa del mundo Risas Exactamente Es un pas muy atractivo para el viajero porque tiene para visitar desde la Patagonia hasta Iguaz y muchos lugares en el medio como Bariloche Mendoza la costa la ciudad de Buenos Aires Hace muchos aos escuchamos que la Argentina tiene muchas oportunidades y sin embargo pasan los aos y seguimos en una crisis que parece interminable A qu cree que se debe No soy experto en el rea poltica Creo que la Argentina necesita de liderazgo para poder hacer ese cambio y lograr su potencial Pero se nos puede pasar el tren Usted hablaba de las oportunidades en energa por ejemplo pero podemos perder el inters de los inversores No la energa es un sector donde todo el mundo est buscando oportunidades para hacer el cambio a renovables Mientras tanto vamos a necesitar gas en la transicin para pasar de carbn o petrleo a gas La Argentina tiene Vaca Muerta tiene uno de los depsitos de litio ms grandes del mundo Tiene algo de cobre no muy explorado Gas y litio hay y estos son dos elementos muy importantes para la transicin Cmo cree que seguir la guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y China Yo no lo llamo una guerra sino una tensin porque en cuanto al comercio exterior la relacin ms grande de China sigue siendo con los Estados Unidos Los dos pases se necesitan pero hay tensin por muchos lados Creo que s va a cambiar un poco el panorama para un pas como la Argentina En este momento hay dos tendencias a nivel mundial que tambin pueden favorecer a la Argentina desde el punto de vista de la relacin con Estados Unidos que son el nearshoring onshoring o friendshoring el intercambio comercial con destinos ms cercanos Hay muchas empresas que tenan muy concentrada su produccin en China y ahora buscan nuevos socios para producir Los que han aprovechado ms esa situacin son Vietnam Filipinas Tailandia e India Mxico tambin lo ha aprovechado y un pas como la Argentina tambin podra hacer uso del nearshoring Por otro lado en cuanto a la tecnologa este ser un tema muy global y la Argentina tiene muy buenos tcnicos e ingenieros que pueden trabajar

siren for lifethreatening storms in Americas heartland a new computer model that combines artificial intelligence AI and NASA satellite data could sound the alarm for dangerous space weather The model uses AI to analyze spacecraft measurements of the solar wind an unrelenting stream of material from the Sun and predict where an impending solar storm will strike anywhere on Earth with 30 minutes of advance warning This could provide just enough time to prepare for these storms and prevent severe impacts on power grids and other critical infrastructure The Sun constantly sheds solar material into space  both in a steady flow known as the solar wind and in shorter more energetic bursts from solar eruptions When this solar material strikes Earths magnetic environment its magnetosphere it sometimes creates socalled geomagnetic storms The impacts of these magnetic storms can range from mild to extreme but in a world increasingly dependent on technology their effects are growing ever more disruptive For example a destructive solar storm in 1989 caused electrical blackouts across Quebec for 12 hours plunging millions of Canadians into the dark and closing schools and businesses The most intense solar storm on record the Carrington Event in 1859 sparked fires at telegraph stations and prevented messages from being sent If the Carrington Event happened today it would have even more severe impacts such as widespread electrical disruptions persistent blackouts and interruptions to global communications Such technological chaos could cripple economies and endanger the safety and livelihoods of people worldwide In addition the risk of geomagnetic storms and devastating effects on our society is presently increasing as we approach the next solar maximum  a peak in the Suns 11year activity cycle  which is expected to arrive sometime in 2025 To help prepare an international team of researchers at the Frontier Development Lab  a publicprivate partnership that includes NASA the US Geological Survey and the US Department of Energy  have been using artificial intelligence AI to look for connections between the solar wind and geomagnetic disruptions or perturbations that cause havoc on our technology The researchers applied an AI method called deep learning which trains computers to recognize patterns based on previous examples They used this type of AI to identify relationships between solar wind measurements from heliophysics missions including ACE Wind IMP8 and Geotail and geomagnetic perturbations observed at ground stations across the planet From this they developed a computer model called DAGGER formally Deep Learning Geomagnetic Perturbation that can quickly and accurately predict geomagnetic disturbances worldwide 30 minutes before they occur According to the team the model can produce predictions in less than a second and the predictions update every minute The DAGGER team tested the model against two geomagnetic storms that happened in August 2011 and March 2015 In each case DAGGER was able to quickly and accurately forecast the storms impacts around the world Previous prediction models have used AI to produce local geomagnetic forecasts for specific locations on Earth Other models that didnt use AI have provided global predictions that werent very timely DAGGER is the first one to combine the swift analysis of AI with real measurements from space and across Earth to generate frequently updated predictions that are both prompt and precise for sites worldwide With this AI it is now possible to make rapid and accurate global predictions and inform decisions in the event of a solar storm thereby minimizing  or even preventing  devastation to modern society said Vishal Upendran of the InterUniversity Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics in India who is the lead author of a paper about the DAGGER model published in the journal Space Weather The computer code in the DAGGER model is open source and according to Upendran it could be adopted with help by power grid operators satellite controllers telecommunications companies and others to apply the predictions for their specific needs Such warnings could give them time to take action to protect their assets and infrastructure from an impending solar storm such as temporarily taking sensitive systems offline or moving satellites to different orbits to minimize damage With models like DAGGER there could one day be solar storm sirens that sound an alarm in power stations and satellite control centers around the world just as tornado sirens wail in advance of threatening terrestrial weather in towns and cities across America Related Links Space Weather at NASA Solar Science News at SpaceDaily,.,business

determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time Should that happen his case would be largely transferred to the office of the US Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan  the State Department said Sunday Advertisement Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was let him go Advertisement The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editor in chief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation US consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Representative Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee noted that the government has advised US citizens to leave Russia This is not unexpected in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following Turner an Ohio Republican told CNNs State of the Union Advertisement In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the chance of progress in US efforts to free its detained citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized On Saturday night Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram Interactions between the top US and Russian diplomats have been rare since Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 though they did have a brief conversation last month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference of foreign ministers in India It was the highestlevel inperson talks between the two countries since the war Advertisement That interaction was their first contact since last summer when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a US proposal for Russia to release Whelan and Griner Though Whelan was not included in the oneforone swap that resulted in the release of Griner US officials said they remain committed to bringing him home,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to immediately release journalist Anna Politkovskaya.,science
