presence of the Stormers and Sharks in the last eight at the first attempt is a positive for South African rugby there really should be an additional box in the corner of the TV screen displaying their latest air miles tally Take the Stormers This calendar year alone they have played away in Glasgow London Belfast and Dublin Now having seen off Harlequins in hot humid conditions in Cape Town last Saturday they are having to pack their bags again and head north to face Exeter this Saturday Faced with a similar schedule even Tom Cruises Maverick would be begging for more downtime in the Top Gun hangar A further complication is the looming Easter holiday weekend Not only did Stormers not know exactly where they would be playing until Sunday afternoon but positioning the last 16 and the quarterfinals together with millions of holidaymakers also on the move is making life impractical for European supporters too Even if they have the spare time prices are skyhigh and the hoopjumping is too complicated to make following their team practicable It adds up to a scenario that someone somewhere should have spotted in advance Next year thankfully there will be no Easter clash but the round of 16 and quarterfinals will once more be wedged in alongside each other Why A tournament that was once proudly away fancentric is in danger of becoming one that only really works for broadcasters and travel agents This is both a crying shame and another sign of the times Rugby is changing and the product has to be as tiptop as possible In that respect the South African sides are unquestionably adding extra quality and keeping the rest of the field on their toes Last season the furthest Quins had to travel in this competition was to the south of France Now they have visited both Durban and Cape Town and finished second best both times No visiting side in fact has won in eight attempts on South African soil this season The acid test of southern quality though is about to arrive The Sharks might have stuck 50 points on Munster at home last Satuday but beating Toulouse in Toulouse will require them to ascend to a whole different level Not without good reason did all eight last16 ties end up with the home side progressing compared with only four when the suddendeath format was introduced two seasons ago Exeter are the perfect case study They may not currently be the greatest club side in the world but in their own backyard in front of their own supporters they can supply a culture clash to disconcert anyone let alone slightly dusty longhaul travellers If ever there was a week to lower ticket prices and to pack out Sandy Park with noisy Devonians this is it particularly if one or two Stormers turn up slightly unsure which hemisphere they are in La Rochelles Grgory Alldritt drives at the Gloucester defence during the French sides hardfought victory Photograph Thibaud MoritzAFPGetty Images Hence why any win on the road in the later stages of the Champions Cup is to be savoured As the two South African sides have already discovered the immutable law is that pool standings hugely affect what happens subsequently Leinster and La Rochelle are unbeaten in this seasons competition and are perhaps the last venues in Europe where opponents would fancy heading While that makes Gloucesters heroic stand on the Atlantic coast on Saturday all the more praiseworthy they may just have prodded the La Rochelle beast As the England prop Mako Vunipola has intimated this coming Sundays visitors Saracens anticipate a sharply improved home performance from the off when they travel to the Stade MarcelDeflandre When it comes down to the crunch how many Leicester fans would put their mortgages on their team faring massively better than England did in the Aviva Stadium

Burger have all won a Champions Cup winners medal inside the past five seasons Look back through the record books and 26 South Africans have hit the European final heights over the years which is just two fewer than New Zealand and Australia combined At which point it is reasonable to start wondering what this years quarterfinal lineup might look like without the South African sides frequent flyer

offer lotterylike wins  houses cars and cash prizes  have taken off recently Is their success connected to the costofliving crisisIf someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of ho,If someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of house that would cause Kevin McCloud to collapse into a puddle of adjectives and help raise mil 12846 chars,If someone approached you on the street and told you that for just a tenner you could win the kind of house that would cause Kevin McCloud to collapse into a puddle of adjectives and help raise millions of pounds for charity you would probably ask what the catch was But that improbable offering is Omazes core business Since launching in the UK in April 2020 the organisation has been running prize draws in which for a relatively small amount of money you can be in with the chance to win a multimillionpound dream house When the draw ends a chosen charity partner gets the lions share of the profits The exact odds of winning are unclear  Omaze doesnt publish precise figures and the odds get worse as more people enter  but people do win big and that has kept me interested enough to enter every competition since it first popped up on my Instagram feed While I have only won a 10 Amazon voucher it hasnt stopped me dreaming about what my life would be like if my ticket was drawn  Id probably rent out the house as a luxurious holiday home giving family and close friends free usage offpeak weekends only  Im not made of money before eventually selling it The popularity of these draws  each receives hundreds of thousands if not millions of entries and its still growing  tells us a few things about the UK Namely that as a nation we love escapism and the thought of a big win transforming our lives look to the tradition of doing the pools having a flutter on the Grand National and getting a ticket for the national lottery From another angle it illustrates the sheer ridiculousness of the housing market where the greatest prize we can comprehend is a roof over our head albeit a fancy one It is certainly why as I approach my 25th year as a renter I have been so committed to entering these giveaways There is very little chance of me winning but while the cost of living crisis continues interest rates push 5 and inflation remains double that there is little chance of me being able to afford to buy a house in London either The average property price based on sales in the capital last year was just over 730000 according to Zoopla Alternatively renting has cost me the best part of 150000 since I moved to London in 2006 Who wouldnt dream of a golden ticket out of that scenario Im far from the only person daydreaming in this way I want to help my granddaughters get on the property ladder says one Omaze Trustpilot reviewer People like me cant afford to get on the property ladder This is maybe my only opportunity to own my own house says another Until recently Kevin Johnson a 34yearold carpenter from north London was also prone to daydreaming about life as the owner of a luxury home But he no longer has to wonder  he has just won a 3m house in an Omaze prize draw Johnson and his wife Dee along with their four kids will soon be moving into a beautiful fourbed Victorian semi just 15 minutes from where they now rent a threebed flat As part of the prize as well as any fees and stamp duty being covered they have also won 100000 to help them settle in I dont think its ever going to sink in to be honest says Dee Johnson has been entering the dreamhouse competition for about two years and never really thought he would win but was happy to be giving money to charity More recently he says he had been practising a more positive approach going as far as cutting out a photograph of the London house from an Omaze newspaper advertisement and showing it to his youngest telling him it is where the family would be moving to The parking permit for my van is running out at our current address so I said I wasnt going to replace it until the house had been drawn because I had a feeling I was going to win he says On the day of the draw Johnson received a call from the Omaze team telling him he had won something but not exactly what and that they were on their way to his house He immediately called his wife who works in childcare and education parttime and in healthcare at a hospital She was sceptical As no one was in they went to the pub around the corner to wait for Kevin to get home I thought Who does that It definitely sounded like a scam But Johnson recognised the Omaze presenters voice from the TV adverts and he and the children were soon greeted by the team complete with a mock key to hand over and a camera and lighting crew ready to film a reaction video Johnson later called Dee to tell her the news On her way home from work on a packed train she took the video call but couldnt find her headphones to take it in private He was using this voice Id never heard before he was shaking she says The whole carriage heard what had happened and they all cheered and applauded she says I got off at my stop but sat on the platform for 20 minutes to take it in Apart from looking forward to having more space the couple who have been married for almost 13 years say that very little about their daytoday lives will change  they will be staying in their jobs which they love and as the new house is so close to their old one their children can still go to the same schools In the short term aside from starting their mortgagefree lives Johnson is excited about kitting out the annexe in the garden  a big TV and a sofa nothing crowded he says  but the longer term is packed with freedom and opportunity We have dreams and desires about setting up our own business so we have flexibility with that because of this win says Dee And the children definitely have more security too Its a big win for them Seeing the children living in a house like that  I cant put that into words says Johnson Omazes prize house in Cornwall Photograph Omaze What winners do with the houses which have been all over the UK from the Lake District and the Cotswolds to Kent and  the current prize  Cornwall is entirely up to them It is roughly a threeway split between those who move in to the new house those who sell it and those who rent it out according to James Oakes Omazes chief international officer who is based in the UK Winners have just 96 hours to claim their winnings and agree to the terms and conditions If they dont respond in that time they forfeit the prize which actually happened to one cashprize winner Omaze started life in the US in 2012 founded by Ryan Cummins and Matthew Pohlson two graduates of Stanford University Believing the traditional charity fundraising model to be broken they founded Omaze after attending a charity auction in which they witnessed very wealthy people bid upwards of 15000 to sit alongside Magic Johnson at an LA Lakers game What if they thought they could organise a prize draw with a much lower price to attract a greater number of entrants It took off with moneycantbuy experiences as the main attraction  Omazes Star Wars prize offering the chance to be in Episode VII The Force Awakens raised more than 4m for Unicef and received entries from all over the world It wasnt without criticism with some in the charity world expressing concern over the strategies while a classaction suit was filed in the US in April 2021 alleging Omaze had violated various California laws This was mostly dismissed by a judge in February 2022 and appeared to centre on an argument over whether or not the draw was a legal lottery Perhaps its unrelated but from January this year Omaze has paused its future US operations Omazes UK launch just as the pandemic was kicking off in 2020 was met with similar cynicism which according to Oakes has been a big hurdle for the company Anecdotally about half the friends and colleagues I told about writing this piece had assumed the draws were somehow illegitimate The other half enter each one James Oakes Omazes chief international officer When you buy from Omaze you are not buying a tangible product but you have to trust that we have registered your entry that the draw is taking place fairly that the money really is going to the charity and you will really get the house if you win says Oakes So theres a real premium on doing things properly and establishing trust which is why we have registered with the regulator and abide by the fundraising code of practice It wasnt just the public he had to convince The first draw was for a house in Cheshire worth about 1m The brief was clear  Omaze bought the house would recoup the money from ticket sales and once the books were balanced would give 80 of any profit to a chosen charity partner the company has yet to make a profit itself despite taking 20 of net proceeds It just needed a charity but with reputation at stake none were interested The reticence was understandable We hear from lots of different types of startups with great ideas says Paul Glazier head of corporate partnerships at Alzheimers Research UK Id say 99 of them dont come off or we just cant partner with them We went down on our hands and knees and begged a charity to work with us on that first one says Oakes Teenage Cancer Trust was the first to say yes It received 250000 on the back of the first draw and jumped at the chance to work with Omaze for a second time on a house in Marbella last year Since launching in the UK Omaze has given more than 11m to some of the UKs biggest charities including the British Heart Foundation the NSPCC Great Ormond Street hospital Dogs Trust and after Glazier and his colleagues had done their due diligence Alzheimers Research UK There is now a bidding process in which charities pitch their case We got 1m from the draw for the Lake District house says Lucy Squance director of supporterled fundraising at Alzheimers Research UK For a charity of our size to get that sort of figure is completely transformational And it wasnt just the money We were on primetime TV adverts for two or three months over Christmas We just dont have that kind of advertising power and as a result gained more than 1500 direct supporters and were able to engage with the public in a way we would never be able to otherwise It was worth so much more than the 1m Now established Oakes says the hardest thing is finding suitable houses to give away Its absolute murder Were now buying houses six or seven competitions in advance We used to take houses that were already pristine but as were now able to prepare more we are looking at houses where

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/04/lord-lawson-of-blaby-nigel-lawson-obituary,Lord Lawson of Blaby obituary,One of the most influential postwar Conservative chancellors seen as the main architect of Thatchers radical economic reformsAt the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was ,At the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was immediately interpreted by the more perceptive political analysts  13134 chars,At the time that Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby who has died aged 91 resigned as chancellor in October 1989 his departure was immediately interpreted by the more perceptive political analysts as the beginning of the end of the Thatcher years And so it proved The man whom Margaret Thatcher once called my golden boy the politician who was credited as the main architect of her governments economic success had lit a touchpaper that would smoulder across the months and lead to her ignominious departure a little more than a year later The specific cause of Lawsons resignation was a spat over the prime ministers employment of an independent economic adviser Alan Walters whose views on the then European monetary system EMS chimed with hers but differed from those of the chancellor who sought to use foreign exchange rates rather than interest rates to achieve economic stability At root Thatcher had become increasingly suspicious of Lawson since the credit for the Conservatives 1987 election victory had been attributed to the success of Treasury policy and she feared a loss of political authority if she dismissed Walters Nigel Lawson and Margaret Thatcher at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool 1983 She called him my golden boy Photograph Denis ThorpeThe Guardian One of the letters Lawson received after his resignation was from the former deputy prime minister Lord Willie Whitelaw who commented that Thatcher could not bear to be on the losing side of any argument and added That failing may ditch us all Lawson had taken office as chancellor in 1983 only nine years after his first election to parliament and on resignation was the longest serving in that post since David Lloyd George a record later eclipsed by Gordon Brown He had joined the government as financial secretary to the Treasury when Thatcher formed her first government in 1979 and had already made his mark in that post by abolishing exchange control doubling VAT and introducing the Medium Term Financial Strategy As a radical taxreforming chancellor in pursuit of monetarist policies alongside a massive programme of privatisation and deregulation that helped emasculate the trade union movement he won praise but not popularity respect but not regard from his Conservative colleagues It mattered little to him His fierce intellectual approach to all aspects of policy meant that he always gave a higher priority to achieving his aims than to what others thought His indifference to opposing points of view was often interpreted as arrogance but in reality his personal convictions were such that he was simply not prepared to submit himself to what he saw as the indignities his fellow politicians endured in pursuit of public approbation Nigel Lawson with his daughter the cook and writer Nigella Lawson in 2004 Photograph Richard YoungShutterstock A popular chancellor is not doing his job he said once He believed that a politician who was confident enough to be able to face a barrage of hostility was someone who could make things happen In this regard he had much in common with Thatcher She admired him once calling him brilliant three times in five minutes He in turn admired her readiness to push forward the boundaries of what was politically possible and also shared much of her vision He recognised her political skills and saw how she was able to extend her empathy with the Conservative party to embrace the silent majority of the electorate But he himself was a loner he did not cultivate political friends and he had no clique of supporters or acolytes even at the peak of his political authority in late 1987 There was a rumour that the prime minister was considering moving him to the Foreign Office but nothing came of it His name was infrequently included in lists of potential future party leaders He came into politics as the MP for Blaby in Leicestershire at a relatively late age in February 1974 just before his 42nd birthday But by then he had already had a successful career in journalism and had much experience in politics It seemed that running the Treasury was the summit of his ambition In his maiden speech in the Commons on 1 April 1974 speaking on that years budget he attacked the new Labour chancellor Denis Healey for embarking on a social contract with the trade unions instead of limiting union power in order to control wage inflation Thatcher was impressed She was elected Tory leader in 1975 He was on the frontbench the following year as a whip and appointed as a Treasury spokesman a year later He became a close adviser to Thatcher on the strategy she should pursue His course was set Nigel Lawson at Chatham House central London speaking in his role a chair of the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 Photograph Dan KitwoodGetty Images He had been born into a middleclass Jewish family a household that supported a nanny cook and parlourmaid in Hampstead north London His father Ralph was a commodities broker specialising in tea and his mother Joan nee Davis the daughter of a stockbroker The pianist Dame Myra Hess was a greataunt His paternal grandfather Gustav Leibson who was born in Latvia and escaped the east European Jewish purges of the early 20th century prospered in London sufficiently to send Ralph to Westminster school and changed the family name to Lawson in 1925 Nigel spent his early school years dodging the London blitz  he went to seven different primary schools  before following his father to Westminster He would often describe himself as suffering from laziness but this had no impact on his academic life He won a maths scholarship to Christ Church Oxford where he took a first in philosophy politics and economics His university years were spent partying and playing poker He skied fenced and acted and had nothing to do with politics He did national service for two years in the Royal Navy from 1954 and promoted to lieutenantcommander took command of HMS Gay Charger He was turned down for a career by the Foreign Office in 1956 and instead decided on journalism joining the Financial Times He became city editor of the Sunday Telegraph in 1960 In 1963 his political career began He was recruited by Conservative central office to help the ailing Harold Macmillan with speechwriting and thereafter continued working for his successor Sir Alec DouglasHome through the 1964 election After that I felt I ought to get out on the field and play he wrote later He tried for a series of parliamentary seats before eventually securing selection for the Labour marginal Eton and Slough in 1968 He lost to the popular Labour politician Joan Lestor in 1970 and then in 1972 was triumphantly selected for Blaby from a list of 170 candidates He had turned down the opportunity to become director of the Conservative research department in 1964 and instead returned to journalism first as a columnist at the FT and then in 1966 as editor of the Spectator Under his editorship the magazine took a surprisingly liberal line most notably on the Vietnam war In a signed article Lawson wrote The risks involved in an American withdrawal from Vietnam are less than the risks in escalating a bloody and brutal war He was fired while fighting the 1970 election by his then proprietor Harry Creighton who wanted more personal control of the magazine Now an established journalist Lawson had plenty of work and political interests to pursue In 1972 he became a research fellow at Nuffield College Oxford which led to the publication of a book The Power Game jointly written with Jock BruceGardyne on power and decisionmaking Its conclusions included the proposition that so often it is pure hazard which tips the scale of decision in the end In 1973 he returned to Conservative central office and wrote the crisis package of the partys manifesto for the February 1974 Who Governs Britain election  lost by Edward Heath because of the miners strike and the threeday week Lawson believed that Heath could easily have won the election if he had decided to call it earlier At Westminster Lawson a man who always kept his watch five minutes fast was an early star despite his uncompromising approach He knew what he thought was right and pursued political solutions to that end His instincts were rightwing but could be egalitarian for example supporting the RookerWise amendment in 1977 on inflationproofing income tax allowances helping two Labour backbenchers prevail against their own government Once in government himself he kept a distance from his cabinet colleagues but there was always a plan During his two years as energy secretary from 1981 the only job he held outside the Treasury it was Lawson who was responsible for building up the coal stocks at power stations that would enable Thatcher to confront the striking miners and bring Arthur Scargill to his knees and the coalmining industry effectively to its end By the late 1980s however although his own political star was in its ascendancy and he had created the circumstances that led to the socalled Lawson boom there was growing disquiet within the cabinet The atmosphere of public optimism Lawson was delighted to believe he had created was in contrast to the private antagonism among his colleagues He himself was an implacable opponent of the poll tax which he regarded as absurd but he angered some of his colleagues by failing to help alleviate the impact of the tax having apparently decided that it could not be rescued He and Geoffrey Howe the foreign secretary whom Thatcher demoted in the summer of 1989 had both angered the prime minister with their views on the EMS which they supported and she did not Although Thatcher had repeatedly described Lawsons position as unassailable  even after he had resigned  she managed to fulfil the words of a French saying of which Lawson was particularly fond as a political lodestar It was Tout sarrange mais mal Everything will work out but badly Walters resigned as well And Thatchers authority did begin to look under question After his resignation Lawson opined that Thatcher had become an electoral liability He bitterly resented that what he termed the No 10 black propaganda machine blamed him for all the governments problems and later in a book of memoirs The View from No 11 1992 a majestic overview of the economy under his stewardship was specifically critical of Thatchers loyal press secretary Bernard Ingham He tried unsuccessfully to persuade Howe to stand in the leadership election that followed Thatchers fall finally precipitated by Howe in November 1990 Lawson publicly backed Michael Heseltine in that contest Nigel Lawson outside the House of Lords in 2011 He managed to lose five stone and wrote a book about it Photograph Heathcliff OMalleyShutterstock In retirement Lawson was honest in acknowledging mistakes such as announcing the end of mortgage interest rates before the policy came into force thus overheating the housing market He also said that he should have tightened monetary policy earlier and admitted that the big bang deregulation of Londons financial markets inadvertently led to the financial crisis of 200708 Even though he was not a charismatic orator he always spoke succinctly as for example when challenging from the backbenches yet another consultation on what to do about the poll tax he recalled the words of the French politician Pierre Mends France who once said that to govern was to choose I agree with that said Lawson To appear to be unable to choose is to appear to be unable to govern His main interest however was a campaign to counter the case for global heating He set up a thinktank the Global Warming Policy Foundation designed to challenge international attempts to mitigate the impacts of global heating Lawson claimed that economic growth should not be slowed down to prevent a possible eventuality but that policy should be made pragmatically in response to what had already happened He also accepted a post as president of Conservatives for Britain to campaign in favour of Britain leaving Europe Lawson had become plump during the course of his career but lost about 30 kilos 5st in the year after his resignation and wrote The Nigel Lawson Diet Book 1996 in which he reported that he had resolved that dieting would be his retirement job After stepping down from his parliamentary seat in 1992 he was made a peer and for many years he divided his time between attending the Lords and a home in Gascony in France Lawson was married twice and had six children three of whom were named after him five survive him In 1955 he married Vanessa Salmon the daughter of the J Lyons Corner House dynasty and they had four children Dominic Nigella Thomasina who died in 1993 and Horatia The marriage ended in divorce in 1980 and later that year Lawson married Thrse Maclear a former member of the Commons Library staff with whom he had two children Tom and Emily The couple divorced in 2012 Nigel Lawson Lord Lawson of Blaby politician and journalist born 11 March 1932 died 3 April 2023,business

for a vehicle But when he joined the industry in the 1990s it was in the middle of a wave of change Readily available car finance suddenly meant the public could buy more expensive cars It changed the type of car people bought says Brownridge chief executive of BMW Group UK Drivers could borrow to buy a pricier vehicle in the expectation that it would hold its value and could be sold on later Britons couldnt get enough of it low interest rates helped and BMW rose to become the UKs fourthbiggest seller of cars despite the premium price tag of most of its models And now the industry is facing an even bigger paradigm shift with the transition to electric cars in full swing and newer innovations such as connected and autonomous cars opening the door to different kinds of business Things have changed a lot and are about to change significantly again says Brownridge standing in BMWs flagship showroom on Londons Park Lane I genuinely think we are on the edge of probably the most exciting time in the industry Brownridge is a UK car industry lifer He was born in Oxford  close to the Mini factory which BMW now owns  but when he was small his family moved to Hong Kong so his engineer father could work on the citys mass transit system Ive very fond memories of a very different culture Brownridge says It was a very different world with the UK ruling the city state until the handover in 1997 When Chris Patten last governor of Hong Kong left on the royal yacht Britannia with the then Prince Charles it was quite a sad moment really However his family was always tied to the UK and he returned for his secondary education After university the car industry was the obvious choice I am fascinated by anything with wheels he says It felt very natural to start work with Land Rover then under the Rover Group which was in turn owned by BMW He worked in managing customer relationships and data at Mini Rover and MG Brownridge rose through the BMW ranks via marketing roles overseeing sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympics theres a replica Olympic torch in the corner of the room before taking charge of the Mini brand He became UK chief executive in 2021 overseeing BMWs fourthlargest market after China the US and Germany BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Traditionally carmakers would sell cars to dealers and the dealers handled customer relationships but now manufacturers increasingly sell direct to consumers online Dealers are highly sensitive about suggestions of a changing business model  under which carmakers take more control of the customer relationship  and Brownridge is wary of giving details of what BMW is considering Our longterm strategy is to work with our network of retailers he says emphasising the with However he acknowledges that how we transact is being examined Thats something we need to work on with our partners rather than inflict on them he says Because ultimately our success is mutual Being more involved in the customer relationship will give carmakers more opportunities to make money throughout a vehicles life Carmakers say they will also make their products more attractive Customers are not always happy about being asked to pay more after purchase however BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Brownridge says some of the coverage that focused on the hardware aspect was overlooking the obvious opportunity for software upgrades that can improve drivers experience But the most eyecatching change to the car industry is the shift to electric technology BMW made one in every 10 batterypowered cars sold in the UK in 2022 and a fifth of its UK sales were battery electric  already putting it on track to meet the governments mandate of 22 battery sales by 2024 which was confirmed last week after this interview took place Carmakers will need to be selling 80 battery vehicles by 2030 and 100 by 2035 The government needs to ensure there is enough green energy to power electric cars and put more investment into the UKs charging network BMW has not always been on board with the UK governments plans In 2020 it and other carmakers argued that a ban on internal combustion engines before 2040 would damage the British industry Asked about that stance Brownridge says the UK governments plans are ambitious  not usually a compliment from executives  but achievable for BMW at least amid very strong demand for electric cars Were ready he says We have the products So we are able to respond However he adds that the government needs to ensure there is enough green energy available to power electric cars and must put more investment into the UKs charging network Brownridge says car buyers focus on sustainability will only increase and will soon extend beyond the fuel powering their cars to how the cars are made A focus on greener materials might give premium carmakers an edge as their higher margins can soak up new costs But the BMW boss cites a company visit to a coalmine west of Cologne in Germany as evidence for why green manufacturing will become increasingly important to carmakers The giant Hambach coalmine is bigger than central London in area and Brownridge says a giant machine there scoops out enough coal every day to cover a football field to a height of almost 100 metres You look at that and think well this cant continue because therell be nothing left he says Customer choice will be heavily influenced by their understanding of the same sustainability for the products I think thats quite exciting CV Age 48 Family Married to Ami for 23 years with two

some of the worlds biggest producers agreed to cut production Here we explain what happened and what it might mean for inflation and interest rates Why are oil prices rising An oil refinery in Karbala Iraq Photograph AFPGetty Images The reason oil prices jumped by more than 7 in early London trading was that members of the Opec cartel agreed a surprise cut in production over the weekend The move led by Saudi Arabia will take effect next month and will reduce the supply of crude by more than 1m barrels a day All other things being equal limiting supply of oil leads to an increase in its price and that explains why a barrel of Brent crude  one of the benchmarks for the market  hit nearly 86 a barrel Why has Opec taken this step The King Abdullah financial district in Riyadh Saudi Arabia Photograph BloombergGetty Images This looks like a preemptive move from the cartel ahead of a likely economic slowdown  and possible recession in the US  later this year Opec said its decision was aimed at ensuring stability in the oil market by which it means putting a floor under oil prices of about 80 a barrel Even so the production cut represents a gamble that stronger demand from China  where the economy is recovering from its strict lockdown  will offset the dampening effect on demand in the west It is a sign of the cooling of relations between Washington and Riyadh that the Saudis went ahead with their voluntary production cut despite strong opposition from Joe Bidens administration Will higher prices stick Gas prices advertised at a Chevron station in Los Angeles California Photograph Lucy NicholsonReuters This is the 64m dollar question In the past Opec has announced production cuts and then failed to follow through on the commitments Traders will be looking closely for evidence of quota busting this time But even if there is no cheating todays surge in the oil price to the highest level since January will only stick if the global economy can shrug off the impact of dearer energy If it cant prices will come under downward pressure Ipek Ozkardeskaya senior analyst at Swissquote Bank says it is possible but hard for oil prices to reach 100 a barrel adding If the rising oil prices hit the global demand prospects at quite an uneasy time for the world economy due to the bank stress and further spurs recession worries there is a chance that the rally in oil

come at a worse time for the US the UK and the EU  all of which are battling to reduce upward pressure on the cost of living Although western economies are less oilintensive than they were when Opec first became a household name 50 years ago the cost of crude still matters Higher oil prices make production and transport more expensive and reduce the spending power of consumers Central banks have been expecting inflation to fall sharply this year on the grounds that there will be no repeat of last years increase in energy costs triggered by Russias invasion of Ukraine The Opec move threatens to make the fall in inflation a more protracted affair What does it mean for interest rates The Bank of England raised interest rates from 4 to 425 for the 11th consecutive time last month Photograph Amer GhazzalREXShutterstock In theory central banks should not respond immediately to a rise in oil prices and would only do so if there are knockon effects  businesses raising their prices or offering more generous pay awards to their workers In practice higher oil prices at this juncture will almost certainly make the Federal Reserve the Bank of England and the European Central Bank more cautious If  and it remains a big if  Opec succeeds in permanently pushing up oil prices the result will be that interest rates stay higher for longer That will increase the risk of recession,business

How dare that Big Cupwinning manager  any Big Cupwinning manager  refuse to accept the expertise of a chairman whose proudest footballing achievement was discovering its existence in middleage So Todd took charge of the situation with all the wisdom of a man going into hospital for brain surgery then binning off the doctor to operate on himself Or to put it another way exactly the kind of behaviour one might expect from a 49yearold man with a sweepover fringe and long straggly bits at the back who thinks that Big Cupwinning managers must bow to the flawless logic of his superior exchequer For his part Tuchel  since recruited by the Big Cupshy ignoramuses of Bayern Munich  spent part of this morning lamenting the extent to which Chelsea has changed pining for the good ol days when it was owned by a Russian oligarch The Daily is choking up Back at the Bridge meanwhile they hit upon another winning ruse appointing a noleague winning manager but with the affable compliance that made him and ideal fit for Todd Except in an incredible turnup for the books their brave new world of vulgar spending with no overarching strategy turned out to be rubbish so poor Graham Potter was let go with his metrosexual rollneck still bobblefree and his thatthereLondon beard still getting acquainted with its host face So theres sure to be an interesting atmosphere at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea  who sit 11th in the table  entertain Liverpool scaling the lofty heights of eighth It may be that after dominating the league by winning one consecutive title Jrgen Klopps alltime great side are sated by success and are impervious to cheesy rabblerousing and performative passion Or it may be that bussing all the money in the world on 74 strikers might not have been the smartest tactic Particular
