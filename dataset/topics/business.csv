https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-64980565,Why did the US and allies invade Iraq 20 years ago,The US and three allies invaded Iraq 20 years ago but most countries were against the war,On 20 March 2003 US and allied forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Husseins regime The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to international peace but most countries  5039 chars,Why did the US and allies invade Iraq 20 years ago? Published 20 March Image source Getty Images Image caption The 2003 invasion of Iraq toppled President Saddam Hussein On 20 March 2003 US and allied forces invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Husseins regime. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to international peace but most countries refused to support military action against it. Why did the US want to invade Iraq? In the Gulf War of 19901991 the US had led a multinational coalition which forced invading Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Afterwards the UN Security Council passed Resolution 687 ordering Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction WMDs  a term used to describe nuclear biological and chemical weapons and longrange ballistic missiles. In 1998 Iraq suspended cooperation with UN weapons inspectors and the US and UK responded with air strikes. After alQaedas 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington President George W Bushs administration started making plans to invade Iraq. President Bush claimed Saddam was continuing to stockpile and manufacture WMDs and that Iraq was part of an international axis of evil along with Iran and North Korea. In October 2002 the US Congress authorised the use of military force against Iraq. Many people in Washington believed that there was significant evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that it posed a genuine threat says Dr Leslie Vinjamuri director of the US and Americas Programme at Chatham House a foreign affairs think tank in London. In February 2003 thenUS Secretary of State Colin Powell asked the UN Security Council to give the goahead for military action against Iraq saying it was violating previous resolutions with its alleged WMD programme. However he did not persuade the Council. Most of its members wanted weapons inspectors from the UN and International Energy Authority  who had gone to Iraq in 2002  to carry out more work there to find evidence of WMDs. The US said it would not wait for the inspectors to report and assembled a coalition of the willing against Iraq. Who supported the war? Of the 30 countries in the coalition the UK Australia and Poland participated in the invasion. The UK sent 45000 troops Australia sent 2000 troops and Poland sent 194 special forces members. Kuwait allowed the invasion to be launched from its territory. Spain and Italy gave diplomatic support to the USled coalition along with several east European nations in the Vilnius Group who said they believed that Iraq had a WMD programme and was violating UN resolutions. What allegations did the US and UK make against Iraq? US Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN in 2003 that Iraq had mobile labs for producing biological weapons. However he acknowledged in 2004 that the evidence for this appears not to be... that solid. Image source Getty Images Image caption US Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destructions The UK government made public an intelligence dossier claiming that Iraqi missiles could be readied within 45 minutes to hit UK targets in the eastern Mediterranean. The UKs thenPrime Minister Tony Blair said it was beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein was continuing to produce WMD. The two countries relied heavily on the claims of two Iraqi defectors  a chemical engineer called Rafid Ahmed Alwan alJanabi and an intelligence officer called Maj Muhammad Harith  who said they had firsthand knowledge of Iraqs WMD programme. Both men later said they had fabricated their evidence because they wanted the allies to invade and oust Saddam. Who refused to support the war? Two neighbours of the US Canada and Mexico refused to support it. Germany and France two key US allies in Europe also refused support. French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said military intervention would be the worst possible solution. Turkey  a fellow Nato member and neighbour of Iraq  refused to let the US and allies use its airbases. Middle Eastern countries which had supported the US against Iraq in the 199091 Gulf War such as Saudi Arabia did not support its invasion in 2003. The Gulf Arab states thought the plan was crazy says Professor Gilbert Achcar an expert in Middle Eastern politics at University of London SOAS. They were worried about Iran getting control of Iraq after the fall of Saddams regime. What happened in the war? At dawn on 20 March 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom began with 295000 US and allied troops invading Iraq across its border with Kuwait. 70000 members of the Kurdish Peshmerga militia fought Iraqi forces in the north of the country. By May Iraqs army had been defeated and its regime overthrown. Saddam Hussein was later captured tried and executed. However no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. US troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011. America lost a lot of credibility from this war says Dr Karin von Hippel directorgeneral of the Royal United Services Institute think tank. You still hear people saying twenty years later why do we want to believe American intelligence? The BBCs security correspondent Gordon Corera seeks to find new answers to why the Iraq war happened what it meant and its legacy today.

https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-cities-public-transit-photos/index.html,The worlds best cities for public transit according to Time Out,A survey from Time Out ranks the 19 best cities for mass transit including Berlin Tokyo and New York,Editors Note Sign up for Unlocking the World CNN Travels weekly newsletter Get the latest news in aviation food and drink where to stay and other travel developments Europe and Asia dominate a 3539 chars,Editors Note Sign up for Unlocking the World CNN Travels weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation food and drink where to stay and other travel developments. CNN  Europe and Asia dominate a new list of the worlds best cities for public transit. Time Out the publisher of global city guides polled 20000 people in 50 cities to find out how they feel about their local mass transit systems. The top ten  out of 19 total cities listed  is entirely comprised of destinations in Asia and Europe with Berlin landing in the number one spot. The highest entry from North America is New York City at number 15 and no other continents are represented  better luck next year Buenos Aires Doha and Melbourne. While only residents were surveyed this list is also useful for travelers as they decide where to go next and how best to get around. What makes for great transit? Public transit is a broad term that includes subways aboveground trains buses trams and even ferries. To make it onto Time Outs list at least 80 of polled residents had to agree that its easy to get around their city via mass transportation. According to Time Outs data a whopping 97 of Berliners had positive things to say about their citys mass transit infrastructure praising the network for being reliable comfortable and safe. But there are other factors to consider when traveling by train or bus  namely aesthetics. Stockholm in seventh place was one of the cities praised for its beautiful subway stations. Many of its Tunnelbana stations feature colorful and dramatic designs earning it the nickname the worlds longest art exhibit. Its not only the stations themselves that are known for good looks. Hong Kongs famous aboveground trains known locally as ding dings for the sound they make even have their own Pantone color HK Tram Green. These days the trams appear in a range of colors and designs but the iconic color dates from the postWorld War II era when the British military had a surplus of green paint. In addition to its highlyrated mass transit Singapores Changi airport regularly wins praise. FotoGraphicAdobe Stock Asian standouts Seven of the top 19 cities hailed for their mass transit systems are in Asia. Most are in east Asia with Singapore Shanghai and Taipei all picking up accolades but Mumbai squeaked in at 19th place. The Indian megacity recently introduced Chalo Pay a new app that makes it easier to book and pay for transit tickets without needing to carry cash. But it was Tokyo in third place that had the highest showing for the continent. The citys mass transit was applauded for being wellmaintained efficient and easy to navigate even for nonJapanese speakers. 92 percent of Taipei residents polled by Time Out said their citys transit was easy to use. SimonAdobe Stock European stars Six of the top 19 cities were in Europe with an additional two  London and Edinburgh  in the UK. Several of these cities won praise for having one unified payment system to cover a variety of forms of transit. In Copenhagen a regular commute can include water taxis that whisk travelers across the harbor while 10place Amsterdam makes it seamless to transfer between buses trains and trams. Perhaps its not a coincidence that both of these cities also appear on CNNs list of the worlds best cities for exploring by bicycle. Sustainability initiatives in the European Union mean that many metropolitan areas offer incentives to reduce car traffic. Whether you travel by tram train or bicycle its a way to visit major tourist attractions while reducing your carbon footprint. The worlds best cities for public transit 1. Berlin Germany 2.

Get the latest news in aviation food and drink where to stay and other travel developments. CNN  Theres cause for optimism in the latest report on world happiness. For one benevolence is about 25 higher than it was prepandemic. Benevolence to others especially the helping of strangers which went up dramatically in 2021 stayed high in 2022 John Helliwell one of the authors of the World Happiness Report said in an interview with CNN. And global happiness has not taken a hit in the three years of the Covid19 pandemic. Life evaluations from 2020 to 2022 have been remarkably resilient the report says with global averages basically in line with the three years preceding the pandemic. Even during these difficult years positive emotions have remained twice as prevalent as negative ones and feelings of positive social support twice as strong as those of loneliness Helliwell said in a news release. The report which is a publication of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network draws on global survey data from people in more than 150 countries. Countries are ranked on happiness based on their average life evaluations over the three preceding years in this case 2020 to 2022. The report which was released on Monday identifies the happiest nations those at the very bottom of the happiness scale and everything in between plus the factors that tend to lead to greater happiness. March 20 is the International Day of Happiness a day designated by the United Nations thats marking its 10th anniversary in 2023. Finland where Senate Square in Helsinki is pictured is No. 1 for happiness for the sixth year in a row. espiegleAdobe Stock Sixyear winning streak for worlds happiest nation For the sixth year in a row Finland is the worlds happiest country according to World Happiness Report rankings based largely on life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll. The Nordic country and its neighbors Denmark Iceland Sweden and Norway all score very well on the measures the report uses to explain its findings healthy life expectancy GDP per capita social support low corruption generosity in a community where people look after each other and freedom to make key life decisions. But since we cant all move to Finland is there something other societies can learn from these rankings? Is it are they doing things that we wish wed seen before and we can start doing? Or is it something unique about their climate and history that make them different? And fortunately at least from my perspective the answer is the former said Helliwell who is a professor emeritus at the Vancouver School of Economics University of British Columbia. Taking a holistic view of the wellbeing of all the components of a society and its members makes for better life evaluations and happier countries. The objective of every institution should be to contribute what it can to human wellbeing the report says which includes accounting for future generations and preserving basic human rights. Israel moves up to No. 4 this year from its No. 9 ranking last year. The Netherlands No. 5 Switzerland No. 8 Luxembourg No. 9 and New Zealand No. 10 round out the top 10. Australia No. 12 Canada No. 13 Ireland No. 14 the United States No. 15 and the United Kingdom No. 19 all made it into the top 20. Lithuania with the main square in Kaunas pictured made it into the top 20 in the latest World Happiness Report. Subodh AgnihotriiStockphotoGetty Images While the same countries tend to appear in the top 20 year after year theres a new entrant this year Lithuania. The Baltic nation has been climbing steadily over the past six years from No. 52 in 2017 to No. 20 on the latest list. And the other Baltic countries Estonia No. 31 and Latvia No. 41 have been climbing in the ranks too. Its essentially the same story thats playing out in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe Helliwell said. Countries in those regions probably have normalized that post1990 transition and are feeling more solid in their new identity as the years pass he said. France dropped out of the top 20 to No. 21 in this years report. Nations ranked lower for happiness At the very bottom of the list is Afghanistan at No. 137. Lebanon is one rank above at No. 136. Average life evaluations in these countries are more than five points lower on a scale from 0 to 10 than in the 10 happiest countries. Russias invasion of Ukraine put both countries very much in the global spotlight as the 2022 report was released. So where do these two nations stand according to the latest surveys? Wellbeing in Ukraine has definitely taken a hit but despite the magnitude of suffering and damage in Ukraine life evaluations in September 2022 remained higher than in the aftermath of the 2014 annexation supported now by a stronger sense of common purpose benevolence and trust in Ukrainian leadership the report says. Confidence in their governments grew in both countries in 2022 the survey says but much more in Ukraine than in Russia. And Ukrainian support for the leadership in Russia fell to zero. In this years rankings Russia is No. 70 and Ukraine is No. 92. Looking forward The disruptions of the pandemic have spurred a lot of reflection. People are rethinking their life objectives Helliwell said. Theyre saying Im going back but what am I going back to? What do I want to go back to? How do I want to spend the rest of my life? Hes hoping this move towards thinking about values and other people more explicitly will affect not just factors such as which jobs or schools people choose but also how they operate within those environments. It isnt really about the grades or the salary its about cooperating with other people in a useful way. And of course thats useful for the world but the whole point of this happiness research is that its also good for the people doing it. In other words you do end up feeling better about yourself if youre actually looking after other people rather than number one. Worlds happiest countries for 2023 1. Finland 2. Denmark 3. Iceland 4.

Berlin has been in talks with the European Commission over the past weeks about allowing registrations of cars running on synthetic fuels beyond the 2035 deadline for sales of CO2emitting cars agreed by European Union countries last year. A vote on the ban got delayed early this month by Germanys lastminute objections. The original law would effectively ban registration of combustion engine cars after 2035 but Germany seeks an exemption for cars that run exclusively on climateneutral efuel and legal assurances from the Commission. Reuters reported earlier this week that the European Commission sought to break the impasse with a new draft plan to allow sales of such combustionengine cars after 2035. In a letter to the Commission seen by Reuters on Friday Germanys transport ministry welcomed the EU executives proposals but asked for legislation to ensure its implementation. Berlins demand for an exemption had now been answered by the EU Commission with a letter that makes me optimistic German Transport Minister Volker Wissing told a news conference on Friday. There are still questions to be answered. Were not fully in agreement yet he added. The minister and his FDP party argue that combustion engine technology in which Germany is a leader should continue to be available to offer people more choices for carbonneutral mobility in the future. To ban this technology now makes no sense. Because multiple offers create more and more competition and better prices for citizens Wissing said. Speaking in Brussels on Friday German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said he expected an agreement to be reached soon. Separately Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he believed the dispute had now been resolved and the issue should be settled on Tuesday. EU energy ministers will meet in Brussels on Tuesday and have a chance to sign off on the law. The next opportunity would come at the next scheduled meeting of EU countries ministers in late April. The European Commission declined to comment on the latest proposals.

Securing our skilled labour base is one of Germanys biggest economic tasks for the coming decades Labour Minister Hubertus Heil said. The number of job vacancies in 2022 was at a record high of close to 2 million according to the ministry. One of the reforms is a new immigration law that aims to address key hurdles for migrants to Germany particularly for those coming from outside the European Union. With this we are laying the foundation for a new start in migration policy Finance Minister Christian Lindner tweeted after the cabinet approved the reforms. Anyone who can contribute to the countrys economic success as a skilled worker is welcome. The draft law seen by Reuters says the reform could increase the number of workers from countries outside the EU by 60000 people a year. If people bring professional experience or personal potential with them we will make it possible for them to gain a foothold in our labour market Germanys Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said. It offers foreign workers three pathways to enter the country. The first one requires a professional or university degree recognised in Germany and an employment contract. The second requires a minimum of two years of experience working in a relevant sector and a degree or vocational training. The third is a new opportunity card for individuals who do not have a job offer but have the potential to find work. The opportunity card follows a pointsbased system that takes into account qualifications language skills professional experience connection to Germany and age. The draft contains a number of innovative and sensible ideas but it is not farreaching enough to do justice to the problem we are facing migration expert Herbert Bruecker told Reuters. He said the requirements of the opportunity card were too complex just for a temporary visa to look for work. The cabinet also approved an education law that entitles young people to paid offthejob training. Germanys Federal Labour Agency will pay up to 67 of the net salary for the duration of the training. The cabinet also decided to extend regulations for jobseekers from Albania BosniaHerzegovina Kosovo the Republic of Northern Macedonia Montenegro and Serbia which were previously expected to expire at the end of the year. Germany will be able to recruit up to 50000 workers annually from these countries. Under this regulation Germany had previously been able to recruit 25000 workers per year. Bruecker welcomed this extension noting that employment rates among these immigrants were between 97 and 98 three to five years after moving to Germany. The scheme is a complete success and it should be extended to other countries Bruecker said.

The coaches analysed things well they showed where the mistakes were at the World Cup. We have discussed many things and hope to show them to you in the next two matches. Germany fourtime World Cup winners and threetime European champions have crashed out early in their three most recent tournaments including Euro 2020 in 2021 where they lost to England in the last 16. As hosts in 2024 they do not need to qualify for the tournament but they want to prepare a team in the next 15 months that can again become competitive on the international stage starting with their friendly matches this month.

The EUs executive European Commission is due on April 18 to set out draft reforms to rules for handling stricken banks. It comes at a time of heightened sensitivity in the sector following UBS shotgun merger with Credit Suisse and the collapses of several U.S. banks including Silicon Valley Bank. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in a letter to the European Commission and the Eurogroup that the EU executive should respect the clear agreement made in June last year to preserve the framework for socalled Institutional Protection Schemes. From what I have now learned... this will not be the case Lindner said. An EU official said the Eurogroup asked the commission to strengthen and harmonise rules governing the use of national deposit guarantee schemes funds when a bank is in trouble. The Commission has consulted extensively member states and stakeholders before finalising the proposal. It will be a balanced proposal taking into account the specificities of national banking models and a useful reform on the path towards completing the Banking Union the EU official said. The schemes link banks in a national network allowing a struggling lender to get financial aid from the schemes other members forming part of a countrys protections for bank depositors. Participating banks pay into the network and benefit from reductions in some capital and liquidity requirements. Such schemes have been set up in Germany Austria Italy Spain and Poland. CARVE OUT Lindner said the commissions current plans would introduce a number of new and significant restrictions on IPS schemes by treating them like deposit guarantee schemes. Other elements in the draft plans such as the very broad scope of the rules would lead to very difficult negotiations Lindner said. A clear and precise carveout for IPS from newly introduced restrictions would be the easiest and cleanest way to respect last years agreement not to tamper with IPS Lindner said. My team will provide concrete drafting suggestions for such a carve out to your colleagues Lindner told EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness in the letter. A report for the European Parliament last year said IPS represents a central and substantial component of depositor protections in Germany. But there are questions over whether banks in an IPS pay enough into an EU central bank rescue fund and whether it is clear which authority is in charge if a lender in a scheme is failing the report said.

The agreement will allow some combustion engines beyond 2035 and was quickly condemned by a prominent environmental group. The bloc and its largest economy had been at odds over the planned 2035 phaseout of CO2emitting cars but leaders signalled in recent days that they were close to a resolution. Germany had wanted assurances that new combustion engine cars can be sold beyond the deadline if they run on efuels  a request supported by parts of Germanys powerful car industry. We have found an agreement with Germany on the future use of efuels in cars Frans Timmermans head of EU climate policy said on Twitter. German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said the way is clear with the agreement reached late Friday. Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO2neutral fuels he said in a post on Twitter. Sweden which holds the EUs rotating presidency said EU diplomats would vote on Monday to formally approve the 2035 phaseout law. That would mean energy ministers could then give the law the final signoff needed for it to enter into force on Tuesday at a scheduled meeting in Brussels. Benjamin Stephan of the Greenpeace campaign group said the deal was a setback for climate protection. This stinky compromise undermines climate protection in transport and it harms Europe he said. It dilutes the needed focus of the auto industry on efficient electromobility he said.

Goetze made his international comeback last year after a fiveyear absence. Germanys support at home has waned in recent years with the fourtime world champions struggling to fill stadiums having been eliminated early in their last three tournaments. Their disappointing groupstage exit in Qatar has added more pressure on the team. You learn from challenges and from not so good times. Its not always just going to get better in football. So you learn and you grow Goetze said. The midfielder is no stranger to career ups and downs. After lifting the World Cup he struggled to hold down a starting spot at Bayern Munich following his surprise departure from Borussia Dortmund in 2013. A return to Dortmund in 2016 proved less than successful before he revived his career with a twoseason spell at PSV Eindhoven in 2020 before joining Eintracht Frankfurt last year. I am relaxed about Qatar. Thats the good thing with football. You can quickly move on Goetze said. Our view is going only into the future and we try to take the best from all our experiences.

Pushed by fears that persistently low Russian gas supplies could lead to shortages the German government introduced energysaving measures last year such as banning heating for private swimming pools and encouraging people to work from home. Germans managed to save energy last winter amid fears of blackouts and a government campaign to push citizens and industry to cut energy use by 20. Before the crisis between 2008 and 2020 the countrys energy savings stood at less than 6. This month the German cabinet is due to pass a new law making even greater savings obligatory for the public and private sectors according to the draft law.

REUTERSFabrizio Bensch BERLIN March 20 Reuters  Talks between Germanys Transport Ministry and the European Commission about the planned end of new combustion engines from 2035 are moving forward the ministry said on Monday but added it could not say when an agreement would be reached. After months of negotiations the European Parliament the Commission and European Union member states agreed last year to the law that would require new cars sold in the EU from 2035 to have zero CO2 emissions  effectively making it impossible to sell combustion engine cars from that date. But Germany this month declared its lastminute opposition. It wants sales of new cars with internal combustion engines to be allowed after that date if they run on efuels. There are positive trends that are a good basis for further talks a spokesman for the ministry told a news conference. The ministry run by the liberal Free Democratic Party FDP proposed last week that the Commission should provide a separate vehicle category for cars that run only on efuels a letter from the ministry to the EU executive seen by Reuters showed. The Commission declined to comment on the letter which also suggested allowing carmakers to count such cars towards complying with CO2 targets. EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said in a news conference on Thursday that once a deal on a law is agreed between EU countries and the European Parliament it is important that both sides respect it. At the same time we have to make sure that the interpretation of that agreement people give is also something we can agree upon. And this is an ongoing conversation we are having with the German authorities right now Timmermans said. Such changes are legally problematic as the European Parliament has approved the regulations agreed between the blocs member states and the Commission meaning any change could be complicated and timeconsuming. An EU official said member states had been told at a meeting in November that the Commission would make a proposal on registering cars running on efuels after 2035 but only after the CO2 law for cars is finally adopted.

After months of prevaricating the German government announced in late January it would provide Kyiv with the stateoftheart fighting vehicles as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 Americanmade M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 in order to make up the numbers of a Ukrainian battalion with Portugal contributing three tanks and Sweden 10. Poland has supplied Ukraine with a battalion of the older Leopard 2 A4 model. As promised our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends Boris Pistorius the German defence minister said on Monday night. I am sure that they can make the difference on the front. The vehicles were handed over at the Ukrainian border at the end of last week the news magazine Der Spiegel reported adding that 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and two tank recovery vehicles promised by Berlin have also arrived in Ukraine. For security reasons the German government would not comment on the route by which the tanks were delivered. Kyiv which had a limited numbers of tanks from the Soviet or postSoviet era has said it urgently needs heavier armour for its defence against Russias invasion with the Germanmade Kampfpanzer Leopard 2 at the top of its list. Armed with a 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns the 1970sdesigned machine is the most popular tank in Natos inventory because of its speed of up to 42 miles an hour fuel efficiency and ability to shoot with high levels of accuracy even while manoeuvring over rough terrain. Operated by a crew of four  a commander gunner loader and driver  about 2000 Leopard 2s are in use by European countries. Over the last two months Ukrainian soldiers have been trained in using the complex weapons system of the tanks A6 variant at a Bundeswehr site in Munster Lower Saxony. The Ukrainian soldiers did not only prove themselves to be incredibly motivated but also able to handle the technology and deployment principles a Bundeswehr commander Bjrn Schulz told Der Spiegel. Confirmation that the German tanks had been delivered came as the Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Iryna Zolotar said Britishmade Challenger 2 tanks were in Ukraine already. The defence minister Oleksii Reznikov posted a picture of a Challenger 2 alongside other westernmade military vehicles on his Facebook page describing the British vehicle as a work of military art. The UKs Ministry of Defence declined to comment but confirmed Ukrainian tank crews training in Britain had returned home after completing their tank training.,Germanys muchawaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine the German defence ministry has confirmed.

Since antiCovid measures ended across Europe last year tourism has started to recover but there are growing signs that significant numbers of French and Germans  two of the largest markets for UK tourism  are staying away. Since October 2021 EU citizens have needed a passport to enter the UK. Previously they could use ID cards but less than half the population of France and Germany hold a valid passport. People who run tourist attractions and businesses in the UK say that although Americans have returned in large numbers the French and Germans have not. Jerseys government is so concerned that last month it announced a pilot project allowing French citizens to show their ID cards on day trips to the island. This year walking tours in Oxfordshire a significant part of the tourist trail for foreign visitors are seeing bookings from France and Germany at half their 2019 levels. The number of passenger vehicles transported by Le Shuttle through the Channel tunnel in the first two months of 2023 dropped to 251175 compared with 314497 in 2019. Brittany Ferries said in December that it had 155000 arrivals in 2022 compared with 338000 in 2019. The decline is not just down to the issue of passports  Brexit has also battered the perception of Britain as a welcoming nation for tourists. Data from Visit Britain and the Anholt Ipsos Nation Brand Index shows a decline in how French and German people view the UKs standing compared with other countries. In 2016 Germans ranked the UK as the 7th best place to visit and French people ranked it 9th. By 2022 the UK had fallen to 16th and 14th respectively. Joss Croft OBE chief executive of UKinbound the trade association for the inbound tourism industry said French and German tourists still regard the UK very highly. However we know that the introduction of the new requirement for passports for EU citizens to access the UK  is proving to be a deterrent to travel particularly for school groups due to the additional costs and bureaucracy he said. School groups are particularly badly affected because if one or two children in a class of 30 do not have passports teachers will elect to travel to Ireland or Malta for English language trips instead. Children with nonEU passports such as refugees will also need a 95 visa to enter the UK. Research by the Tourism Alliance last year found there had been an 83 drop in schoolchildren and students visiting the UK leading to a loss of 875m and 14500 jobs. About 28 million people in Germany have passports according to a 2007 parliamentary answer out of a population of 83 million. In France about 32 million passports have been issued in the last 10 years out of a population of 67 million. Hayley BeerGamage chief executive of Experience Oxfordshire said that bookings from French and German groups were at 50 of prepandemic levels. That clearly shows that actually the market isnt returning and the desire  to visit Oxfordshire England the UK is not there as it was before the pandemic she said. Weve got to make sure that the nation is not losing those markets the other side of the pandemic. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Broadly speaking many Europeans have a less favourable view of some aspects of the UK he said. They are a really important market. The Germans particularly visit parts of Britain that others do not like Devon and Cornwall. But theyre not going to disappear. Last month when Rishi Sunak met Emmanuel Macron following the announcement of the Windsor framework the leaders announced that France and the UK would expand opportunities for school trips. Emma English executive director of the British Educational Travel Association Beta said that ID cards remained an issue but her members were enthused by the declaration. There is however no information on this she added. Beta has written to Robert Jenrick the immigration minister asking for details. Businesses are also concerned about plans to introduce electronic travel authorisation ETA rolling out from October. The scheme similar to the USs Esta system will mean that even tourists who do not require a visa will need to pay for a digital permit. Richard Toomer executive director of the Tourism Alliance said ETAs need to be priced at a reasonable level. We really need to look again at our high visa costs he said.

Rishi Sunak may have no better luck stopping the small boats with his plan to put refugees on barges or send them to Rwanda. But the extent to which governments will go to defend their borders shows just how hot a political topic migration has become across developed western countries. Nor is it just the case in the US and UK. Sweden and Germany have seen the emergence of antiimmigration parties in recent years as the number of migrants has increased. In the case of the UK net migration  the numbers arriving minus the numbers leaving  has been positive for the past three decades. According to figures from the House of Commons library immigration exceeded emigration by more than 100000 in every year from 1998 to 2020. Boosted by oneoff factors such as the war in Ukraine net migration hit a record of just over 500000 in the year to last June. This 30year trend marked a break with the past. In the 1960s and 1970s more people left Britain than arrived and it was only in the early 1990s that net migration really started to increase. This is perhaps understandable. There was mass unemployment in the 1980s and early 1990s and the UK was not the most attractive place for someone looking for work. But the UK economy grew uninterruptedly from 1992 to 2008 and there were plenty of jobs of the highpaid variety in the post big bang City of London and of the lowpaid variety in hospitality and social care. This was also the period when globalisation took off with cheap goods from newly openedup lowcost countries  such as China  boosting consumer purchasing power in western economies. The prosperity of the developed world was not lost on those in lowerincome countries leading inevitably to more people seeking to find a better standard of living in Europe or North America. In a way higher net migration into the west was the flipside of capital flows out of it to the emerging world. The money went one way people went the other. By no means all the people arriving in the UK come to work. Indeed only about a third cite that reason with a slightly higher proportion coming to study and much of the rest seeking asylum. Even so net migration has increased the size of the labour force and filled vacancies that might otherwise have gone unfilled. Under the new postBrexit arrangements which scrapped free movement for EU citizens and introduced a pointsbased system for work visas net migration has gone up. In Britain  and elsewhere  this raises two questions. The first is whether the level of net migration matters. From a freemarket perspective it does not because labour  like capital  should be allowed to find its way to the parts of the world where it can be most productively employed. Demographic change means populations in the west are getting older and the lack of available workers is adding to inflationary pressure. So why not allow migrant labour to plug the gaps? In reality no mainstream political party agrees with this approach not least because unrestricted immigration strains the developed countrys social infrastructure especially housing. It also deprives developing countries of their brightest workers. The corollary of open borders  at least in a small country such as Britain  is that the planning laws would need to be liberalised so that millions of new homes could be built to accommodate a growing population. Otherwise demand for property would massively exceed supply and houseprice inflation would rocket. The prevailing economic model  low wages and expensive rents for those at the bottom coupled with soaring property prices for the better off  would be further entrenched. There is though a second question how should governments in the west seek to manage migration? The stock answer is by improving education and training so that domestic workers eventually do the jobs currently done by migrants coupled with strictly policed quotas for sectors hardest hit by labour shortages. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day  well point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

It does though ignore the fact that the desire to move to the west has almost certainly intensified as a result of the overlapping crises of recent years. Climate breakdown which has a disproportionate impact on lowincome countries is bound to increase this pressure. The head of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva said last week her organisation had revised down growth projections for lowincome countries where per capita income growth was falling further behind the rates needed to catch up with advanced economies. This threatens to reverse a decadeslong trend of steadily converging living standards she said. David Malpass the World Bank president was equally gloomy noting that 700 million  almost 10 of the global population  were living on less than 2 a day. Both the IMF and the World Bank are urging developed nations to do more to help poor countries build economic resilience but these appeals are more often than not falling on deaf ears. There is a lack of urgency about finding a solution to the looming debt crisis or in providing the resources needed to tackle the impact of global heating. Sunak talks tough on immigration but is doing little to reduce the incentives for people to come here in the first place. It would be naive to expect instant results from a less pennypinching approach but after cuts to aid the government is spending five times more on refugees in the UK than it is spending on assistance to Africa. This represents a classic case of false economy because any shortterm gains to the Treasury will be dwarfed by the longerterm costs.,Donald Trump never did manage to build the wall on the USs southern border.

These will be the first international matches after the World Cup which was attractive in sporting terms but controversial in Europe. Qatar benefits from football for its political goals. We should do the same. The 2024 European Championship being in the heart of Europe offers the ideal opportunity to do so. Germany welcomes the continent and seeks to defend it with the common achievements that make it strong. The tournament obliges us to put football back in the spotlight. Fans want a purity and simplicity that goes back to the essentials play sport fun togetherness. One ball one team clear rules. Football has been a unifying element in Europe for more than a century. It is a constant driver of equal opportunities diversity and freedom. In times of polarisation and division in our societies it is all the more important to strengthen this. Football provides many vivid political analogies how does an individual behave in a group? What freedom does the game provide in the face of the imperative to conform to a tactic? How do rules shape our coexistence? If youre talking about football youre talking about social sustainability. You dont win anything on your own. Every child who plays football understands that. That football works as a game was experienced in Qatar. The best teams had an identity. Argentina radiated joy and determination you could tell they knew what they were running for their teammates and their country. Appreciation comes from the respect of others and when everyone realises that their contribution is important they fight. For France Olivier Giroud became a role model. In the final he was substituted before the break. It was the coachs admission that he had chosen the wrong strategy. That is a blow for every athlete he only accepts something like that when there is a bigger goal and he understands that it needs a new attempt. Afterwards Giroud acted in solidarity and rooted for the team from the bench. He had understood the coachs decision. He also knows that in France as in every European country football has a social significance. In such cases a football tournament leaves its mark on the nation and the whole thing is amplified for a long time when the hosts are involved. So the responsibility for Germany is enormous especially given their team were knocked out early in the past three tournaments. There was no lack of talent but there was a lack of leadership a lack of a we and a why. What does it mean to be a national player? What does football mean for our common good? These are important questions often forgotten. Fans embraced the German national womens football team despite them losing out to England in the Womens Euro 2022 final. Photograph Andre PainAFPGetty Images The national team are different from a club team. There is three times as much money involved in the big clubs as there was 10 years ago. The national team meanwhile have to escape the logic of growth. It cannot be about higher bonuses. A player who earns an annual salary of 15m20m does not need 200000 or 400000. A national player should know their duties. The child in the jersey and the volunteer in the amateur club want to see themselves represented by him or her. If he or she gives them something he or she gets something back. I remember when millions of people celebrated us and also themselves in 2006. This attachment in turn creates an added value for the players that money cannot buy that can protect you in this tough business in more difficult days. The love that Lionel Messi is now experiencing from Argentina will not exist for him in Paris. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

After the pandemic Russias attack on Ukraine and the energy crisis it would be good if we all rediscovered ourselves together. Only if we in all our diversity stick together will we defy the crises and conflicts. Adaptation is needed to the new challenges of climate change and geopolitics.

Addressing more than 1100 shareholders at the St Jakobshalle arena in Mnchenstein near Basel Switzerland UBS bosses said they understood why investors may be bewildered or even angry after the surprise deal that was announced on 19 March and followed weeks of panic about the health of the banking sector. It was a historic day and a day we hoped would not happen the chair of UBS Colm Kelleher said. Yet it is a significant milestone not only for UBS and Credit Suisse but also for Switzerland for the global financial industry. While Kelleher acknowledged the governmentorchestrated deal came with risks he defended the takeover and said it presented a business opportunity for UBS. However bosses said all options were on the table such as a future split or spinoff of Credit Suisse assets. Some shareholders acknowledged the potential benefits of the takeover but said they were concerned about this new giant bank which is expected to hold a combined 5tn 4tn in invested assets including the possibility of unjustified pay hikes and job cuts. e This will in no way justify any inflation of remuneration one shareholder said urging bosses to be prudent even as they prepared to manage a muchlarger bank. The current plan are already extremely generous the shareholder added. Investors also raised the alarm about thousands of potential job cuts as bosses try to get rid of duplicate roles. Those synergies you were referring to would potentially costs more than 30000 jobs worldwide a shareholder said referring to recent press reports. These social consequences also in Switzerland could be dramatic and the reputation of UBS could also suffer. Banking is people dont forget that another investor added.

The talks between postal service bosses and the Communications Workers Union CWU at the Westminsterbased Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service ended after 1am on Wednesday with the two sides failing to reach agreement on pay and conditions. The dispute has lasted for almost a year with 18 days of strikes held between August and the end of 2022. The CWU won a strong mandate to take further action in a member ballot in February and its leaders were last week considering further strikes in April if talks failed. Its postal executive will meet on Wednesday to discuss further options. The latest negotiations were led by Dave Ward the CWUs general secretary and several Royal Mail board members although the chief executive Simon Thompson and chair Keith Williams were not directly involved. The company on Wednesday said it had increased its offer to the union but that it was not an option to carry on without significant changes. The CWU said that unacceptable pressures were being placed on postal workers. Royal Mail is owned by the recently renamed International Distributions Systems IDS the FTSE 250 company created when the postal service was privatised. IDS has said that Royal Mail the part that runs the UKs regulated letter delivery business is expected to lose between 350m and 400m this year and had even raised the possibility of putting the company into a form of administration if talks fell through. Royal Mail may face more strikes as talks with union end without deal Read more A source close to Royal Mail said the final breakdown related to differences in terms and conditions for new employees who were paid less than longerserving staff. The company had offered to bring new employees to pay parity over five years but the CWU wanted parity within three years the source said. However the CWU argued that was a selective account. A spokesperson said The company advised the union that the directors who have been leading negotiations are no longer available and that the board will be meeting today to determine their next steps. There has been progress in several areas and the union made it clear last night that we are willing to continue negotiations today and tomorrow to finalise an agreement. This offer has been reiterated to the company this morning.

CBI boss Tony Danker steps aside amid allegations of misconduct Read more Updated at 12.44 BST 5 Apr 2023 12.19 BST What is the CBI and who funds it? Anna Isaac The Confederation of British Industry CBI is the UKs most prominent business lobbying organisation. It is a notforprofit organisation founded by royal charter in 1965 after a merger of older employer bodies. It claims unrivalled access to government. It also claims to have the biggest number of policy specialists outside of Whitehall the seat of the British government in order to support its 190000 business members which are the chief source of its income. Its total income was 25m in 2021 of which 22m was from membership fees. Its membership is composed of direct members and members of other trade bodies. Its 1500 direct members are businesses that actively hold membership such as the supermarket Asda the jet engines manufacturer RollsRoyce and the law firm Allen  Overy. Fees vary significantly toptier businesses can pay 90000 annually some midsized companies pay half this price and smaller companies pay far less. The bulk of its membership comes via trade bodies such as the National Farmers Union and the Federation of Master Builders. The CBI counts these trade bodies memberships within its own 190000 total. The lobby group has access to the prime minister and cabinet and campaigns on issues ranging from funding for childcare to tax and skills. Its relationship with the UK government was stretched severely by Brexit with its access to Number 10 much curtailed. A remark attributed to the former prime minister Boris Johnson  fuck business  was considered to be aimed at efforts by the CBI and others to try to influence the postBrexit UKEU trade agreement. Its former director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn sought to rebuild ties with the government during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic including working alongside trade unions and No 10 on developing the furlough scheme. Tony Danker took over from Fairbairn the CBIs first female boss in November 2020. He continued a focus on reengaging with the government and the opposition Labour party. He was criticised for speaking in support of Liz Trusss disastrous minibudget in September 2022. The CBI is governed by a president and an executive committee which in normal times is chaired by the director general. It also has a board of nonexecutive directors which the director general sits on. 5 Apr 2023 12.13 BST Weve got confirmation that the Treasury and the Department for Business and Trade have postponed meetings with the Confederation of British Industry CBI while the business group investigates allegations of sexual misconduct. 5 Apr 2023 11.52 BST Treasury and business department postpone meetings with CBI after Guardians sexual misconduct claims UPDATE THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED.

A Treasury source said it had paused engagement while the investigation is ongoing with a similar approach adopted by Kemi Badenochs department. PA understands this means scheduled meetings between ministers and the lobbying group have been postponed as a result of the pause. The CBI the UKs most prominent business lobbying organisation has also cancelled forthcoming events including its annual dinner after the Guardian revealed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by its staff. The CBI has been thrown into turmoil after the Guardian reported claims from more than a dozen women who said that they had been victims of various forms of sexual misconduct by senior figures at the CBI. This included an account from a woman who alleged she was raped at a staff party on a boat on the River Thames. The latest allegations of misconduct by senior figures at the CBI are separate to those made about its director general Tony Danker last month. Updated at 12.16 BST 5 Apr 2023 11.12 BST Royal Mail says talks end without a deal Royal Mail said after 11 months of talks with the Communication Workers Union over pay and changes to working patterns negotiations have ended without a deal. A spokesperson said After 11 months of talks including mediation by Sir Brendan Barber and Acas we are deeply concerned that our talks with CWU have concluded without an agreement. We made substantial efforts to reach an agreement including making a number of further improvements to our offer. These improvements were all based on feedback from the CWU and we were hopeful that the CWU would put a deal to its members. We remain committed to reaching an agreement with the CWU. We have been clear throughout the dispute that not transforming our network and working practices is not an option in a business losing more than 1 million a day. In the best interests of the business our customers and the job security of our postmen and women change cannot be delayed any further. 5 Apr 2023 11.10 BST UK services growth slows despite record export sales The UKs service sector has been growing for three months according to a survey but showed a slowdown last month despite record export growth. The SP GlobalCIPS UK services PMI survey showed a reading of 52.9 last month down from Februarys 53.5. Any reading above 50 points to expansion any reading below suggests a contraction. The businesses polled reported their biggest jump in export sales since the survey started tracking this in September 2014. Tim Moore economics director at SP Global Market Intelligence which compiles the survey said March data confirmed that the UK service sector returned to growth during the first quarter of 2023 supported by a sustained rebound in new orders as business and consumer confidence improved from the lows seen last autumn. Export sales provided an additional boost to the service economy during March as the ongoing recovery in business travel and events helped to drive the fastest rise in new orders from abroad for at least eight and a half years. Increases in prices that service companies charged dropped to a 19month low in March but this was still higher than at any point between 1996 when the survey began and 2021. Increases in costs faced by these businesses eased to the lowest level for 22 months but remained exceptionally strong the survey said.,From 5 Apr 2023 12.46 BST UK government suspends relationship with CBI Richard Partington The government has suspended its relationship with the Confederation of British Industry as pressure mounts after the Guardian revealed multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by the lobby groups staff.

While Sara is leftfooted and plays in central defence Karen favours her right foot and anchors midfield but back in the dressing room the pairs similarities far outweigh the differences. Even Evertons manager Brian Srensen has been known to confuse one identical twin with the other. Being left and rightfooted is the biggest difference. Im maybe a bit quieter but otherwise were nearly the same says Sara before Karen interjects. I have a higher bun she points out gesturing to her hair. But were just enjoying being here together its something special. The Holmgaards relish following the path set by their similarly identical male football counterparts Jacob and Josh Murphy who played together at Norwich for a time and Michael and Will Keane once regular fixtures in assorted Manchester United and England youth teams. In the womens sphere a precedent was set by the Kmita twins Mollie and Rosie although that pair have now swapped West Ham for sports broadcasting. As the Holmgaards prepare for Friday nights Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Goodison Park retirement is the last thing on the 24yearolds minds but they accept they are unlikely to synchronise their entire careers. Indeed they have only recently been reunited after being divided for the first time when Sara spent the first half of this season on loan at Denmarks Fortuna Hjrring. Although strictly temporary this parting of the ways proved a useful exercise in independence for the Danish siblings who had previously played together at Hjrring and Germanys Turbine Potsdam. It was our first time without each other and yeah of course it was a good thing says Sara. We learned a lot about a lot of things. We expected it to be difficult and it was hard  but not as hard as I imagined. It was nice to try to live alone and also to show people outside that we can be apart. Karen Holmgaard right in action against Manchester United in October while Sara was away on loan. Photograph Emma SimpsonEverton FCGetty Images Karen believes the dual Denmark internationals have now achieved a perfect balance at their shared apartment in Liverpools fashionable docklands area. Sometimes I go out with a friend and Sara stays at home she says. But we have a lot of the same friends so were often all chilling together. Sara is particularly appreciative of her new habitat. The cultures different to Germany she says. Personally I love to be here. The people are so warm and friendly. Theyre just kind its good to be among them. The football culture in Germany was tough too. The games were a lot about power but in England although the intensitys the same theres a lot more possession. In Germany we had a lot of running in training but here its much more tactical. As Karen emphasises it also helps that the pair previously worked with Srensen at Hjrring. I think he was the main thing for us to move over here last summer she says. We had Brian for two years before and we really enjoyed that time. He supports us and we just like him as a manager. But even after working with Brian for so long there are still times when we confuse him. Perhaps most memorably at Hjrring Sorensen once congratulated Sara for a goal scored by Karen. At school people couldnt see the difference says the latter. So sometimes we did something funny and tricked them. During that childhood in Mid Jutland the duo excelled at both football and handball and it was only after a joint postcollege discussion that they opted to pursue mutual success in the former with their neartelepathic onpitch connectivity and intertwin competitiveness helping secure them senior Denmark debuts in 2019. We wouldnt have this life now if we hadnt each pushed the other on acknowledges Sara. After joint involvement in Euro 2022 they hope to be on the plane to this summers World Cup in Australia and New Zealand where Denmark face England in a groupstage game in Sydney. Its going to be tough says Karen. England are good. I think theyre better than us right now but well see.

The Competition and Markets Authority CMA said today it is examining whether Wowcher misled consumers by using countdown timers and other urgency claims. The probe will look into the use of timers telling shoppers that deals will soon disappear as well as other online selling practices used by the business including how it enrols consumers in its membership scheme. Sarah Cardell chief executive of the CMA said People who buy online should not be pressurised by practices implying that they must act quickly to avoid missing out when this is not the case.

Berenberg say Eurozone inflation plunged even more than expected in March dragged down by energy prices returning to base. The headline rate fell to 6.9 yoy in March from 8.5 in February below the Reuters consensus expectation of 7.1. After a postCOVID19 bounce in 2021 inflation rates surged in 2022 on the back of a huge spike in energy and food prices caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But European benchmark prices for natural gas and oil have declined from their peaks and are now lower than they were a year ago. As a result the energy price component of the Eurozones Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices HICP fell by 0.9 yoy in March versus a 13.7 yoy rise in February. Food prices however rose further  increasing 15.4 yoy in March after 15 in February Putins war has also dramatically pushed up food prices as both Russia and Ukraine are major agricultural exporters. Recent poor harvests in some other countries added to the supply troubles. 31 Mar 2023 12.16 BST The pound is on track for its best month since November helped by the UKs improving economic outlook.

I believe its a plan that lays the foundations for a durable peace in Ukraine and is perfectly aligned with the United Nations charter and its principles which have been violated by Putin with his invasion Snchez said. I stressed the importance that Ukraine as a free and sovereign state should be the one to decide on the issues that affect it. Beijings plans were largely dismissed by leaders in the west. When asked about Chinas plan on Friday Snchez said he welcomed Beijings complete and total rejection of the threat and use of nuclear weapons in the conflict and its support for territorial integrity.

Podolyak posting to Twitter said any ceasefire that would allow Russia the right to stay in occupied territories of Ukraine would be totally inadmissible. He added Ukraine has the right to move troops and equipment on its territory as it deems necessary. Once again by points. Any ceasefire will mean RFs right to stay in the occupied territories. This is totally inadmissible...  has the right to move troops and equipment on its territory as it deems necessary. Weird peacekeepers look ridiculous.    PodolyakM March 31 2023 31 Mar 2023 14.53 BST Russias ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has rejected charges brought against President Vladimir Putin by the international criminal court ICC for overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children. The ICC issued an arrest warrant earlier this month for Putin and his childrens rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna LvovaBelova for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children and their transfer from areas of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. It is unclear how many children have been taken from Ukraine by Russian forces. The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab published a report last month alleging that at least 6000 children from Ukraine had been sent to Russian reeducation camps in the past year. The ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has said his office had identified the deportation of at least hundreds of children taken from orphanages and childrens care homes. Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has estimated the number of deported children at far more than 16000. Many of these children were taken from their parents at filtration points as they tried to leave newly captured territory removed from care institutions or taken from people who were caring for them after their parents were killed in the war. The Russian leadership has been overt about taking Ukrainian children to Russia and placing them in camps or putting them up for adoption by Russian families. Moscow says millions of people have chosen to move to Ukraine. Ambassador Nebenzia in an interview with Russias stateowned Tass news agency said We are talking about evacuation from a war zone in full compliance with obligations under international humanitarian law as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Millions of people have been evacuated in this way including children who in the overwhelming majority of cases arrive in Russian territory with their parents guardians and trustees. He accused western suggestions that such children had been adopted of being deliberately misleading adding In reality we are talking about temporary preliminary guardianship or temporary guardianship. The main goal is for children to be in families not in orphanages. This form was chosen specifically taking into account the potential reunification of minors with their blood relatives if any are found.

Reuters reports Speaking at an annual address to lawmakers and government officials Lukashenko said Moscows plans to station nuclear arms in Belarus would help safeguard the country which he said was under threat from the west.

Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus its first deployment of nuclear armaments outside its borders since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Lukashenko went further saying he and the Russian president could decide if necessary to deploy strategic nuclear weapons  more powerful systems that can destroy whole cities from a range of thousands of miles  on Belarusian soil. Belarus said this week that the Russian tactical nuclear weapons would offer protection after what it called a campaign of pressure from the United States and its allies aimed at overthrowing Lukashenko who has been in power for nearly three decades. I am not trying to intimidate or blackmail anyone. I want to safeguard the Belarusian state and ensure peace to the Belarusian people Lukashenko said.

The countrys opposition leader in exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the move grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian presidents suggestions that the move would not breach nonproliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov the head of Ukraines national security and defence council called the deal a step towards internal destabilisation of Belarus and said it maximised what he termed the level of negative perception and public rejection of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage he wrote on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak another senior adviser to Ukraines president Volodymyr Zelenskiy mocked Putins plan saying the Russian leader was too predictable. Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus he admits that he is afraid of losing  all he can do is scare with tactics Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. Nato spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday Russias nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russias nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russias reference to Natos nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments. Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats or escalated nuclear rhetoric after the full invasion of Ukraine but this is the first time he has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko who he said had long raised the question of a nuclear deployment on his countrys territory. Earlier in the week Putin threatened a response to Britains announcement that it would supply Ukraine with armourpiercing tank shells made with depleted uranium and mentioned the shells again in his remarks on Saturday but his justification of the move rested mainly on the presence of about 100 US nuclear bombs in Europe. There is nothing unusual here either firstly the United States has been doing this for decades Putin said. They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries. We agreed that we will do the same without violating our obligations  I emphasise without violating our international obligations on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Lukashenko staged a referendum in February last year revoking Belaruss nonnuclear status but the opposition rejected the vote as meaningless under conditions of political repression and following the 2020 presidential election that kept him in office generally agreed to have been rigged. Russias deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus directly violates the constitution of Belarus and grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to assume the nonnuclear state status expressed in the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus of 1990 Tsikhanouskaya said. This unacceptable development making Belarus a potential target for preventive or retaliation strikes became possible because of the illegal seizure of power by the illegitimate regime of Lukashenko. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Belarus it could face further sanctions if it hosted Russian nuclear weapons. Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions Borrell said in a tweet. Moscow has 5977 nuclear warheads in its inventory according to the Federation of American Scientists and has long had the capability to strike a target anywhere in the world. The US has slightly fewer at 5428. The Center for Arms Control and NonProliferation estimates that there are about 100 US nuclear weapons  airborne gravity bombs  stored in Europe across six bases in five countries although they are retained in US control. The US played down concerns about Putins announcement and the potential for Moscow to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance a senior US administration official said. The official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. Analysts at the Washingtonbased Institute for the Study of War ISW said in a note late on Saturday that the risk of escalation to nuclear war remained extremely low. They said ISW continues to assess that Putin is a riskaverse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through in order to break western resolve. However the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putins announcement an extremely dangerous escalation. In the context of the war in Ukraine the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences it said on Twitter. While the Belarusian army has not formally fought in Ukraine Minsk and Moscow have a close military relationship. Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine last year and the two nations stepped up joint military training. On Sunday Putin dismissed suggestions that Moscow was forging a military alliance with Beijing claiming instead that western powers were building a new axis similar to the partnership between Germany Italy and Japan during the second world war. We are not creating any military alliance with China Putin said on state television. Yes we have cooperation in the sphere of militarytechnical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent there is nothing secret. China and Russia signed a no limits partnership accord in early 2022 weeks before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Beijing has refrained from criticising Putins decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine. The Russian president named Australia New Zealand and South Korea as being in line to join a global Nato and referenced a defence agreement signed by Britain and Japan earlier this year. That is why western analysts  are talking about the west starting to build a new axis similar to the one created in the 1930s by the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy and militarist Japan Putin said. His words reflect his ongoing attempt to suggest that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that its western supporters are hellbent on menacing Russia. Ukraine which was part of the Soviet Union and was subjected to devastation at the hands of Hitlers forces has consistently rejected those parallels as spurious pretexts for a war of imperial conquest. Reuters contributed to this report,Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into a nuclear hostage after Vladimir Putins announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The countrys opposition leader in exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said the move grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian presidents suggestions that the move would not breach nonproliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov the head of Ukraines national security and defence council called the deal a step towards internal destabilisation of Belarus and said it maximised what he termed the level of negative perception and public rejection of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society.

A German diplomat said Lodge  the secretarygeneral of the International Seabed Authority ISA  has a duty of neutrality and has overstepped his role in resisting measures put forward by some council members that could slow down approval of the first mining proposals according to the New York Times. Furthermore in a tweet referencing the story Gina Guilln Grillo Costa Ricas representative to the seabed authority said yesterday Member states should drive the International Seabed Authority. Decisions must come from them  must not be pushed by those who have only administrative duties. Mining the seabed cannot be rushed because of the economic interests of a few. The criticism of Lodge comes at a crucial juncture as the body is expected to receive an application for commercial seabed mining later this year. The authority which is meeting in Jamaica this week is still writing regulations that would govern the process. Germany and Costa Rica are among the increasing number of countries  including France Spain Chile New Zealand and several Pacific nations  that have recently said they do not believe there is enough available data to evaluate the impact of mining on marine life. They have called for a precautionary pause or a ban on mining in the high seas. Lodge has previously suggested environmental impacts from deep sea mining are predictable and manageable. The German government sent a letter to Lodge last week expressing its concerns. In the letter Franziska Brantner Germanys minister for economic affairs and climate action said It is not the task of the secretariat to interfere in the decision making. In the past you have actively taken a stand against positions and decisionmaking proposals from individual delegations. Brantner added that the German government is seriously concerned about this approach. In a reply to Brantner the next day Lodge described those complaints as a bold and unsubstantiated allegation without facts or evidence. Lodge said his job was to make sure the authority respects the legal framework of the law of the sea. He said his opening remarks on 8 March did not refer to any specific proposal by any delegation but were fully consistent with the competencies recognised to me and that it was false to suggest he had in the past taken positions opposing proposals from delegates. This is untrue and I reject such a baseless allegation he said. He asked the German delegation to respect him and his staff and not seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Lodge made a statement to the New York Times saying that he places high importance on the preservation and protection of the marine environment and that he is working to ensure that decision making processes around economic activity in the deep seabed is based on best available scientific knowledge. The row is a measure of growing tensions over who controls the agency amid pressure from some UN nations to slow down ocean mining while others want it to go ahead. Duncan Currie an international legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition and an official observer at the 8 March meeting told the Guardian This is not just a row between diplomats. It is very significant. The executive organ is the council. It is not for the administrative body to be telling the council what decisions they should be making. The debate has heightened in recent months because the The Metals Company a Canadian mining startup has said it intends to request approval this year to start mining as soon as 2024. The small Pacific island country of Nauru is one of three states sponsoring The Metals Company along with the Kingdom of Tonga and the Republic of Kiribati. In 2021 Nauru triggered a twoyear rule that obliges the ISA to finalise and adopt regulations for commercial mining by July 2023. According to a memo sent by the Republic of Nauru if the ISA has not finalised regulations within the time frame and a mining application has been submitted then the authority should nonetheless consider and provisionally approve it allowing for extraction to go ahead. However some authority members believe the agency is under no obligation to approve an application from The Metals Company and Nauru until the regulations are complete. Diplomats were called to a virtual meeting on 8 March to discuss what to do if a mining application was indeed sent this year. As reported by the New York Times some delegates suggested revisions to the permitting process that would strengthen the councils ability to block the start of mining. However according to a copy of his prepared remarks Lodge warned delegates not to change established procedures. It would be dangerous to disturb this balance he said. We should let the system work as it is intended to do. Lodge said he did not intend to challenge any delegations proposals. But his remarks were interpreted that way by Germany Costa Rica and France the New York Times said. A spokesperson for the ISA told the Guardian The role of the secretariat is not to pass judgment on the position of member states but to facilitate negotiations and ensure that discussions are informed by the best available science and in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1994 agreement. The secretariat carries out this mission carefully deliberately and to the best of its abilities. The spokesperson added The regulations will only be approved should ISAs members reach a consensus on its content. In the meantime only exploration activities will be permitted.,Michael Lodge a British lawyer and the head of the UNaffiliated body responsible for governing mining in the high seas has been criticised by diplomats who claim he has been pushing them to accelerate the start of deepsea mining.

He announced his first South Korea squad this month at the countrys National Football Centre in Paju where buses pass moments before unloading tourists into Odusan Unification Tower to look through big binoculars into North Korea. The German will become used to the drive southeast passing Seoul World Cup Stadium in about 30 minutes and then soon after traffic permitting arriving in the middle of the capital and turning right into a secluded street and a swanky neighbourhood of trendy restaurants expensive wine bars and the headquarters of the Korean Football Association. The journey from the edge of the demilitarised zone to downtown Seoul is a short one but the two worlds are very different. Perhaps travelling regularly up and down that corridor helps explain why Klinsmanns compatriot and predecessor Uli Stielike found it hard to separate his team from the countrys unique situation. There is no peace agreement between North and South Korea so the country is on constant alert Stielike said in an interview in Germany when asked to offer advice to Klinsmann. This caution is of course reflected in the character of the people including in football. They defend quite well because they have the discipline will coordination and toughness required. On the offensive however there is a lack of creativity and risktaking. That certainly was the case when Stielike was in charge of South Korea from 201417 and while few would argue that creative attacking play is a longstanding strength of Korean football connecting that to the 75year division of the peninsula did not go down well in Seoul. After all while Korea may be alone in division they have plenty of Asian company when it comes to struggles going forward. Ultimately though it matters little whether Klinsmann buys into his compatriots theory or not he can ascribe whatever cause he wants for the problem as long as he finds a solution. Perhaps that is why Klinsmann talked up his penchant for exciting attacking football in his first press conference. Obviously my personal background was as a striker. So I always love to attack and that means Id rather win a game 43 than 10. As well as saying the right things the 58yearold also smiled more in one press conference than Stielike or Paulo Bento who finished a fouryear tenure at the World Cup managed across their respective tenures. Klinsmanns first squad is very similar to the one that Bento took to Qatar and squeezed somewhat fortuitously into the last 16 with a lastminute win over Portugal. With a threeandahalf year contract there is time for the German to get to know the KLeague and the players in action in Japan the Middle East and Europe. It starts for him against Colombia on Friday and then against Uruguay four days later. South Korea celebrate reaching the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar. Photograph Ian MacNicolGetty Images The announcement that the head coachs job had gone to Klinsmann did not get the universal acclaim the Korea Football Association who selected another German in Michael Mller to find Bentos replacement probably wanted and expected. The days when big names were automatically feted have gone. Klinsmann has a worldclass CV as a player but fans and journalists have questions about his coaching credentials. Taking Germany to the semi finals of the World Cup on home soil in 2006 something largely credited to his assistant Joachim Lw  was followed by a spell in charge of Bayern Munich that ended after nine months. Five years with the United States were up and down and then there was an illfated 76 dayspell in charge of Hertha Berlin in 201920. It is a mixed bag especially for a man who has had little more than two months coaching experience in more than six years. Much of the announcement press conference involved Mller defending the new coach. Football is not only tactics. Football is individuality. Its about teamwork how to motivate your team in special situations he said. Klinsmann was a member of the Technical Study Group of the World Cup. He is not only informed about tactics he is informed about modern devices tools and match analysis. Jrgen Klinsmann absolutely has tactical abilities. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Stielike did not get great results but was well liked in the KFA attending football and nonfootball events with enthusiasm a trait that goes down well. It remains to be seen if Klinsmann can offer the same commitment and enthusiasm. Coaches of South Korea have traditionally been judged on World Cup qualification and the KFA can be ruthless when that looks to be in jeopardy. And the policy can be deemed to have largely worked given 1982 was the last time the Taeguk Warriors failed to reach the finals. There is a growing sense however that there needs to be something more especially with their rivals Japan pulling ahead. Reaching the 2026 World Cup finals should prove straightforward for South Korea given Asias increased allocation of places from four to eight which in turn eases the pressure on Klinsmann somewhat. But that may make the more nebulous task of leaving a legacy more difficult. If Klinsmann succeeds it is not only Korea that moves to the next level but also his own coaching reputation.,After a career spent in Europe and North America Jrgen Klinsmann is now in Asia.

Leon Smiths side qualified for the group stage by defeating Colombia 31 away in February. The 2015 champions will look to perform better on home soil than last September in Glasgow when defeats against the USA and the Netherlands saw Great Britain fail to reach the Final 8 knockout competition which was won by Canada. Britains top three singles players Cameron Norrie Dan Evans and Jack Draper were all called up for the Colombia tie  which was on clay at altitude with pressureless balls  alongside doubles specialists Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury. It remains to be seen whether Smith will recall Andy Murray to the squad for the Group B encounter back in Manchester or hand another chance to 21yearold Draper who recently beat the veteran Scot in the last 32 at Indian Wells. Australias challenge is likely to be led by world No 18 Alex de Minaur and Wimbledon runnerup Nick Kyrgios. France  who last won the Davis Cup in 2017 and were runnersup the following year  will have veteran Richard Gasquet as their topranked singles player. Threetime grand slam champion and 2014 Davis Cup winner Stan Wawrinka will bring his experience to the Swiss team having helped them upset Germany in the qualifiers. Elsewhere in the draw the defending champions Canada are top seeds in Group A and will play in Bologna against hosts Italy Sweden and Chile. Group C will be in Valencia where the worlds current top two Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are set to meet when Spain take on Serbia with the Czech Republic and South Korea completing the lineup. Croatia will host Group D at a venue still to be confirmed against the Netherlands USA and Finland. The winners and runnersup from each group will advance to a sixday shootout for the trophy in Mlaga during late November. Alcaraz and Rybakina target Sunshine Double Carlos Alcaraz and Elena Rybakina stayed on course to complete the Sunshine Double with both Indian Wells champions advancing at the Miami Open. Alcaraz beat Tommy Paul 64 64 to book a quarterfinal against another American player Taylor Fritz who defeated Denmarks Hlger Rune 63 64. Rybakina notched up her 12th straight win thrashing Martina Trevisan 63 60 to reach the semifinals.

In the mens draw Stefanos Tsitsipas was sent packing by Russias Karen Khachanov who won 76 74 64 in the fourth round to end a 23match winless run against a top10 opponent. Khachanov will next face Argentinas Francisco Cerndolo while Daniil Medvedev will face home hopeful Christopher Eubanks in the last eight.

Until then referendums had always been about the future. But the moment arrived when the horizon closed and we started to only look back towards the past. A referendum on the past would involve choosing to return to the happiest decade or year from the 20th century in each nations history. A deficit of future always unlocks huge reserves of nostalgia for the past which decade would nations choose? Germany picks the very end of the 80s a perpetuum mobile of 1989 in which the wall is constantly falling. Italy goes back to the 60s. Its as if the map of Europe shifts from territorial to temporal and nations close themselves up  for a very short while  inside their own happy past. We are seeing this model  this strong pull backwards  being played out now. In short time has replaced space. The world has been parcelled out more or less explored and familiar. We are left with an immense ocean of time which is really an ocean of the past. The very idea of nostalgia has changed. No longer focused on a place or home nostos as the etymology of the word suggests nostalgia now is for a different time. Perhaps we should use some other term  chronostalgia for example. And in this sense our wars have become wars for the past. When the novel came out at one reading the audience asked me OK but what would Russia choose? At the time I wasnt sure. I would like to think it would be the Gorbachev years the time of perestroika. The answer came on 24 February last year. In this invisible referendum on the past Russia chose the years of the second world war the last time they enjoyed the recognition of a world prepared to forget Stalin the gulags the Holodomor and the cruelties of the Soviet system. Putin has chosen understandably to return to the early 1940s. Russias current unhappiness and isolation have made it turn back towards the happy and powerful times of the Soviet Union. In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany did What Putin wants is not to win this war but to make it chronic to force us all to live in that regime. His goal is to bombard and raze the present and the future with all its infrastructure and everydayness  so that there is no water no warmth no light. To destroy everyday life and from there existence as well to literally annihilate the Ukrainian nation. An aggressive project to revive the past especially an unprocessed forgotten or rewritten past is the perfect breeding ground for populism and nationalism. We saw this under Trump and now it is coming true in an even more sinister guise under Putin. Memory and culture are part of Europes immune system. It must recognise and disarm the viruses of collective blindness loss of reason nationalistic madness and the birth of new dictators. But the Ukraine war has broken out as those who carry the living memory of the second world war are no longer with us. We are on that generational precipice when the last of the participants who kept that memory alive the last concentration camp prisoners the last soldiers are passing away. I hope we are not heading towards some strange collective Alzheimers. Because when the flame of memory goes out the beasts of the past close the circle around us. The less memory the more past. We remember so as to hold the past at bay  in the past. It is no longer a question merely of memory but of what we remember and how. Because Putin too swears by memory. Populism and nationalism also create their own version of memory. In Russia they never did the hard work around the memory of the second world war that Germany for example did the painful work that penetrates all layers of society enters into institutions schools and history textbooks. Its absence keeps alive Russias status as the great victim an alibi for new sacrifices it feels it deserves. One of the most disturbing things now is the erasure of the boundary between truth and fakeness. This fakeness not only rewrites the past but predetermines the future. It grounds itself in a revised past precisely to justify current aggressions and infamies. Throughout my entire childhood and youth in Bulgaria I was taught in school that Russia was our big brother whom we could not do without like all older brothers he could beat up the bad kids in the neighbourhood who bullied us. Of course my generation secretly dreamed of other nations of those yearned for foreign lands to the west of us. And this is some small justice  the USSR never became a dream destination despite the propaganda instead it remained a place we held in awe. And this has consequences for the current situation.

Photograph Sergei ChuzavkovSopa ImagesRexShutterstock In Bulgaria today proRussian propaganda works easily on various levels. From feelings of gratitude to our twotime liberators and as it turns out our twotime enslavers through veneration for Russian culture as if Putin and Chekhov were twin brothers to statements by highranking politicians who refuse to unambiguously take the side of the victim. A Eurobarometer poll from May of last year indicates that public opinion in Bulgaria is closer than that of other EU countries to the Russian position on the war. Bulgaria is also in last place in the EU for media literacy. Facebook remains the most influential social media in Bulgaria more than 95 of our traffic is there. The problem is that propaganda from the internet has penetrated official and serious media as well. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans  from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

I dont think the country has seen such disintegration and polarisation  made worse by social networks and public figures  in decades. It may sound too harsh but sometimes I get the feeling that we are on the verge of a quiet civil war. This part of Europe has not been on the crest of the wave of history since 1989. But it has never ceased through its literatureand stories to offer warnings about what has already happened and could happen again. It seems to me that these stories have not been heard well enough. Here we can clearly sense that history is not yet finished. Now we know and can formulate it as long as there is a single bleeding wound of history on the continent the entire continent bleeds. No one no matter how many kilometres to the west they may be can rest easy. The centre of Europe is not something static stuck in Berlin or Paris. The centre of Europe is that mobile point of pain. Where it hurts and bleeds. Today it is in the east in proud Ukraine. In one of the most beautiful essays about Europe A Kidnapped West written during the cold war 1983 Milan Kundera begins with a final desperate telex message sent by the director of the Hungarian news agency in 1956 while the building itself was under artillery fire. His message read We are going to die for Hungary and for Europe. In those critical minutes he wanted to communicate something. The Russian armys invasion of Hungary was an invasion of Europe dont wait react. Did Europe or the west back then receive and decipher the message? This time we know for whom the bell tolls. People in Europe understood immediately. Kunderas essay ends with the bitter conclusion that after the second world war the west turned away from central Europe and simply thought of it as a satellite of the Soviet empire without its own identity. This inertia I dare say continued even after 1989. The war in Ukraine has actually returned central and eastern Europe to Europe. From the periphery there is a hypersensitivity to what is impending an ability to pick up the scent of alarm in the air. Eastern Europe has learned to sense danger with its skin. For this reason I will allow myself to put it this way dont underestimate the books essays and poems from this corner of Europe. Decode the symbols in them. Words dont stop tanks and dont down drones. But they can cant they? stop delay or at least cause those in the tanks who make war on innocent people hesitate at least for a bit. Words can help those who are deluded by fake news and propaganda. This war will not end with the last bullet fired. It began years before the first shot and is likely to end years after the final one. But literature has a role at the very least it can teach us resistance and empathy it can offer us the tools with which to identify propaganda lies it can preserve personal stories from the epicentre of pain generate memory that will not be violated and if possible console. No propaganda should be stronger than the memory of a little boy fleeing from war with a telephone number scrawled on his arm.,Four years ago I wrote a novel in which the feeling that there was a deficit of future was so acute that every nation in Europe wanted to hold its own referendum on the past. Until then referendums had always been about the future. But the moment arrived when the horizon closed and we started to only look back towards the past. A referendum on the past would involve choosing to return to the happiest decade or year from the 20th century in each nations history.,Four years ago I wrote a novel in which the feeling that there was a deficit of future was so acute that every nation in Europe wanted to hold its own referendum on the past.

It was a job to which he had seemed destined since becoming the youngest coach in Bundesliga history in 2016 taking charge of Hoffenheim at the age of 29. He had already led Hoffenheims under19s to the Bundesliga youth title. He seemed preternaturally gifted and in Germany the gifted always end up at Bayern especially when they come from Bavaria. Taking over with Hoffenheim seven points adrift Nagelsmann inspired them to unlikely survival and the following season took them into the Champions League. After a thirdplace finish in 2017 18 Nagelsmanns upward journey continued at RB Leipzig as he took them to the Champions League semifinals. A Bundesliga title in his first season at Bayern may have been expected but his first silverware was no less welcome for that. And yet and yet  Leipzigs 30 defeat by Thomas Tuchels Paris SaintGermain in that onelegged Champions League semifinal in 2020 was damaging. They were flat from start to finish devoid of the aggression shown against Atltico Madrid and Tottenham in the previous rounds. PSG have habitually been rattled by hardpressing opponents and their starry but lackadaisical forward line means they can be overwhelmed in midfield. Leipzig though were so timorous that the extraordinary trousers sported by Nagelsmann that night came to seem compensatory. Its one game. Failures can happen particularly when a team are playing on a stage they have never previously reached. But it fitted a pattern Nagelsmann faltering in big games against non German opposition. It began when Hoffenheim were drawn against Liverpool in a Champions League playoff in 201718. A potentially awkward tie for Liverpool was won more comfortably than a 63 aggregate suggests. Leipzig didnt put up much of a challenge against them in the last 16 in 202021 either. It is true Leipzig were underdogs in all those games but the issue is less the defeats than the tame manner of them. Then last season Bayern were eliminated by Villarreal in the Champions League quarterfinals. Obviously if you focus only on a managers defeats he looks bad. And the sample size is small. But this is the nature of modern German football particularly for a Bayern coach when the title is all but assured. Europe is the only stage where honour can be won and Nagelsmann is yet to do that. That said Bayern have won eight out of eight in the Champions League this season eliminating PSG but even in the first leg of the last 16 there was a sense of opportunity lost. A manager more in tune with the emotional flow of the game might have seized on PSGs dismal first half would have recognised their midfield domination and grasped the moment rather than diligently retaining possession. As it was Bayern survived a late wobble after Kylian Mbapp had come on and although they ended up going through comfortably that lack of ruthlessness needlessly offered PSG a route back into the game. Julian Nagelsmanns Bayern Munich eliminated PSG from the Champions League but they lacked ruthlessness. Photograph Stefan MatzkesampicsCorbisGetty Images There is something preposterous about this. There is an absurdity to a manager being sacked having lost three of 36 games this season. But that is the reality of modern German football. Bayerns annual revenues are 83 higher than those of their nearest rivals and in that sense Nagelsmann is just as much a victim of Germanys financial divisions as Hansa Rostock or Arminia Bielefeld. Winning isnt enough there must be domination and there must be panache. After the World Cup said Bayerns chief executive Oliver Kahn we have played less successfully and less attractively. Its not just performances that led to Nagelsmanns dismissal or even the defeats by Borussia Mnchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen that led to Bayern surrendering top spot. As doubts mounted he seemed less and less able to deal with the pressure. His hunt for the mole he claimed was leaking dressingroom information which led to the sacking of Bayerns popular longterm goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic came to seem paranoid. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

And so Nagelsmann thrust into coaching at the age of 20 by injury tipped for the top from an early age has lost his dream job. When Johan Cruyff having already managed Ajax was sacked by Barcelona in 1996 he declared time on his managerial career at the age 49 Nagelsmann is 35. Cruyff remained in Barcelona writing his newspaper columns the unofficial conscience of the club. But he had won four league titles  at a time when every championship really mattered for Barcelona  led them to their first European Cup and changed the parameters of how the world believed football could be played. Nagelsmann for all his promise has no such achievements. He will surely coach again. But where and with what enthusiasm? He has been linked with Real Madrid and Tottenham. But how would Nagelsmann who quite aside from his occasionally extravagant fashion choices has turned up to Bayern training on a skateboard and a HarleyDavidson motorcycle as though suffering a perpetual and premature midlife crisis fit within Madrids culture of seorio? How would club grandees react to his loud tracksuits and brash checks? Equally were he to turn up at Tottenham it would compared with Bayern and Madrid feel like a step down. Spurs have suffered enough with managers who have treated the job as though they were doing the club a favour. What they need is the equivalent of Mauricio Pochettino in 2014 a hungry manager on the way up not one no matter how young fighting for relevance perhaps eyeing ultimately a cathartic return to Bayern. That is Nagelsmanns great problem. At an age when many are still playing he has reached a crisis point in his managerial career. It may be his best years are already behind him. This is often the tragedy of wunderkinder gilded youth yields often to leaden middle age.,If only Julian Nagelsmann had never become manager of Bayern Munich the world might have believed he would be a very good manager of Bayern Munich.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/long-arm-of-the-law-trump-putin-lawrence-douglas,Is the long arm of the law finally catching up to Trump and Putin  Lawrence Douglas,These two men find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flaunt with impunityLets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict  4943 chars,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict Donald Trump. Admittedly the two cases are quite different. Putin is wanted for his role in orchestrating devastating war crimes. Trump stands accused of relatively minor crimes involving the payment of hush money to a former porn star. But there is a sense that these two men so recently bound in mutual admiration of their bullying contempt for democratic norms and legal process now find themselves in the clutches of the very systems of justice that they believed they could flout with impunity. Of course there is no guarantee that either man will ever be fully held to account. Those looking forward to the day of Putins reckoning before the ICC in The Hague should bear in mind that the only reason the allies succeeded in trying members of the Nazi leadership in Nuremberg was because Hitlers Germany lay in ruins. Putin remains very much in power and presides over an arsenal of 6000 nuclear warheads that he continues to recklessly brandish. Unless Putin finds himself ousted from power his arrest warrant will remain a symbolic reminder that in the eyes of international law the Russian leader is a pariah and a fugitive. Trump and Putin are both now legally if not politically cornered No such evasions will be possible for Trump. And yet the very legal system that Trump defames as hopelessly corrupt demands that an indictment have a coherent legal basis and that guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is possible then that a court could dismiss the New York charges or should the case go forward the trial result in an acquittal. Which is why I believe those interested in seeing Trump brought to justice should look past this indictment  based on an untested legal theory and involving a constellation of tawdry wrongdoings  and train their attention on Fulton county Georgia where Trump faces likely indictment for soliciting election fraud. Or else look to the Department of Justice which continues to investigate Trump for his actions culminating in the January 6 insurrection and for his refusal to hand over classified documents illegally stored at his MaraLago residence. These investigations particularly in Georgia and over January 6 involve far weightier allegations of criminal wrongdoing allegations less vulnerable to attack as simply an exercise in political scoresettling. Not that Trump and his minions wont malign any attempt to hold the former president and active candidate to account as the greatest witchhunt in human history. Commenting on the indictment Tucker Carlson apocalyptically told his viewers Probably not the best time to give up your AR15. Perhaps not coincidentally his words echoed those of Margarita Simonyan the head of RT channel who responded to the ICCs warrant with the observation Id like to see the country that arrests Putin  eight minutes later. Or whatever the flight time to its capital is  presumably referring to the time it would take a Russian nuclear warhead to reduce the targeted city to smoldering cinders. Trump and Putin are both now legally if not politically cornered. If they first were joined by their adherence to a politics of ethnonationalist authoritarianism now what they have in common is their pursuit of a denuded politics of destruction. With Putins dreams of military triumph and a restoration of Russian imperial glory dashed in the early hours of the invasion the Russian leader now appears without strategy and goals except to make Ukraine pay for his misbegotten aggression with death and ruination. If Trump were a man of restraint he would not find himself in the legal peril he now faces As for Trump even some of his sycophants in Fox News had begun to ruefully observe that since declaring his candidacy the former president has offered no political vision or plan except to present himself as the sum of all political grievance and as the avenging sword of his militant supporters as they wage the final battle against the fanciful forces aligned against them. Putin has clearly demonstrated his taste for violence. Trump has done so on one fateful occasion. When first anticipating indictment Trump cajoled his supporters to PROTEST and to TAKE OUR NATION BACK!  words that recalled his incitements on 6 January 2021. He has not since repeated that demand. But as the wheels of justice turn it is hard to imagine Trump continuing to exercise anything that resembles restraint. It is not in his DNA to do so. If Trump were a man of restraint  respectful of norms decency and the rule of law  he would not find himself in the legal peril he now faces. And so we can only hope that our nation and its justice system can absorb the barrage of attacks most likely to come.,Lets not ignore the poetic justice on 17 March the international criminal court ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin a scant two weeks later a grand jury in New York voted to indict Donald Trump.
