Printed under the masthead of Polizei Berlin the letter outlined criminal charges They had unlawfully shared porn on the internet. The onepage letter is distinctly vague. It doesnt say where on the internet they were accused of sharing pornography illegally nor which specific law they have broken. The couple who for the past six years have run an amateur porn project alongside their day jobs called the police to find out what was going on. An investigator told the couple that the police had found porn on their Twitter account Tim says. The police had screenshots of the material and crucially had identified a lack of measures to prevent children from potentially seeing the adult content. As a result the couple could face a fine of thousands of euros. The Blesh couple isnt alone. In recent weeks more than a hundred porn creators and models in Germany have received identical letters and face criminal proceedings. The letters and police action signal an escalation in Germanys porn crackdown and come as authorities are using an artificial intelligence system to detect pornography. Regulators have developed an AI system dubbed KIVI to spot pornography and offensive content on Twitter TikTok YouTube Telegram and morescanning thousands of public posts and web pages per day. Pornography isnt illegal in Germany but in recent years the nations media authorities have been taking action against pornography that is not protected by age verification technologies which require people to prove they are over 18 before they can see any adult photos or videos. Officials have ordered Twitter to block accounts and tried to impose a block on one of the worlds biggest porn websites for the entire German population. WIRED spoke with three separate Berliners who had received police letters about their posted material. They say the tactics have scared them into not sharing content. They have deleted thousands of tweets and say they feel censored. I feel ashamed sometimes says one person who asked not to be named so they dont damage their ongoing case. Thats having a psychological impact on me they say adding All I wanted to do is express my sexuality. Censored and Scared In Germany the Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media KJM is responsible for protecting children online. Under the body are 14 state media authorities which are responsible for individual regions. The countrys laws say it is illegal to make pornography accessible to someone who is under 18. In Germany the distribution of pornography on the internet is only permitted in closed user groups with prior age verification says a spokesperson for the North RhineWestphalia media authority. The agency has been at the forefront of the action against online pornography and critics say it is led by those with conservative views. Since this is not the case on Twitter the distribution of pornography via Twitter in its current form is not permitted in Germany the spokesperson says. Many of the recent police reports relate to porn being shared on Twitter and stem from Berlins Media Authority. Tim Blesh says he knows around 10 gay creators who have been targeted recentlysome have received notices from Twitter saying their accounts break German laws and content should be removed while others have gotten the letters from police. After receiving the letter and calling the police for more information Blesh says the couple contacted a lawyer and are now waiting for the police to formally provide evidence of potential wrongdoing. Blesh believes they are likely to receive a fine but it is also possible that any of the cases could end up in court.,The last thing Tim and Julian Blesh expected when they got home from traveling at the start of March was a letter from the police.

The 55yearold German served eight months of his twoandahalfyear sentence for hiding 2.5m worth of assets and loans to avoid paying debts. He was released in December and was subsequently deported from the UK. Im usually good in the fifth set  Ive won the first two sets Ive lost the next two and Im planning to win that he told 5 Live Breakfast. In a lengthy interview former world number one Becker said There was no handbook for dealing with fame and fortune after winning Wimbledon as a teenager Prison was brutal and a very different experience to what you see in the movies Hes a stronger better man after eight months in prison The full interview will be played on Saturdays 5 Live Breakfast show. Whoever says prison life isnt hard is lying The sixtime Grand Slam singles champion who was catapulted to stardom in 1985 when he won Wimbledon aged just 17 was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act in April last year. The case centred on Beckers bankruptcy in June 2017 resulting from an unpaid loan of more than 3m on his luxury estate in Mallorca Spain. Speaking before the release of a new TV documentary about his life and career Boom! Boom! The World vs Boris Becker Becker said I dont think there was a handbook written for how to behave what to do and how to live your life when you win Wimbledon at 17. The fame and fortune after was very new. Obviously I never studied business I never studied finance and after my tennis career I made a couple of decisions probably badly advised but again it was my decision. Becker is the youngest ever champion of the mens singles at Wimbledon winning the 1985 title aged 17 After sentencing Becker spent the first weeks of his detention at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London before spending the majority of his sentence at Huntercombe Prison in Oxfordshire. Whoever says that prison life isnt hard and isnt difficult I think is lying the threetime Wimbledon champion said. I was surrounded by murderers by drug dealers by rapists by people smugglers by dangerous criminals. You fight every day for survival. Quickly you have to surround yourself with the tough boys as I would call it because you need protection. Becker said being a legendary tennis player counted for nothing while he was in prison. If you think youre better than everybody else then you lose he said. Inside it doesnt matter that I was a tennis player the only currency we have inside is our character and our personality. Thats it you have nothing else. You dont have any friends at first youre literally on your own and thats the hard part you have to really dig inside yourself about your qualities and your strengths but also your weaknesses. I miss London Following his release Becker was deported to Germany and will not be allowed to return to UK soil until October 2024. I miss London I really miss Wimbledon and I wont be going there this year he said Im fortunate that I can stand on my feet none of my partners have dropped me theyve welcomed me back home. When youre down and the last five six years were very difficult for me you truly find out whos with you and whos not with you. Speaking about how he has been received by people since his release he said Nobodys perfect including myself and Ive accepted all of that. Ive been out now for three and a half months and Im very humbled again by the reception Ive received from fans from people on the street from people who have followed the story a little bit. Becker has commentated at Wimbledon for the BBC The former BBC pundit says he has been in dialogue with the BBC about being part of its Wimbledon coverage in the future. Ive told them I cant come back next year Becker said. If Im allowed to go back I will make a phone call and ask if they want me back on the team I would certainly love to but its not my decision. Im a stronger better man Becker believes he has learned valuable lessons from his time in prison. I never thought at 17 Id be incarcerated at 54 he said. If anything it certainly humbled me it certainly made me realise that whether youre called Boris Becker or Paul Smith if you break the law you get convicted and you get incarcerated that goes for everybody. I never expected the good and I certainly didnt expect the bad but Im a survivor Im a tough cookie Ive taken the penalties Ive taken the incarceration but Ive also taken the glory and if anything this made me a stronger better man. With my decisions in the future you can see whether I have learned from it or I didnt.,Last updated on .From the section Tennis Becker humbled by brutal spell in prison Tennis great Boris Becker says he is building his lifes third chapter following his release from prison.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. CNN  Tonight Jews around the world will gather around the seder table to celebrate Passover. They will recount the miraculous story of the Jewish peoples exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom. It is a timeless powerful story of faith hope and redemption that has inspired oppressed people everywhere for generations. President Joe Biden Adam SchultzUS Navy But Passover is more than just a recounting of the past. It is also a cautionary tale of the present and our future as a democracy. As Jews read from the Haggadah about how evil in every generation has tried to destroy them antisemitism is rising to record levels today. According to the FBI more than half of religious hate crimes in America in 2021 targeted Jews and were motivated by antisemitism. The AntiDefamation League similarly found that in 2022 antisemitic incidents in America reached their highest levels on record since it started tracking incidents more than 40 years ago. We see this evil across society. Terrorist attacks on synagogues. Bricks thrown through windows of Jewish businesses. Antisemitic flyers left on the front lawns of Jewish homes. Swastikas on cars and cemeteries. Antisemitic graffiti and acts in elementary middle and high schools. Jewish students harassed on college campuses. Jews wearing religious attire beaten and shot on streets. Failure to call out hate is complicityAnd we will not be silent. Joe Biden Antisemitic conspiracy theories rampant online. Antisemitic tropes treated as honest public debate. Celebrities spouting antisemitic hate. All of it  flagrant embraces of extremism in public life. These acts are unconscionable and despicable. They carry in them terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in human history. And theyre not only a strike against Jews theyre also a threat to other minority communities and a stain on the soul of our nation. To the Jewish community I want you to know that I see your fear your hurt and your concern that this venom is being normalized. I decided to run for President after I saw it in Charlottesville when neoNazis marched from the shadows spewing the same antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the 1930s. Rest assured that I am committed to the safety of the Jewish people. I stand with you. America stands with you. Under my presidency we continue to condemn antisemitism at every turn. Failure to call out hate is complicity. Silence is complicity. And we will not be silent. As the Passover holiday teaches our work starts with the sacred duty to remember. Last year I visited Israel once again to reaffirm Americas unshakeable commitment to its security. I returned to Yad Vashem to honor the 6 million murdered Jews to keep alive the truth and horror of the Holocaust and to remind us all of our shared responsibility to make real the promise of Never Again. It was a promise my father first instilled in me at our family dinner table educating my siblings and me about the horrors of the Shoah. Its a lesson Ive passed on to my own children and grandchildren by taking them to Dachau a concentration camp in Nazi Germany to understand for themselves the depths of this evil and the culpability of indifference. And its a message that Jill and I have continued along with Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff by bringing Holocaust survivors to the White House and to the State of the Union  so the entire nation bears witness. But Passover teaches that remembering is not enough we must also speak out. The word Haggadah means telling  and it reminds us of our moral obligation to state clearly and forcefully that this scourge of antisemitism must stop. Thats why I appointed Deborah Lipstadt  a Holocaust expert  as our first Ambassadorlevel Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat AntiSemitism around the world. The Second Gentleman  the first Jewish spouse of a vice president in our history  has also been a leading voice against antisemitism and visited Poland and Germany to promote Holocaust awareness. And I hosted the first United We Stand Summit at the White House convening governmental and nongovernmental leaders from across the country to declare that hatefueled violence can have no safe harbor in America. But as we speak out we must also act. Central to the seder are actions rituals and reenactments that help us feel the exodus experience and collectively reinforce the truth that words alone are insufficient. Thats why I signed a bipartisan law to help state and local law enforcement better identify and respond to hate crimes. And the Justice Department has made combating hate crimes one of its top priorities. My administration also secured the largestever increase in funding for the physical security of nonprofits including synagogues Jewish community centers and Jewish day schools. Because nobody should have to fear walking down the street wearing symbols of their faith. Well also be releasing the firstever national strategy to counter antisemitism which will outline comprehensive actions the federal government will undertake and that reflects input from over a thousand Jewish community stakeholders faith and civil rights leaders state and local officials and more. Taking action also means reinforcing that Jewish culture and values are essential to the fabric of America. Thats why we hosted the first High Holiday reception at the White House and lit the first permanent White House Hanukkah menorah in our nations history. From darkness we find joy and hope and light. Joe Biden But government alone cannot root out antisemitism and hate. All Americans including businesses and community leaders educators students athletes entertainers and influencers must help confront bigotry in all its forms. We must each do our part to create a culture of respect in our workplaces in our schools on our social media and in our homes. Because hate never goes away it only hides until it is given just a little oxygen. And it is our obligation to ensure that hate doesnt grow or become normalized. It is our duty to preserve and protect the sacred ideals enshrined in our Constitution religious freedom equality dignity and respect. That is the promise of America. And that is the story of Passover  a story of redemption resilience and unity. A story of people coming together with a shared faith a shared hope for a better tomorrow and a shared resolve to reach the Promised Land. We were reminded of this enduring story in the aftermath of the hostagetaking at a synagogue in Colleyville Texas last year. Hate did not pierce a communitys goodness and grace. Heroic law enforcement officials were joined by local faith leaders including an imam and Baptist minister who offered their help. The nearby Catholic Church opened its doors to the hostages families. At sunset a group of Muslim women friends of the rabbis wife arrived with the rabbis favorite foods. They hugged and wept and held strong together. Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinions newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Thats the America that I know. From darkness we find joy and hope and light. Rather than driving us apart faith can move us together. Not just faith in a higher power but faith to see each other as we should  as fellow human beings. As we celebrate Passover let us reflect that like the four children in the Haggadah despite our differences we sit at the same table as one people one nation one America. Let us join hands across faiths races and backgrounds to make clear that evil will not win hate will not prevail and antisemitism will not be the story of our time. Let us remember speak out and act to restore the soul of America together.,Editors Note Joe Biden is President of the United States. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

Ferencz fought in Europe during the Second World War and helped liberate several concentration camps before turning to the courtroom. At 27 he was named Chief Prosecutor for Nurembergs Einsatzgruppen trial trying 22 Nazis for crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg trials were held by the Allies after Germany was defeated in 1945 with an aim to bring Nazis to justice for crimes committed during World War II. The Einsatzgruppen trial was his first court case but the evidence which Ferencz discovered perfectly recorded and documented in Nazi headquarters allowed him to successfully rest the case in only two days. The men on trial commanded Hitlers roaming SS extermination squads killing between them an estimated one million victims. Ferencz at his home in Delray Beach Florida in 2016. Brooks KraftGetty Images In his opening statement he said Vengeance is not our goal. Nor do we seek merely a just retribution. We ask this court to affirm by international penal action mans right to live in peace and dignity regardless of his race or creed. The case we present is a plea to humanity. All the defendents were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is often considered the biggest murder trials in history. Ferencz was the first prosecutor to use the term genocide in a court of law introducing the term in his opening statement So here the killing of defenseless civilians during a war may be a war crime but the same killings are part of another crime a graver one if you will genocide or a crime against humanity. This is the distinction we make in our pleading. It is real and most significant. For Ferencz law not war was more than a motto it was his lifes mission. For decades he advocated the establishment of an International Criminal Court and is considered one of the ICCs founding fathers. In 2011 he delivered the closing statement for the prosecution at the ICCs first trial saying What makes this Court so distinctive is its primary goal to deter crimes before they take place by letting wrongdoers know in advance that they will be called to account by an impartial International Criminal Court. Ferencz speaking with CNNs Christiane Amanpour. In January Ferencz was awarded the US Congressional Gold Medal but was unable to attend the ceremony due to his declining health. In an interview with CNNs Christiane Amanpour last year Ferencz said he was heartbroken by the war in Ukraine. To see it happening again very similar kids being shot homes being blown up it pains me to see that we have learned so little from the Holocaust and from the trials he said. Ferencz fought for justice his entire life saying to let the world continue to use war as an instrument of persuasion is so stupid and so incredible that I simply cant stop doing it at the age of 103. He added that he was not discouraged and to never give up never give up never give up.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/08/us/christianity-decline-easter-blake-cec/index.html,Analysis Predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature,Pundits in the US have been warning that Christianity is on the decline citing shrinking church membership and polls showing that fewer Americans call themselves Christians But some scholars say help is on the way,The cross and the empty tomb Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrecti 12068 chars,CNN  The cross and the empty tomb. Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story. One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrection and the claim that death does not have the final word on him or his followers. As millions of Americans celebrate the holiest day in the Christian calendar on Sunday most will hear some variation of this Easter message  finding new life in unforeseen places. But that message could also describe a surprising prediction about the future of Christianity in the US. For years church leaders and commentators have warned that Christianity is dying in America. They say the American church is poised to follow the path of churches in Western Europe soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews shuttered church buildings converted into skate parts and nightclubs and a secularized society where one theologian said Christianity as a norm is probably gone for good  or at least for the next 100 years. Yet when CNN asked some of the nations top religion scholars and historians recently about the future of Christianity in the US they had a different message. They said the American church is poised to find new life for one major reason Waves of Christians are migrating to the US. And they said the biggest challenge to Christianitys future in America is not declining numbers but the churchs ability to adapt to this migration. Joseph P. Slaughter a historian and assistant professor of religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut says people have been predicting the extinction of Christianity in the US for over two centuries and it hasnt happened yet. A sparsely attended Good Friday mass in Cologne Germany on April 2 2021. Ina FassbenderAFPGetty Images He pointed to Thomas Jefferson one of the nations founding fathers who predicted in the 1820s that Christianity would be replaced in the US by a more enlightened form of religion that rejected Jesus divinity and belief in miracles. Instead Jeffersons prophecy was followed by a series of revivals including the Second Great Awakening which swept across America and reasserted Christianity as a dominant force in American life. Id never bet against American Christianity  particularly evangelicalism Slaughter says and its ability to adapt and remain a significant shaper of the American society. Whats happening in Europe is the churchs nightmare scenario If one only looks at the numbers Slaughters optimism seems misguided. Virtually every recent poll about Christianity in America has been brutal for its followers. About 64 of Americans call themselves Christian today. That might sound like a lot but 50 years ago that number was 90 according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070. The Covid19 pandemic also hurt the church in America. Church attendance has rebounded recently but remains slightly below prepandemic levels. A 2021 Gallup poll revealed another grim number for Christians church membership in the US has fallen below 50 for the first time. In addition a cascade of headlines in recent years have stained the churchs reputation including sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention the spread of White Christian nationalism and the perception that the church oppresses marginalized groups such as LGBTQ people. Church leaders in the US also have fretted about the rise of nones. These are people who describe themselves as atheists agnostics or nothing in particular when asked their religious identity. The ascent of nones will transform the countrys religious and political landscape says Tina Wray a professor of religious and theological studies at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. About 30 of Americans now call themselves nones. A billboard in 2010 in Oklahoma City paid for by a local atheists group called Coalition of Reason. Sue OgrockiAP The interest of the nones will soon outweigh those of the religious right in just a matter of years Wray says. Nones are going to vote as a bloc and theyre going to be pretty powerful. White evangelicals will eventually be eclipsed by the unaffiliated. Wray says those who are optimistic about the future of the American church underestimate how quickly Christianity can lose its influence even in a place where it once thrived. She cites whats happened in the Republic of Ireland an overwhelmingly Catholic country. The Catholic Church prohibits divorce and was once so powerful in Ireland that the country wouldnt legally grant its citizens the legal right to a divorce until 1995 says Wray author of What the Bible Really Tells Us The Essential Guide to Biblical Literacy. But Wray adds that she recently traveled to Ireland and discovered many of its citizens have left the religion. Churches are being closed and turned into apartment buildings she says. People who went to mass everyday stopped going she says. Theres this cultural Catholic identity but as far as practicing their faith its just disappearing. So within a generation thats all it took. Its just shocking. Why the American churchs future may be different than Europes Most of the religious scholars CNN spoke to said the American church may find salvation in another demographic trend the booming of Christianity in what is called the Global South the regions encompassing Latin America Africa and Asia. The worlds largest megachurch for example is not in the US. Its in South Korea. The Yoido Full Gospel Church has a weekly attendance of about 600000 members. Perry Hamalis spent time as a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea where he personally witnessed the vitality of the Christian church in the Global South. He says the church is not perceived in South Korea as an instrument of oppression but one of liberation. When South Korea was colonized by the Japanese in the early 20th century the church aligned with Koreans to protest. Christianity was looked at not as a religion of empire and of the colonizers but as the religion of the anticolonial movement and of prodemocracy says Hamalis a religion professor at North Central College in Illinois. The US has more immigrants than any other country. People from Latin America and Asia now make up the overwhelming majority of immigrants to the US and many are bringing their religious fervor with them. A service on Christmas Day 2022 at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul South Korea. Chung SungJunGetty Images This migration is known as the Browning of America a phrase describing a demographic shift that is expected to make White people the minority in the US by 2045. Those who predict that the church in America will collapse often overlook how the migration of Global South Christians to America will revitalize the countrys religious landscape scholars say. Christianity could rebound in America if White Christians embrace this one change they say. Tish Harrison Warren a New York Times columnist pointed out recently that Latino evangelicals are now the fastestgrowing group of evangelicals in the US. We cannot assume that America will become more secular so long as the future of America is less white Warren wrote. The influx of Black and brown Christians from places like Latin America and Asia collides with another trend a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement that insists incorrectly that the US was founded as a White Christian nation. It is hostile to nonWhite immigrants. Some churches may discover that Jesus command to welcome the stranger collides with their definition of patriotism Hamalis says. Many congregations dont realize how much of their Christian identity is wrapped up with a kind of Christian nationalist narrative Hamalis says. Theres nothing wrong with loving ones country but from a Christian perspective that ought to always be secondary to the mission of building the body of Christ and witnessing to the Gospel in the world. How Christianity could reestablish its dominance There are other factors hiding in plain sight that point to the continued vitality of Christianity others say. For one declining church membership doesnt automatically translate into declining influence. Consider some recent landmark events. White evangelicals played a critical role in getting former President Trump elected. Conservative Christian groups played a crucial role in the recent passage of state laws limiting LGBTQ rights. And the Supreme Courts decision last year to overturn Roe vs. Wade was a massive victory for many conservative Christians. And atheism remains a taboo in American politics. American voters still prefer candidates  including presidents Barack Obama Donald Trump and Joe Biden  who profess or evoke Christian beliefs. Christianity still holds a lot of capital in this country says Lee M. Jefferson an associate professor of religion at Centre College in Kentucky. There has always been a popular notion that a religious communitys strength or influence is connected to numbers and attendance Jefferson says. Even if there is ample space in cathedrals Christianity will still hold some strong relevance in different landscapes in the US. Even the rise of the nones the growing number of Americans who say they dont care about religion is not as much of a threat to the church as initial reports suggest scholars say. A growing number of Americans may no longer identify as Christian but many still care about spirituality says Hans Gustafson author of Everyday Wisdom Interreligious Studies for a Pluralistic World. Maria Antonetty foreground joins others in a Spanish Easter service at the Primitive Christian Church in New York City on April 12 2009. Tina FinebergAP Just because more Americans are disaffiliating with institutionalized religion  most notably Christian traditions  this does not always mean that people are becoming less religious says Gustafson director of the Jay Phillips Center for Interreligious Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. Many still practice spirituality prayer meditation and sometimes even regularly attend religious houses of worship he says. Among Americans with no religious affiliation some still pray daily and say religion is very important in their lives Gustafson says. Evangelicals at an inflection point not seen in 100 years reverend says 2022 0934  Source CNN He cites a surprising finding from a 2018 Pew Research Center study of religion in Western Europe. The study found that nones in the US are much more likely to pray and believe in God than their European counterparts said Neha Sahgal a vice president of research at Pew. In fact by some of these standard measures of religious commitment American nones are as religious as  or even more religious than  Christians in several European countries including France Germany and the UK Sahgal wrote. Why the Easter message offers a note of hope Despite the optimism of many religious scholars the future of Christianity in America still seems uncertain. Poll numbers about the decline of religiousness in the US cannot be ignored along with something more intangible the frailties of human nature. What if the US enters another xenophobic period and limits migration from nonWhite Christians? What if progressive Christians prove unwilling to align with nonWhite immigrants who tend to be more conservative on issues of sexuality and gender? A woven crown of thorns depicting the one placed on the head of Jesus before his crucifixion at Transfiguration Of Our Lord Ukrainian Catholic Church in Shamokin Pennsylvania. Carolyn KasterAP And what if some Christians still cling to the belief that America is supposed to be a White Christian nation even if that assumption causes them to close their church doors to nonWhite immigrants who could be their salvation? If that happens an Easter morning symbol in American churches wont just be an empty tomb but empty pews. But Hamalis the religion professor who saw Christianity boom in South Korea says Christians who fear that kind of future can take solace in the Easter message. From a Christian perspective theres nothing to fear because even death has been conquered Hamalis says. When we are liberated from that fear we can embrace the person whos different from us who speaks a different language or comes from a different culture. We can put ourselves out there in a way that we cant if were just afraid.

The summer fairytale they call it a summer of golden memories and national euphoria of street parties on scorching evenings a summer that has spawned films and books and songs despite ending in the semifinals for the hosts. All the streets were full everything with German flags public viewing was practically invented remembered Matthias Ginter last week. Ginter was a 12yearold boy in the summer of 2006 and is now a 29yearold defender in the squad that will be expected to recreate the Sommermrchen in 2024.

Twelve fixtures separate Hansi Flicks side from the opening game in Munich in June 2024. All are friendlies which is less than ideal. No host nation has won a World Cup or European Championship on home soil since France in 1998 and perhaps the lack of competitive practice is one reason. The indeterminate 20 win over Peru last Saturday was one example friendlies may show you how bad you are but they wont necessarily show how good you are. Nine minutes into their game against Belgium in Cologne Germany were discovering exactly how bad. They were 20 down Yannick Carrasco and Romelu Lukaku with the goals. Kevin De Bruyne as well as collecting two assists was taking Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka for a joyride in central midfield. Virtually every Belgian attack seemed to generate a shot. Dodi Lukebakio missed a oneonone chance. Lukaku hit the bar with a header. Belgium could quite conceivably have been 40 or 50 up within 20 minutes. The first 35 minutes were the worst Ive seen in my long career grumbled the neverknowinglyunderstated Lothar Matthus on RTL afterwards and for all the comical pratfalling it already felt like an early point of crisis for Flick who had by no means been guaranteed to keep his job after the Qatar shambles. And again it was the habit of conceding unbelievably soft goals that had undone them an incontinent pressing system that somehow left them overcommitted up the pitch but without adequate pressure on the ball. This has to be a oneoff Flick warned. But it was what happened next that arguably made even less sense. Half an hour in Flick had seen enough. Florian Wirtz the teenage prodigy from Bayer Leverkusen was hooked along with the injured Goretzka. Emre Can came on in midfield and began to lock things down. On the stroke of halftime the totemic Bremen striker Niclas Fllkrug  a man who always looks as though hes going to hoist you off the ground for no reason  won and scored a penalty to pull a goal back. Gradually the crowd who had greeted the opening period more with bemusement than genuine anger began to swing behind them. Hansi Flick has a job to get Germany back to their best with only friendly matches between now and the start of Euro 2024. Photograph Markus GilliarGES SportfotoGetty Images This is the fragile connection Germany are also trying to build a challenge as important and intractable as any they face on the pitch. Reconnecting this team to its public  particularly a younger public with strong allegiances to their Bundesliga clubs but only a passing interest in the national side  is one of the Deutscher FussballBunds central missions before next summer. And yet in a country riven by public sector strikes forced in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the end of the Angela Merkel era to reconsider its identity and place in the world the prevailing note is scepticism rather than optimism. Woodstock cannot be repeated the veteran television commentator Bela Rethy said recently. In 2006 Germany was a different country more relaxed more tolerant. Not so dogmatic. Not so demagogic. Not so shoddy in defence either. On 78 minutes De Bruyne made it 31 with another simple counterattack. But even now Germany refused to lie down. The outstanding Serge Gnabry hit the post after an electrifying run that took him past four players. With three minutes remaining he converted from close range after another rapid raid down the left by Kevin Schade of Brentford setting up a rousing finale and about as heroic a 32 defeat as it is possible to conceive. And as they left the stadium everyone seemed satisfied enough. There was broad acknowledgement that this is a transitional team a team with many of its stars Thomas Mller Manuel Neuer Antonio Rdiger Ilkay Gndogan rested or injured. Flick bemoaned the lack of training time afforded him which he said contributed to the scruffiness of his teams attempted pressing. Twelve more experiments. Twelve more games to get this right against a backdrop of apathy a leaky defence an increasingly divided nation and a distinct lack of fullbacks. And yet if the Sommermrchen taught us anything it is that the German public do not demand victory as a nonnegotiable. They will forgive their team even the bitter pill of ultimate failure if it can make them dream. Flicks hardest task over the next 15 months is not to win but to give Germany a team they can believe in.,Bring on the new Sommermrchen read a banner that was unfurled at the RheinEnergie Stadion just before kickoff on Tuesday night.

Theres a totally different atmosphere and support than there was in the dark days of the past he said. I have every reason to expect that England fans will travel to Germany in big numbers and have a very positive impact on the atmosphere of the tournament. As we did last time. The Observer understands that a meeting to discuss Euro 2024 between fan groups the Football Association police foreign office and others will take place in the next few months. An FA spokesperson said that all travel club members would as for all tournaments be policechecked and there were measures in place for fans to report antisocial or discriminatory behaviour. It is also expected that the most hardcore troublemakers on banning orders  about 1300 people  will be told to hand their passports into police before the tournament as they were before last years World Cup in Qatar. England fan Kirsty Payne who has travelled the world supporting the team for more than 20 years said that chants about Two World Wars and One World Cup made her heart sink but were increasingly rare. I think its dying out she said. It costs a lot of money to travel so they are usually proper England supporters who are there for the football.

The obvious explanation is they drank to escape the unbearable awfulness of being in the German Democratic Republic with its omnipresent Stasi clowncar Trabants travel restrictions gerontocratic rulers grim Baltic holidays and laughable elections. Not so argues East Germanborn historian Katja Hoyer. Most East Germans drank not to forget their worries but because they had so little to worry about. She writes for those who wanted a quiet life with the small comforts of home it was a stable place with few concerns or worries. By the late 1980s true the level of surveillance carried out by the Stasi was at an alltime high but often it did little with the information gathered. In this it was arguably less intrusive certainly less effective than todays dataplundering technogiants. Not that Hoyer is an ostalgiefilled apologist. The GDR she describes is one divided between those who resented the permanent state of alert and politicisation of life and others who craved meaning and belonging in contrast to what they perceived to be the empty consumerism of the West. Indeed one way of reading Hoyers revisionist history is as a takedown of western hubris using the example of East Germany to highlight our shortcomings in social mobility and womens rights. Take childcare. In 1989 the GDR had one of the highest rates of female employment in the world mostly because state nurseries open from 6am to 6pm admitted children from birth. But after the Berlin Wall fell such expensively egalitarian services were dismantled and East German mothers found it difficult to square parenting with a career. As Hoyer puts it they were baffled when they had to justify why they even wanted both. As for social mobility the GDR gave ordinary citizens chances that homologues raised in say Britains sclerotic public school plutocracy can hardly aspire to. Tens of thousands of young people from workingclass backgrounds had been encouraged to study promoted to leadership positions and given scholarships Hoyer writes. In 1953 when there was an uprising against the fouryearold GDR many saw it as a threat to their new status. One consequence was the rise in voluntary security organisations such as the Freiwilliger Helfer der Volkspolizei Voluntary Auxiliary of the Peoples Police. An estimated 5000 volunteers even helped defend the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 believing no doubt that their homeland with all its opportunities needed protecting and prepared to spend their free time doing so. When Germany was divided into British French American and Russian sectors after the fall of the Third Reich few expected the last one would become an independent nation still less a walledin Stasiland. What is this GDR? asked Stalins security henchman Lavrentiy Beria in 1952. Its not even a proper state. It only exists because of Soviet troops. True Hoyer argues Moscow saw East Germany as geopolitical pawn to be sacrificed if necessary in order to win the burgeoning cold war. Indeed Stalin sought a reunified and neutral Germany as buffer between the socialist east and capitalist west. A year later though Stalin was dead and Beria was executed with a bullet to the head while East Germany would survive for another 37 years. On October 7 1989 a fouryearold Hoyer and her father celebrated the GDRs 40th anniversary with a trip to the viewing platform of Berlins Fernsehturm the socialistbuilt TV tower. Below police cars converged on Alexanderplatz in an attempt to quell the unstoppable protests that led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall a month later. Like most East Germans her dad had no inclination to join the demonstrators the Hoyers were comfortable with their secondhand Trabant and twobed flat in a 1960s prefab block. Today their daughter lives in the UK but not without a memory of what died that day. What makes her meticulous book essential reading is not so much its sense of what East Germans lost as what we never had. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The king had been scheduled to arrive in France on Sunday on his first state visit as monarch. He was due to visit Paris and Bordeaux before heading to Germany on Wednesday. Asked if the cancellation was humiliating for France the French president replied What would have been detestable for the British people as well as for ourselves would have been to maintain it with possible incidents in the process. In a statement earlier in the day the lyse Palace said the decision to postpone the visit had been taken by the French and British governments following a telephone conversation between Macron and Charles on Friday morning after mass protests against the French government the previous day. In a statement Buckingham Palace said The king and the queen consorts state visit to France has been postponed. Their majesties greatly look forward to the opportunity to visit France as soon as dates can be found. People angry at the French president were continuing protests on Friday after mass demonstrations on Thursday and had planned a further day of action next Tuesday during the royal visit. The lyse statement said it hoped to welcome the king in conditions that correspond our friendly relations and that the visit would be rescheduled as soon as possible. From the moment last night when the unions announced a new day of mobilisation on Tuesday and the kings visit was scheduled for Monday to Wednesday I think it would not be serious and would lack a certain common sense to propose to his majesty the king and queen consort to come on a state visit in the midst of demonstrations Macron said. As we have much friendship respect and esteem for his majesty the king and queen consort and the British people I took the initiative and called him to tell him the situation and the announcement of a new day of action and good sense and friendship led us to propose a postponement. He added When calm returns perhaps at the beginning depending on our diaries we can schedule a new state visit and we can welcome the new king and queen consort in conditions that will allow them to enjoy Paris as well as Bordeaux. More than 450 protesters were arrested on Thursday as about 300 demonstrations drew more than a million people nationwide to protest against unpopular pension changes that would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Unions said more than 3 million people took to the streets to demonstrate against a fiercely contested law that was pushed through parliament without a vote last week. 0118 Bordeaux city hall set on fire amid protests over France pension changes  video The president and his wife Brigitte had been due to host a banquet for Charles and Camilla the Queen Consort at the former royal palace at Versailles which critics viewed as having echoes of Marie Antoinette feasting while Paris revolted. Fabien Villedieu of the SudRail union had called on protesters to demonstrate at Versailles. We have two kings today one in England and one in France. Lets all go to Versailles and give them a proper welcome Villedieu told BFM TV. Olivier Besancenot of the New Anticapitalist party had said Well welcome Charles III with a good old general strike. On Thursday JeanLuc Mlenchon of the radical left La France Insoumise LFI told French television that the king was welcome in France but it is not the right time. After learning that the visit had been postponed Mlenchon tweeted The meeting of kings at Versailles broken up by popular demand. Raquel Garrido an LFI MP added Two kings were due to meet at Versailles. One down. One to go. After their arrival at Orly airport for the threeday visit on Sunday and a welcome by the French prime minister lisabeth Borne the programme included a ceremony under the Arc de Triomphe and a visit to the Muse dOrsay. Charles was due to give a speech at the Snat the upper house of the French parliament. The royal couple was then due to travel by train to Bordeaux on Tuesday to witness the devastation caused by last summers wildfires before marking the opening of the British consulate in the city and visiting an organic vineyard. Shortly before the announcement that the visit was to be postponed the interior minister Grald Darmanin was still insisting the visit would go ahead despite threats of disruption. We are obviously ready to welcome him the king in excellent conditions he said. However there were threats to disrupt the visit. French strikers had reportedly refused to literally roll out the red carpet while the powerful CGT union had said in a statement We will not be doing the furnishings the red carpets or other flags and decorations. Officials at Mobilier National the government agency responsible for the states furniture and fittings insisted enough people would be found to do so. About 4000 police and gendarmes were expected to be mobilised for the state visit which would have put additional pressure on law and order forces already stretched from policing weeks of protests.

Katja Hoyer is just old enough to remember its demise. In October 1989 when she was four years old her father took her on a trip to the top of Berlins Fernsehturm or Television Tower. Then and now the tallest building in Germany this masterpiece of socialist architecture was built between 1965 and 1969 as a demonstration of East Germanys technological prowess. But on that day in October when Hoyer looked down she saw squads of the Peoples Police arresting protesters on the massive cement square below. Neither policemen nor the protesters could have known that in a mere month the Berlin Wall would fall. Nor would they have imagined that in a years time the German Democratic Republic or GDR would cease to exist. Thirty years after its passing Hoyer now a journalist and historian has returned to the land of her birth with this rich counterintuitive history of a country all too often dismissed as a freak or accident of the cold war. Hoyers East Germany is not though the walledin Russiancontrolled Stasiland whose citizens suffered from constant surveillance and intimidation at the hands of the Ministry for State Security. Rather in her telling it was a place where people shaped their own destinies and lived lives in full colour  a far cry from the grey monotonous blur conjured by the western imagination. Unemployment barely existed. Housing was universally available and relatively cheap Hoyers East Germany was also a state whose leaders although propped up by the Red Army and dependent on the Soviet Union for critical raw materials in particular oil sought to navigate an independent path at home and on the international stage. Her account is largely a political history although one interspersed with interviews with ordinary East Germans teachers accountants factory workers and more tellingly the police officers and border guards who made the state work. Originally under Soviet army occupation following the end of the second world war East Germany became an independent country on 7 October 1949. But the story Hoyer tells in Beyond the Wall starts much earlier with the German Communist partys struggle to survive between Hitler and Stalin. In the runup to the second world war party members faced arrest and torture in Nazi Germany. This drove much of its leadership into exile in the Soviet Union where most eventually perished either in the gulags or by firing squad as victims of Stalins purges. The remnant of the party that survived to take over East Germany after the war was battlehardened and utterly loyal to its Soviet masters. Brought to Germany by the invading Red Army the partys leaders  most notably Walter Ulbricht and Wilhelm Pieck  began establishing a communistled dictatorship in the Soviet occupied zone. In a few years they succeeded in rapidly transforming the social economic and political organisation of the east by redistributing land nationalising industry and quashing any organised political opposition. In the process they triggered a mass exodus across the still open border to the west. Socialism triumphs a 1958 East German propaganda poster. Illustration ShawshotsAlamy Following Stalins death in 1953 the Communist party restyled as the more inclusivesounding Socialist Unity party or SED ruled East Germany with a mixture of repression and accommodation. On one hand the role of state security  the dreaded Stasi  expanded enormously. On the other the party leadership did what it could to ensure that all East Germans were at least gainfully employed and had their basic needs met. But it was not enough as long as an escape route remained open in the divided city of Berlin East Germany continued to haemorrhage skilled workers to the west. By 1961 almost 300000 people were leaving the GDR every year. That year the GDRs party head and unquestioned leader Ulbricht decided to put a stop to this flight once and for all by building the Berlin Wall  something he achieved at least in its initial woodandbarbed wire phase practically overnight and against the objections of his Soviet minders. Trapped behind barbed wire but increasingly prosperous East Germany began to resemble the gilded cage of the eastern bloc at least in the eyes of its socialist neighbours. However as Hoyer points out at least the gilding was real East Germany really did enjoy the highest standard of living of any socialist state. Unemployment barely existed. Housing was universally available and relatively cheap. Abundant accessible childcare allowed women to enter the workforce at a higher rate than in any other country in the world. As Erika Krger one of the workers Hoyer interviewed recalled life in the 1970s and 80s was quite happy We worked received our regular wages as well as bonuses for hard work. We got by and had nothing to worry about. It was only when Krger visited her sisterinlaw in West Germany that she realised the gap in living standards between east and west. But if East Germany lagged behind in the production of consumer goods and especially luxuries one of the many surprises of Beyond the Wall is the revelation of the extreme lengths the East German leadership was willing to go to keep its populace supplied with the imported goods and foodstuffs it considered essential to their emotional wellbeing. People were provided with stability relative prosperity and social mobility. It was a workers state that catered to workers interests. All of which prompts the question  why did it also build the largest per capita security system the world has ever known? Hoyer places most of the blame on paranoia especially on the part of the Stasis shadowy boss Erich Mielke. But one man does not a system make. It is here where one occasionally wishes that Hoyer broadened her vision from East Germany to the eastern bloc as a whole. A comparative viewpoint might have made clearer the peculiarity of East Germanys achievement and its tragedy. Both were rooted in the same geographic fact. As part of a larger prewar Germany East Germany was faced with the constant counterexample of the neighbouring Federal Republic. Its proximity just over the Wall encouraged its leadership to make their version of socialism as effective as humanly possible. It also pushed them to create one of the most extensive systems of control the world has ever seen.

The training ground instructions are in English. The WhatsApp group is in English. Mercifully so is the rest of this interview. Still for a Barrow girl there are times when Munich feels a long way from home. Beans on toast is one example you can buy baked beans in Germany but somehow they dont taste the same to her. The 24yearold misses her family and friends even though they do their best to visit. Bayern may be giants of the mens game but in womens football they have won comparatively little. In leaving Manchester City then Stanway was stepping well out of her comfort zone into the challenge of a new country the test of a new league the burden that comes with being a marquee foreign signing the responsibility of dictating big games. Games such as the Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal on Tuesday. Ominously for Arsenal Stanways adaptation on the pitch has been a good deal smoother than her adaptation off it. Already this season she has scored seven goals from central midfield forging a formidable partnership with Sarah Zadrazil playing a starring role in a 31 deconstruction of Barcelona. Ive settled quicker than Ive expected she says. Ive improved a lot quicker than I expected as well. If there was a flashbulb moment in all this then it came in late October. After a slow start in the Bundesliga and a defeat by title rivals Wolfsburg Bayern travelled to Benfica in the Champions League. Stanway still hadnt scored a goal for her new club. On a warm night in Lisbon they went 20 down after an hour. Stanway remembers Were all looking at each other thinking here we go again. Maxi Rall pulled a goal back. But with seven minutes remaining Bayern were still behind. At which point Stanway got the ball in the Benfica half and started running into space. Sound familiar? This is perhaps the signature Stanway move the point at which she sees the gap breaks the chains and just goes. Three months earlier against Spain at Euro 2022 she saw a similar gap and won the game in extra time. Here 20 yards out she let fly with her left foot and buried a low shot into the corner. Then in the eighth minute of injury time she scored an almost identical goal with her right foot. Neither Bayern nor Stanway have looked back since. Georgia Stanway surges forward during Bayern Munichs Champions League group game against Benfica in October. Photograph Gualter FatiaGetty Images What goes through her mind in these moments? Is it a hero complex a kind of extreme clarity? I think its just intuition she says. You suddenly make a decision and back yourself. Im a person that doesnt have any regrets on the field. If I have a shot I have a shot. Im not too bothered. Jill Scott instilled that in me at City. Everything you do you do with full intent. I want to prove myself. I want to showcase every single aspect of me as a person and a player. And in those moments I can be special. We talk a little more about what she and Bayern are trying to build together not so much a praxis as a mentality. Wolfsburg are currently the dominant team in Germany with five of the last six titles. They have reached five Champions League finals to Bayerns none. So what comes first the winning mentality or the winning? How do Bayern take that final step? Theres a very fine line between us and Wolfsburg Stanway argues. They seem to edge it. Not really sure why. If youre constantly getting beat by the same team theres always that block. But its one of them where if we can beat Wolfsburg the tables will turn. The mentality can flip. At times we need to be nastier. Thats something I say to the girls a lot. Sometimes were a little bit too nice to each other a bit too nice with the opposition. This may be an opportune moment to point out that Stanway already has seven yellow cards this season. For now it is Arsenal in their crosshairs and a reunion with old friends Leah Williamson Lotte WubbenMoy and the injured Beth Mead with whom she shared the ride of a lifetime with England last summer. Since the draw was made last month there have been friendly greetings shared dinner plans made. Hopefully they can stay after the game and I can show them a little bit of the city Stanway says. What is Williamson like to play against? Nasty Stanway replies immediately. You dont want to be on her bad side. But I love her to bits and shes one of my closest friends. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter Informative passionate entertaining.

Photograph Alessandra TarantinoAP And so we come to the European Championship the white elephant in the room the thing that everyone remembers but is also desperate not to dwell on. There have been books documentaries retrospectives. The whole thing has been memorialised so efficiently that the actual memories are hard to discern. Does she ever get tired of being asked about it? No she says. You dont get tired of it. But its difficult. You dont really have time to reflect because youre on to the next thing. If there was anything I would tell myself in that moment its to try and be more present. Make the most of those days. Over the years Ive talked to athletes who achieved great things and then felt almost nothing afterwards who reached the pinnacle and didnt know how to feel about it. Did this happen to her? Stanway thinks for a moment. Because the biggest high of your life you almost experience a comedown she says. You experience different things at different times. I was fortunate not to experience it straight away because I was moving to Bayern it was something new it was exciting. So I probably experienced mine a little bit later maybe over the Christmas period. Youve just got to dig a little bit deeper to find that motivation. But no longer. There is a World Cup coming this summer reputations to make and defend a chance to make new history with a new team. The games against Arsenal will show us just how far Bayern have come the duels with Kim Little and Lia Wlti will give Stanway an idea of her own progress. These are the sorts of challenges Stanway signed up for the tests she has always craved. Its a difficult one she says finally. But its also the most exciting.,Guten Tag. Wie gehts? Sehr gut und dir?

Hodgson is of course Southgates de facto predecessor in the job setting aside the onegame Sam Allardyce interlude which feels more than ever like the managerial equivalent of a halfremembered lost weekend on a Norwegian booze ferry. As England prepare for the doubleheader against Italy in Naples and Ukraine at Wembley first steps on the gentle downhill slope towards Germany 2024 it is worth remembering just how lost they were back then. Which was to be clear very lost indeed. Hodgsons own time did at least provide some variation veering between the slowburn humiliation of Kyiv 2012 the more vivid and sustained humiliation of Brazil 2014 through to the generational humiliation of Nice two years later Hodgson emerging for his final bow looking like a casino floor rou still dressed in last nights tuxedo the weight of a halfimagined sporting empire on his sagging shoulders. It is worth remembering all this if only because the journey from there to here has been a little undervalued. If Southgate makes it to Germany he will become the first proper England manager to take the team to four proper tournaments. Walter Winterbottom lasted four World Cups but he was more a kind of house master figure cooking dinner and doing the washing up taking the players to the opera. SvenGran Eriksson got three tournaments Bobby Robson three and Alf Ramsey three in less congested times the internet will tell you Ramsey also reached the quarterfinals of Euro 72 but in fact this was a losing twolegged playoff to get to the tournament proper. In the shadow of this Southgate so awkward in his early public appearances he was described by one wag as resembling an anteater that is only now realising its not supposed to be able to talk has become the curator of England footballs most sustained period of success in the last half century. It is worth remembering this too as the endgame starts to take shape. In many ways the best England Southgate is still early England Southgate that beaky figure in the rented wedding suit who seemed for one sunlit summer to be proving that this isnt an impossible job after all. Gareth Southgates popularity peaked during Englands World Cup campaign in 2018. Photograph Clive RoseGetty Images Over time as simple competence has been met with a chorus of howling public dismay Southgate has established the opposite. This thing really is doomed to the extent we have now reached a peak moment in the Gareth Paradox the logic of which goes a bit like this. Southgates early success was based on shedding the burden of English exceptionalism. In doing so he also dramatically reinvigorated English exceptionalism. As such and thanks to his own early gains Southgate is now considered by some a national disgrace the poison not the cure for the crime of failing to win three straight tournaments playing allout attacking Albionball. Winning just a bit is not enough. Only all of the winning will do. There is no escape route from here. If England go on to win Euro 2024 playing classic Southgatestyle roundhead football he will be condemned for not winning it right. If England win playing thrilling fastforward football there will be uproar and toldyousos at the failure to do this previously. Not winning Euro 2024 the most likely outcome for every manager present will see Southgate waved off by many as an outright failure whereas in reality he is the precise opposite a qualified and commendable success. In part this is related to tribal politics. Southgate has supported his players in protesting against racism has expressed misgivings about the state of England. Hes still Nord a little gawky and wellspoken unblokey and academic in his approach. For these crimes some will never forgive him. Quick Guide Italy v England predicted lineups Show Italy 433 Donnarumma Di Lorenzo Toli Acerbi Spinazzola Barella Jorginho Verratti Berardi Retegui Pellegrini England 433 Pickford Walker Stones Maguire Shaw Phillips Rice Bellingham Saka Kane Foden Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Mainly the hostility is based in a loss of scale the refusal to accept that England can be just quite good that England winning is not the natural order of things anything else a baffling aberration. Or indeed that if Southgate were simply to maximise the attacking power to let slip the dogs of Gareth stop tying us in defensive red tape then the world would kneel before Albion as it longs to deep down. Southgate succeeded by knowing the limits of his team. This was never going to be enough. We demand our sunlit uplands of the halfimagined past. There will be more talk of how exactly England are going to play now if the style of this team can become a little more geared towards attack. And it is a point worth making firstly because England did exactly this at the World Cup and second because this group of players looks equipped to take it a little further. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

First because Southgate did all the things he is often accused of ducking. The team for a World Cup quarterfinal was a 433 with KaneSakaFodenBellingham and four attacking subs to follow. England had 16 shots to Frances eight and 57 possession. They got stronger as the game wore on and dominated midfield in the second half a reversal of the pattern of recent tournaments. Only the most committed antiSouthgate truther could find a timidity in the approach here. England lost because France have mature highgrade players in all positions and executed the fine details better such as for example not gumbooting a late penalty over the bar. But there is room to take this further now. Southgate should also have learned from the experience. And the squad has improved even in the last four months. Reece James is a major addition. Jack Grealish is playing well for Manchester City. Bukayo Saka gets better with every game. Jude Bellingham is on a constant upward curve. Ivan Toney looks like actual centreforward backup. Marcus Rashford will hopefully bring new unstoppable Marcus Rashford when he returns. The same weaknesses remain. Jordan Pickford is a good but not Agrade goalkeeper and the same can be said of the centrebacks. England lack a really good controlling player in midfield. But there is encouragement in Southgates best solution to this which does not involve playing five defenders. The great gift from the World Cup is the evidence that Bellinghams allround palette of skills means Southgate can play a threeman midfield while protecting defensive weaknesses and retaining attacking strengths. The presence of Kalvin Phillips in this squad has drawn enmity and the dread accusation of loyalty which is always a terrible thing. But Phillips is in because that role is vital to releasing these strengths and Southgate doesnt have many midfielders who can run and pass and cover. It seems clear Southgate would ideally have Phillips in that three. This isnt loyalty. Its an investment in a player who has the required skills to make that shape work and free up rest of the team. And so on to Germany which feels like a Southgate kind of tournament. His professional life still revolves around the moment at its centre the primly scuffed Euro 96 penalty Andreas Mllers wildly infuriating victory prance that profound sense of an endless England operetta of hope and misfortune. By the end of Germany 2024 should England get there only Ramsey and Winterbottom will have managed more games. Southgate himself will have spent 20 years of his life as an England player and coach defining the role more clearly than any other modern incarnation. History suggests there are no happy endings in this job. Not to mention very few happy beginnings or happy middle periods. But Qatar 2022 was paradoxical too arguably Southgates best tournament in terms of fluency and development despite the less showy end result. England have made a habit of losing a few of these limbweary midweek filler games. But there is still a chance here to end on a major chord.,There is a nice note of circularity about the reemergence of Roy Hodgson English footballs own courtly blazered grail knight in the same week that Gareth Southgate sets off on what will surely be his own final story cycle as England manager.

More than 100 years later a feature film about the violence perpetrated by Germany in what is now Namibia explores that brutal colonial past for the first time. Its director hopes Measures of Men will bring the calamitous episode to the attention of ordinary Germans. Germany has denied its colonial past for 120 years Lars Kraume said in advance of the films domestic release on Thursday. Most people are unaware Germany even had a colonial past let alone anything about the brutality of it  it is not even taught in schools. Measures of Men filmed mainly on location in Namibia using local crew and expertise tells the story of Alexander Hoffmann  played by Leonard Scheicher  a young idealistic but wideeyed ethnologist who questions the evolutionist racial theories of the time according to which sizes and shapes of skulls determined intelligence. His attempts to rebut the pseudoscientific legitimisation of the superiority of white people over people from the colony of southwest Africa leads him to take first an intellectual and then a romantic interest in Kezia Kambazemi the interpreter of a delegation of Nama and Herero people who are shipped to Berlin to participate in the Kaisers Vlkerschau or human zoo exposition. Despite studying history for his final exams in Germany Kraume became aware of Germanys colonial past only when he visited Namibia in the early 1990s immediately after its independence from South Africa. That experience sowed the seeds for his film he said. His aim was always to make an accurate historical retelling of the events but one which is also relevant and important to the present. Kraume was particularly shocked by the existence of thousands of skulls of people murdered by Germans which were gathered and shipped to Germany in large quantities and still exist in museums across the country. I cannot comprehend the fact that we have these skulls like artefacts stored in ethnological museums he said. I cannot understand why they are still being kept and have not been given back. You ask yourself Why were the skulls collected in the first place and why have we not seen fit to give them back? Kraume said it was shameful that Germany had yet to give an official apology for the genocide or for the theft of human remains and cultural artefacts. The films relevance to the present day Kraume said is also in its depiction of how those in power choose to ignore scientific facts and truth for political gain and in order to maintain the status quo. The same bogus theories of race espoused at the time later became subsumed into the Nazi regimes policies which were used to justify the Holocaust. Captured prisoners during the 190408 war between Germany and the Herero and Nama tribes in Namibia. Photograph National Archieves of NamibiaAFPGetty Images In Germany debate about the countrys colonial project has long been overshadowed by the crimes of the National Socialist era. While most German cities commemorate the victims of the Nazi period there are no significant monuments to the victims of German colonialism. Girley Charlene Jazama who plays the part of Kambazemi is one of hundreds of Namibians involved in the project. A Herero herself she said participating in the film was more than just taking on a film role but was connected directly to her own family history. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

She worked as a tea lady for one of the German commandants Jazama said in an interview in Berlin. She was raped by an officer in the camp. My greatgrandmother was subsequently born in one of these concentration camps in 1909. Jazama appealed to the German authorities to facilitate the return of the skulls to Namibia as soon as possible. They quite simply do not belong to the Germans. I hope that over the course of time they will return to their rightful owners the Namibians so that they can be given a dignified burial. They are part of the trauma that has been passed from generation to generation she said adding that many Namibians are yet to be made aware of the facts of the colonisation. Kraume said one of the moral dilemmas he had experienced shooting the film was how to persuade Namibian actors to reconstruct scenes of violence based on reallife events. How do you tackle a scene in which soldiers hang two Herero men? How dramatic and how factual do you dare to make it? The film charts the moral degeneration of Hoffmann the ethnologist. Kraume insisted that because of Germanys perpetrator role not only in this period but later in the Nazi era there could be nothing redeeming about the character. Make a film of real heroes where you find them but you simply cannot invent a German hero. Hoffmanns cowardice Kraume said is a reflection of Europeans attitude towards Africa. Like Hoffmann they have run away  thats what we keep doing with Africa failing to admit to the terror we have brought to Africa turning away from their problems as if theyre nothing to do with us. Germany he points out while admitting to the genocide committed by its army and having returned the remains of Herero and Nama men and women in 2018 has yet to sign a reparation agreement with Namibia. In recent weeks the film has been viewed by audiences across Namibia in a solarpowered mobile cinema. The whole purpose of this film is that it will trigger debate that people will exchange opinions wherever it is shown Kraume said.,It was one of the darkest eras in German history and the first genocide of the 20th century the mass killing of tens of thousands of people in German South West Africa after a rebellion against colonial rule by the Herero and Nama tribes.

Ferencz a Harvardeducated lawyer secured convictions of numerous German officers who led roving death squads during the war. Circumstances of his death were not immediately disclosed. The New York Times reported that Ferencz died at an assisted living facility in Boynton Beach Florida. He was just 27 years old when he served as a prosecutor in 1947 at Nuremberg where Nazi defendants including Hermann Gring faced a series of trials for crimes against humanity including the genocide known as the Holocaust in which six million Jewish people and millions of others were systematically killed. Ferencz then advocated for decades for the creation of an international criminal court a goal realised with the establishment of an international tribunal that sits in The Hague the Netherlands. Ferencz also was a significant donor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum established in Washington. Today the world lost a leader in the quest for justice for victims of genocide and related crimes the US Holocaust Museum said in a post on Twitter. Today the world lost a leader in the quest for justice for victims of genocide and related crimes. We mourn the death of Ben Ferenczthe last Nuremberg war crimes prosecutor. At age 27 with no prior trial experience he secured guilty verdicts against 22 Nazis.  US Holocaust Museum HolocaustMuseum April 8 2023 At Nuremberg Ferencz became chief prosecutor for the US in the trial of 22 officers who led mobile paramilitary killing squads known as Einsatzgruppen that were part of the notorious Nazi SS. The squads carried out mass killings targeting Jewish people Gypsies and others  primarily civilians  during the war in Germanoccupied Europe and were responsible for more than a million deaths. It is with sorrow and with hope that we here disclose the deliberate slaughter of more than a million innocent and defenseless men women and children Ferencz said in his opening statement at the trial. This was the tragic fulfilment of a program of intolerance and arrogance. Vengeance is not our goal nor do we seek merely a just retribution. We ask this court to affirm by international penal action mans right to live in peace and dignity regardless of his race or creed. The case we present is a plea of humanity to law Ferencz added. Ferencz told the court that the accused officers methodically carried out longrange plans to exterminate ethnic national political and religious groups condemned in the Nazi mind. Genocide  the extermination of whole categories of human beings  was a foremost instrument of the Nazi doctrine Ferencz said. The defendants all were convicted and 13 were given death sentences. It was Ferenczs first career case. Born on 11 March 1920 in Transylvania Romania Ferencz was 10 months old when his family moved to the United States where he grew up poor in New York Citys Hells Kitchen. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1943 he joined the U.S. military and fought in Europe before joining the US armys newly formed war crimes section. He seized documents and record evidence at Nazi death camps such as Buchenwald after their liberation by allied forces surveying scenes of human misery including piles of emaciated corpses and the crematoriums where untold numbers of bodies were incinerated. After the war ended in 1945 Ferencz was recruited to join in the US prosecution at the war crimes trials in Nuremberg a city where the Nazi leadership had held elaborate propaganda rallies before the war serving under US General Telford Taylor. The trials were controversial at the time but ended up being hailed as a milestone on the path toward establishing international law and holding war criminals accountable in evenhanded trials. What was most significant about it was it gave us and it gave me an insight into the mentality of mass murderers Ferencz said in a 2018 interview with the American Bar Association. They had murdered over a million people including hundreds of thousands of children in cold blood and I wanted to understand how it is that educated people  many of them had PhDs or they were generals in the German Army  could not only tolerate but lead and commit such horrible crimes. After the Nuremberg trials Ferencz worked to secure compensation for Holocaust victims and survivors. Ferencz later advocated for the creation of an international criminal court. In 1998 120 countries adopted a statute in Rome to establish the international criminal court which came into force in 2002.,Benjamin Ferencz the last surviving prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials in Germany that brought Nazi war criminals to justice after the second world war and a longtime apostle of international criminal law died on Friday at age 103 US media reported citing his son.

Weeks after the Match of the Day presenter was suspended for criticising government immigration policy the former England footballer has said he stands by his remarks in an interview with Mens Health UK magazine. The row began when the former England footballer responded to a video message by the home secretary Suella Braverman about stopping people crossing the Channel in small boats. He wrote Good heavens this is beyond awful. He later tweeted This is just an immeasurably cruel policy. Referring to the tweet in which he also likened the home secretarys language to that of 1930s Germany Lineker said I think that is factually accurate. The BBCs highestpaid presenter said he wasnt prepared to back down on language he felt was fair and true. In the video announcing an illegal migration bill that has since come under fire from the UN Refugee Agency Braverman said the new legislation would help to detain and remove asylum seekers arriving in small boats. Lineker told the magazine I talked about the use of words like invasion and swarms and criminals and rapists which I think we should be very careful about because it has reallife consequences. He added that he has worked with refugee charities for years. I wasnt abusive I wasnt saying she Braverman was a Nazi he said. After the impartiality row the BBC announced an independent review of its social media guidelines a decision later echoed by the regulator Ofcom which said the corporations editorial guidelines needed updating for the modern world. The BBCs chair Richard Sharp also came under increasing pressure to quit after the corporation apologised for its actions. Lineker who receives 1.35m annually returned to presenting sport on the BBC after widespread disruption to sports programming when presenters Ian Wright Alan Shearer and Alex Scott among others pulled out of their respective shows in solidarity. The BBC has attempted to frame the row over Lineker as a question of preserving impartiality. However the corporation did not take any action when Lineker questioned Qatars human rights record during the recent mens football World Cup. Linekers agent Jon Holmes who has worked with the former footballer since 1980 previously said his client believed he had a special agreement with the BBCs director general to tweet publicly on matters surrounding refugees and immigration. Lineker told Mens Health UK that when new social media guidelines were introduced by the director general Tim Davie in 2020 he agreed he would not stop occasionally tweeting about the climate crisis and refugees. He said a key resolution with senior management at the BBC had come as other presenters expressed solidarity after he was taken off the air for his remarks. I love the BBC and I was very glad to be back on air and talking about football again Lineker said.

It was the first and only appearance on home soil this season for a squad that qualified for the World Cup by winning the European Under19s championships last summer. We were desperate to play in England as European champions says Foster who oversaw the triumph in Slovakia and has stayed in charge of the groups development. It is our only opportunity to do so and I thought the crowd of 2205 was brilliant. We chose Germany for two reasons one it is a special fixture and secondly because of the Elite League they are in. Their players are a year older than ours so we knew it would be a sterner test. World Cup preparations would normally be stepping up at this stage not merely starting but the unprecedented timing of the senior tournament had an impact on the football calendar at numerous levels.

We havent seen them since September and because of injury we havent seen a few others since the summer.

The tournament the first Fifa event to be held in Indonesia which was due to host in 2021 before the Covid pandemic forced a cancellation will be played between 20 May and 11 June. England plan to depart about 11 May because as the head coach explains You are crossing eight time zones so ideally you should have eight days in the country to acclimatise before you play. But the Premier League season does not finish until 28 May and the Championship while staging its final round on 8 May has the playoffs at the end of that month. Serie A where Englands matchwinner against Germany is making his way ends on 4 June. Italy have also qualified for Indonesia and their national association faces similarly delicate negotiations with their clubs. Because the World Cup is being played in the season not at the end of the season we wont have any prep games because we will have to leave it as late as we possibly can to get the players out of the clubs says Foster. It is the Fifa international World Cup being played outside the Fifa international window which doesnt particularly help anybody. But listen Germany at home USA who are North American champions and then France who are a wonderful outfit are three really interesting and tough games for us. Thats what we need. Wednesday brought encouragement for Englands World Cup prospects however.

Trigger Cut a threepiece from Stuttgart were due to play seven venues in the UK this week but say they were turned away by the UK Border Force at Calais on Thursday 6 April. Tim Burgess the frontman of The Charlatans said the German bands nightmare experience showed the damage Brexit was doing to touring musicians What happened to Trigger Cut is scary as bands from the EU are facing confusing and complex rules that mean UK tour dates might just not be worth their while. Ian Smith a longtime music agent who cofounded Carry On Touring and ukeartswork.info which campaigns to help artists work in the EU and UK said each month he heard of artists from the EU being refused entry because of postBrexit requirements. They are so bloody opaque and confusing he said. Trigger Cut say their passports were confiscated and they were kept in a room for verification at Calais before a Border Force officer asked them for a certificate of sponsorship COS from each venue they were due to play. Ralph Schaarschmidt Trigger Cuts guitarist wrote on Facebook Months of planning 1750km of driving to Calais and back to Stuttgart van hire costs paid for expensive customs declarations ferry ticket  all for nothing. We are sitting in a deep dark hole emotionally right now this is a nightmare  I think Ive never felt so degraded sad and bad as I do today. Smith who has been in touch with the band said they did not have the COS certificates. Instead they planned to enter the UK under the permitted paid engagement PPE exemption which is free. This allows musicians to spend up to one month touring the UK if they are invited and paid by a UKbased organisation or client. Artists must be able to show a formal invitation to attend a prearranged event and prove they can support themselves during the trip and can pay for their return journey. A COS is an alternative route into the UK regarded as a safer bet but with more onerous paperwork said Smith. It involves a promoter sponsoring the band and checking their eligibility and vouching for them during their stay in the UK from a few days to up to 90 days. Smith said many artists were getting stuck at the border because the government guidance was unclear and printed only in English rather than any EU languages. The other problem he said was that individual border officers can use their discretion to refuse anyone they like at the border and there is no right of appeal. Schaarschmidt said he would not try to tour the UK again Despite all the love for music these bureaucratic costintensive humiliating conditions are not at all tolerable. Burgess said the damage of Brexit to musicians was unfolding slowly and there are already major difficulties for touring bands with spiralling costs and dwindling potential income affected by streaming. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

He called on the government to make it easier for bands to play live for the audiences who wanted to see them both UK artists in the EU and vice versa. The government rattle on enough that music is one of the UKs strongest exports but they are hollowing out the chances for new artists in the future he said. Smith said the government should educate UK promoters and venues in the entry requirements for overseas artists to stop other artists suffering the same fate as Trigger Cut. A government spokesman declined to answer questions about why Trigger Cut were refused entry to the UK. They said Musicians and performers are a valued and important part of UK culture with the country attracting world class entertainers and musicians from around the globe.

Smith Rowe and Harvey Elliott failed to make an impact in the opening period and Cameron Archer was bullied by Chelseas Benot Badiashile and Mohamed Simakan but after the restart England were positive and got their reward five minutes into the second half. Oliver Skipp seized on Badiashiles loose pass and found Morgan GibbsWhite who crossed for the unmarked Smith Rowe to head in from six yards.

The European Championship qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley 27 March 2015. The centreforwards script writers had been busy that season the one in which he broke through so suddenly at Tottenham and they were never going to disappoint. On as a 71stminute substitute for Wayne Rooney Kane took only 79 seconds to score a farpost header from Raheem Sterlings cross. The TV cameras cut to Rooney on the bench smiling broadly and applauding. Afterwards he would sign Kanes shirt along with the rest of the team. Well done mate 1st of many he wrote. Rooney knew that there would be many many more. Harry Kane scores his first England goal a header against Lithuania in March 2015. Photograph Christopher LeeThe FAGetty Images Spool forward to Kanes fourth cap the qualifier against Switzerland in September of that year when he scored his third England goal. He was on the pitch when Rooney made it 20 from the penalty spot to reach 50 for the nation and break Sir Bobby Charltons record. In fact Kane was the first player over to celebrate with Rooney whispering something in his ear before embracing him. What did he say? Congratulations surely. Or perhaps Im coming for you. It is fun to imagine. Kanes chase to overhaul Rooneys eventual tally of 53 has been marked by everything that defines him dedication determination composure under pressure selfbelief. There have been memorable high points  along with the lows  and the overall sense of a hunter reeling in its prey inexorably inevitably. For some time it has come to be a question of where and when. Now we have the answer Kane getting there with a penalty of almost implausibly rich narrative strands in Thursday nights Euro 2024 qualifying win over Italy in Naples. The 29yearold faces a struggle to process the magnitude of what he has achieved  Harry Kane Englands alltime leading scorer shudder  but the first thing to say is that it truly is the fulfilment of a dream. With all the love and respect for Spurs Kane has always considered England as his No 1 priority and he has never hidden that. He loves to look back on the photos of himself and his elder brother Charlie in their England shirts as kids or remember how they would go with their parents Pat and Kim to the Sirloin pub in Chingford east London to watch the major tournament ties. Kane saw almost all of Englands games at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup in the Sirloins huge beer garden and he would imagine when he was older that he could become one of the players on the big screen maybe the captain like his idol David Beckham. Weve always been England fans Kanes mum Kim has said. Whenever England were playing when the boys were younger we would always dress up do face painting and go to the local pub to watch games. It was always special to celebrate England games with friends and family. There were also many tears too! Kane has had the old place jumping with his tournament goals which have accounted for a healthy proportion of his record return  12 to be precise beginning with the six that swept him to the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup taking in the four at Euro 2020 all of which came in the knockout rounds and then the two at the 2022 World Cup also during the knockout phase. It is interesting to note that 33 of Kanes goals have been in qualification ties and only six in friendlies with the other three in the Nations League. Or that 49 have come with him as the captain. When Gareth Southgate first gave him the armband in a friendly against Scotland in June 2017 he responded by volleying a 93rdminute equaliser. How he has thrived on the responsibility. Harry Kane scores Englands late winner against Tunisia at the 2018 World Cup. Photograph Robbie Jay BarrattAMAGetty Images Kane cites the lastgasp headed winner against Tunisia in the opening group tie of the 2018 World Cup as one of his favourites. When Harry Maguire flicked on a Kieran Trippier corner Southgate was seen to shout Wheres Harry? Up popped Kane generating the power on the ball with a whip of his neck muscles. Oh theres Harry. It was surely bettered by the goal against Germany in the last 16 of the Euros the clinching second in the 20 win  a seismic triumph given the background. Since England beat West Germany at Wembley in the 1966 World Cup final they had won only eight knockout ties at major tournaments and only one had been against a major football power  the penalty shootout victory over Spain at Euro 96. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Here was a dose of redemption Kane a prominent redeemer. Kanes story has been heavy on proving people wrong on overcoming setbacks  his infamous release by Arsenal as an eightyearold the difficult loans at Norwich and especially Leicester the oneseason wonder jibes in 201415. Even before his showstopper against Germany he had been widely questioned after three groupstage blanks. Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2020. Photograph Kevin QuigleyEuro 2020 newspapers pool It has been a triumph of mentality as well as ability of hard work and remorseless focus. Watch him in a prematch warmup picking out the top corner in shooting drills again and again. Listen to what his teammates say about him in training how he picks out the top corner again and again. How he stays behind to keep on doing it. Kanes qualities seem to be distilled when he stands over a penalty. Eighteen of his England goals have come from the spot he has missed four although when he did so against Denmark in the Euro semifinal he scored on the rebound. There was no such reprieve when he lifted high against France in the World Cup quarterfinal last December  the lowest moment of his career. The next most successful England penalty converter has been Frank Lampard with nine. Rooney got seven from the spot Charlton three. And given what Kane went through against France there was an inevitability about his recordbreaking goal being a penalty. There are those who are a little bit sniffy about the number of penalties that Kane has scored as if they carry a lower value rather than representing the acid test of nerve. But did they complain for example when Kane scored from the spot against Colombia in the last 16 at the 2018 World Cup to put England 10 up? Kane fluffed his lines against France a miss  as he has suggested  that will haunt him forever. Only a tournament win with England you suspect would put that right. The individual history can stand apart.,It is one of Harry Kanes most treasured possessions the shirt he wore for his England debut.

Hamburg is a trading hub known for its anglophilia with close connections to Great Britain that go back centuries that were revived during the British occupation of the city after the second world war when the former enemy quickly turned into a close partner. When you take the long view at UKGerman relations this part of the kings trip is at least as important and meaningful as his appointments in the German capital. Those who criticise royal visits as constituting little more than expensive photoops fail to understand that not all symbolism is empty. On Friday the king will visit St Nikolai church in the centre of Hamburg and lay a wreath there with the German president FrankWalter Steinmeier. The symbolic importance of this ceremony can hardly be overstated. The church is a landmark of the city dating back to the middle ages. After a fire in 1842 it was rebuilt by the English architect Sir George Gilbert Scott who also built the Albert Memorial and the Foreign Office in London. In the otherwise very close historic relationship between Hamburg and Great Britain St Nikolai is a reminder of their darkest moment. During the devastating bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 by allied forces the church was damaged beyond repair. This attack codenamed Operation Gomorrah in reference to the biblical story of Genesis when God decided to punish the sinners of Gomorrah by making it rain fire from the sky is to this day etched into Hamburgs collective memory under a different name the fire storm. Between 25 July and 3 August 1943 the Royal Air Force flew a series of four night raids against Hamburg as part of its wider strategy of area bombing German cities. The aim was to demoralise the workingclass part of the population to cripple the armaments industry that was central to the German war effort and to bring civilian life to a halt. The US air force joined the attack with two daylight air raids mainly against targets in the harbour. The greatest damage was not done by the bombs themselves but the conflagration they caused on the ground. According to conservative estimates at least 34000 people died during this short series of attacks. Hamburg was largely reduced to rubble and nearly a million people fled the city. Among the victims of the attacks were thousands of forced labourers from central and eastern Europe who had been deported by the Nazis to Hamburg for work and who like the remaining Jews in the city were not allowed to take cover in the air raid shelters. After the attack entire districts of Hamburg were walled off and declared as death zones. The Nazis then forced inmates of the nearby Neuengamme concentration camp to find and defuse unexploded bombs clear the rubble and remove and bury the dead bodies. Hundreds of them died during this extremely dangerous and traumatic mission. Hamburg in 1943 after Operation Gomorrah. Photograph Galerie BilderweltGetty Images It is impossible to study the eyewitness reports from the summer of 1943 without feeling a sense of horror. But it would be deeply irresponsible to forget the context in which the attacks took place. This is why the ruin of St Nikolai is today a memorial not only to those who suffered in Hamburg in 1943 but to all victims of the war Germany started and fought with brutal disregard for civilian life exterminating vast parts of the Jewish population in Europe and bombing cities such as Warsaw London or Coventry without mercy. The exhibition situated in the vault of St Nikolai explains this context as well as the strategy of the Royal Air Force leadership under Air Marshal Arthur Harris who hoped that area bombing would make a decisive difference towards winning the war  a victory that was anything but certain in 1943. It also includes testimonies from some of the British airmen on duty many of whom feared for their own lives during the mission. The pilots and aircrew bombing German cities ran an extremely high risk of being shot down or crashing. More than 55000 of them died during the war. King Charles has been involved in furthering UKGerman reconciliation for decades as was his mother the late Queen Elizabeth II. During his last visit to Hamburg as Prince of Wales in 1995 he visited the mass grave at Ohlsdorf cemetery where thousands of the victims of Operation Gomorrah are buried. This time the King will come in his new role as head of state in a year that marks the 80th anniversary of a specific allied attack against Hamburg. The visit shows that the war is now so firmly in the past and the relationship between Britain and Germany so close that the King and the German president can afford to rise above the political controversies that have complicated the remembrance of the bombing campaigns in both countries for decades. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans  from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

In Germany the political far right has repeatedly tried to capture and weaponise the memory of the air war in a transparent and revolting attempt to weigh the suffering of civilians against Nazi Germanys guilt for the war and the Holocaust. It takes courage to remember. Facing up to historic reality in all its painful complexity is not the same as attributing blame or seeking absolution. To explain and understand is not to excuse or condemn. When you enter St Nikolai today the first thing you see is a Cross of Nails a gift from Coventry Cathedral together with a plaque from the citizens of Hamburg remembering the dead and emphasising that they do not forget the harm caused by their own madness. For the king to join in this remembrance is a very significant and much appreciated thing to do. At a time when many politicians all over the world like to pick and choose from history with the sole aim of suiting their narratives it matters. This article was amended on 30 March 2023 to remove a reference to the bombing of Guernica which happened in 1937 before the start of the second world war.,King Charles III will not only travel to Berlin during his state visit to Germany this week but also Hamburg the countrys second largest city and home to its biggest port.

She was a campaigner with an eye only for the subject and never for her byline. It was this that made her effective in the world. She wrote of her mother Marion Guttman a refugee from Nazi Germany in Five Houses an effortlessly elegant 2006 essay in Granta magazine. Marion she said lost her identity her nationality and a large fortune. In her the shock has engendered pragmatism rather than nostalgia. It did not engender pragmatism or nostalgia in her daughter.

Any detention without charge is unacceptable and that of children doubly so. In the London Review of Books she detailed how the law of joint enterprise could tangle the innocent as well as the guilty. In the Guardian and Observer and on television she repeatedly returned to the case of Ben Needham. He was the toddler who vanished from the Greek island of Kos in 1991. From the 1990s into the 2010s in print and on television she covered the story and detailed the complex lives of the family that had been left with that still unresolved mystery. She highlighted foreign prisoners in British jails and whether Gulf war syndrome in soldiers was the result of exposure to chemical weapons agents she interviewed Stephen Frears in the Oldie.

Over the years she contributed to many more papers magazines organisations and television companies. These included the Sunday Times the Daily Telegraph the Bureau of Investigative Journalism Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. From 2001 to 2015 she taught journalism at City University of London. And at City it was that ability to draw people in to make connections that marked her influence on generations of students.

My son said I looked like Pauline Fowler in EastEnders. I sometimes cover my driving mistakes with rude hand gestures but as a platinum blonde I had no need. Born in London Melanie was the second daughter of Colin McFadyean an international lawyer and wartime naval officer and Marion who arrived in England in 1937 and would later earn her living in everything from picture restoration to garden design. The couple divorced in 1960. Melanie was educated at Sherborne school for girls in Dorset but was expelled after a year and joined her sister Andrea at Cranborne Chase school in Wiltshire which has since closed. It was she wrote in Granta such a degenerate and lawless place that I had to go in search of the rules in order to break them. It took me two and a half years to get expelled.

A stunning team goal finished by Ella Toone had torn apart the Copa Amrica Femenina champions Brazil in the first half but Andressa Alvess injurytime strike forced a shootout. Goalkeeper Mary Earps would atone for her fumble conceding the goal by stopping Tamires strike and watching as Brazil captain Rafaelles shot smashed off the bar before Kelly sealed the victory in Englands first shootout since 2011. It was another test passed another box ticked off and another crowdpleasing result as England continued their march towards the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand which kicks off in 105 days. It was a strong starting XI from the England manager who had hinted that there would be less room for experimentation against Brazil and Australia than there had been at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. Excluding injuries she fielded a team very close to the one that will probably feature at the World Cup in July with Millie Brights absence allowing Alex Greenwood to start alongside centreback Leah Williamson and Jess Carter slotting in at leftback. Meanwhile Lauren James got the nod ahead of Kelly to start in place of longterm absentee Beth Mead. Leah Williamson and Mary Earps lift the Womens Finalissima trophy at Wembley. Photograph Tom JenkinsThe Guardian Six of the XI that started the Euro 2022 final last year remained. There were six changes from the Brazil team that secured an eighth Copa Amrica Femenina the day before the Lionesses Euros triumph. Brazil were without key players Marta Ludmila and Debinha for the trip to England though while the Copa Amrica top scorer Adriana was a surprise omission from the starting lineup. It is a testament to the impact of the Euros win that Wembley was awash with fans by lunchtime for the 7.45pm kickoff. It is an even bigger testament that that no longer feels strange. A soldout Wembley is the Lionesses new normal and it is accelerating the growth of the game beyond anyones wildest expectations. Investment support structural change and time has built the success on the pitch delivering the environment in which the players can thrive. Brazil meanwhile are still waiting for that lightbulb moment. Their manager Pia Sundhage pointed to that prior to the match saying it was time that Brazil steps up and lays the foundations for future success. On the pitch at Wembley it was Englands flair and not the Brazil teams that had the crowd drooling. A beautifully worked team goal in the 23rd minute was the result. It took five passes to take the ball from back to front and James was key releasing Lucy Bronze on the right. The fullback played a onetwo with Georgia Stanway before pulling the ball back into the middle of the box for Toone to glide in. Jamess inclusion ahead of an inform Kelly was both a surprise and expected at the same time. The 21yearold Chelsea forward has been in phenomenal form and the magic that makes her arguably the most technically gifted English footballer since Kelly Smith was on display against Brazil. Every time James gets on the ball no matter the space available or the players around her the casual ease with which she can shrug off an opponent wriggle free and provide the unexpected makes her a potent weapon. There was a sign of the bright England future of James not long after the halfhour mark with a flick on for Bronze who sent it back to her to lift over Letcia into the roof of the net. The move was beautiful but James was offside and the fine finish was consigned to the dustbin of history. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter Informative passionate entertaining.

The end wasnt particularly pretty Englands flair ditched for a more dogged performance and Wiegmans team were punished. It was an uncharacteristic error from Earps that led to the equaliser the goalkeeper fumbling a bouncing cross into the box allowing Andressa to poke in from close range to force a penalty shootout.

This was the only real entertainment on show invalid entertainment. There was one of these moments shortly before Englands opening goal as Harry Maguire chased back to retrieve a loose ball then just seemed to stop. Except it wasnt that. Maguire hadnt actually stopped. There he was still going still turning like a fullyladen container ship easing its way grandly out of port. Were still on. This was just Maguire attempting to sprint. Nothing came of it and Maguire wasnt really asked to chase again all game. He defended well otherwise showing his strengths in passing heading and reading the angles. But if these games leading towards Germany 2024 really are about refinement about elevating Englands level towards genuine rather than hopeful tournament favourites that slowmotion tableau football through a mild dose of horse tranquilliser was still probably one the most significant moments of a mismatched afternoon. This England team is evolving. It has deeper gears than at any stage in the last seven years. But it is also time for Gareth Southgate to make some final calculations to be ruthless when it comes to the balance of loyalty and weaknesses. And Maguire remains the most obvious knot to be untangled. It was a pretty useful few days for other reasons too as lateseason limbweary international breaks go. England have all but nailed a toptwo spot in the group. Some areas of quiet progress made in Qatar seem to have bedded in. There was even something fascinating and fun in the contrast of the two venues the first in Naples a place of strange energy fields and fishy sidestreets  the air doesnt just smell of puttanesca sauce it tastes of it  and a city where on match days nobody ever really seems to be totally in control of anything and the second at Wembley where stewarding has become ever more neurotic after the chaos of 2021 where a neighbourhood booze lockdown is now enforced by hivis squadrons where a piped voice tells you how to walk act move and where the ground had begun to empty out with 70 minutes gone. On the pitch there were some obvious signs of progress. Although this must as ever be filtered through the fact that looking at Southgates England is very much a SpeakMyTruth kind of affair a world where however you feel about Southgates achievements as manager thats what they are. Never mind facts history or context. It is an easy game to play. Made England better when they were dreadful? Wouldve happened anyway. Reached a final? Didnt win a final. Won in Italy? Fine. Win better in Italy win all the minutes of all the games. But Southgate himself seemed genuinely refreshed and replenished. This is not a trivial point. So much about teams and shared competitive will relates to how the people at the centre of it feel. Second and more tangible was the regearing of Englands midfield a longterm point of weakness that now looks like an area of strength. The threeman unit strangled Italy in the first half Jude Bellingham Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips establishing a suffocating white shield around halfway pressing cutting the angles stalling opposition attempts to build some rhythm. Jude Bellingham left and Declan Rice challenge Ukraines midfield during the Euro 2024 qualifiers. Photograph Justin TallisAFPGetty Images This is a midfield Southgate had wanted to use in Qatar. And while Bellingham is the obvious star and Rice had arguably his best England game in Naples Phillips is also a key part. Southgate was accused of the dreaded sin of loyalty for selecting him. But this happened because Phillips has the mobility and skill set to help make this shape work with all the referred benefits of fewer defenders on the pitch. That 433 is Southgate finding a way to loosen the tie tousle his hair and rev the throttle. It might take time. But it is the right kind of progress. One key England weakness an absence of control that led at times to seven defensive players on the pitch is being rounded out here. Which brings us back to Maguire. Southgate is often accused of being too loyal to his preferred players. To some degree this is another case of the truth being whatever you choose to see. On one hand Southgates key note of progress is creating a club culture abolishing the old fear divisions and insecurity. On the other we want him to drop players to pick only on form to give us new things to look at. Maguire has stayed in the team in part for these reasons. But he is a genuine problem now for England his lack of mobility an obvious weak spot just waiting to be exposed by the best team or if not skewing selection to hide it. And Southgate must know that this version of Maguire is a level below what this team can aim for. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

But he is also the slowest player on the pitch every time he plays and not just slow in foot race slow in anything that requires him to flex and spring. This immobility will cost England if not in obvious ways then in the problems with keeping a high defensive line and condensing the midfield. At times at Wembley John Stones could be seen urging Maguire forward when England had possession. Grudgingly Maguire complied already feeling vertigo. Perhaps there isnt a genuinely compelling leftsided centreback alternative. Fikayo Tomori has played well for Milan. Southgate seems to be concerned that he lacks Maguires strength and power in the air. Tomori also had two shaky games against Chelsea at just the wrong moment. But this point of weakness will continue to lurk more evident in a team that has fewer of them. Loyalty is good. Ruthlessness is also good and Southgate has been ruthless in some ways. Raheem Sterling has finally been eased out of an automatic starter spot. And Englands manager has no matter what he might say publicly been ruthless with Ben White who left the World Cup squad and wasnt picked for these games as an understandable consequence. Can Southgate now apply the other side of that hardheadedness? White is a centreback by trade. He is currently playing to a high standard every week for the Premier League leaders. On merit an English defender with a shot at winning the English league and in a role that is a point of weakness he deserves a chance to play for England. It is up to Southgate to make this work or at least to give it a chance. White or indeed any other potential replacement doesnt have to be a worldbeater. The central defence only needs to be quite good to be athletic and secure enough to make the team work slightly better. England have eight more games before the year is out. If Maguires own form doesnt improve there is plenty of time to fix this to be ruthless in just the right way.,At times during the opening halfhour of Englands slowburn 20 defeat of Ukraine the only real football on show was that very modern kind of nonfootball the things that happen in the strange dead time while everyone in the stadium waits for the assistant referee to raise the flag for offside.

Lee Carsleys side were bidding to sign off for Georgia with a fourth friendly win out of four having beaten Germany Italy and on Saturday thumping France 40. But Carsley changed all 10 outfield players for their last tuneup match and they had only a late Morgan GibbsWhite consolation from the penalty spot to show for a ragged display at Craven Cottage. It is not just the senior England side who have recent history with Croatia the under21s were on course for the quarterfinals at the last Euros when a lastgasp wonder strike from fullback Domagoj Bradaric knocked them out on goal difference despite a 21 win. Curtis Jones scored in that match and the Liverpool youngster had Englands first shot on target repelled by goalkeeper Dominik Kotarski after a cross by Manchester Citys Cole Palmer. The lively Palmer then teed up Tommy Doyle who could not recreate his spectacular longrange FA Cup winner for Sheffield United against Blackburn nine days ago with his shot this time flying over the crossbar. Instead Croatia took the lead in the 34th minute after debutant Rico Lewis was booked for bringing down Lukas Kacavenda outside the box. Martin Baturina stepped up to curl a superb 20yard freekick inside James Traffords near post. Carsley made just one change at halftime replacing Boltons onloan Manchester City keeper Trafford and handing West Broms Josh Griffiths a debut. But Griffiths first task was to face a penalty after Luke Thomas clumsily brought down Matija Frigan in the area. Dion Drena Beljo coolly sent Griffiths the wrong way from the spot to double Croatias lead. Griffiths did well to limit the damage with a smart pointblank save to deny Kacavenda and another fine stop to keep out Gabriel Vidovic. For the hosts Palmer and Jacob Ramsey both stung the hands of Kotarski who then pulled off a stunning save to keep out a header from the substitute GibbsWhite. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardians take on the world of football Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

The Gunners face an inform team with a formidable home record on Tuesday evening but the Swede sounded confident and pointed to his teams results in the group stage as a reason why they should approach the game in a positive frame of mind. Bayern have won 12 of their past 13 Champions League games at home and are on a run of 12 consecutive home victories in all competitions. Asked why Bayern are so difficult to face in Germany Eidevall said Mainly because they are a good team  but weve been playing against teams who have great home records to be fair such as Juventus and Lyon this season and we managed to draw in Turin and won in Lyon. So we have respect for that Bayerns good home record but should not fear it. Arsenal are looking to reach the semifinals for the first time since 2013 and Eidevall feels that a recent minibreak has helped the team to prepare well for the fixture. Arsenal have not played since beating Reading 40 on 12 March. We have tried to use it in the best way possible a mixture of getting some time off to recover but also to use the time as efficiently as possible to work on things in our game not only for this game but for the other games we have ahead of us he said. It has been really good to work with the squad and hopefully we can show tomorrow that we are well prepared. I have had a feeling lately that I am sharing less information with the players because I am more sure that we know what to do in those situations. Lets hope that is a good sign and not a sign of false security. Bayern Munichs Sarah Zadrazil said she was excited to play in the Allianz Arena.

As 10 defeats go this was the vaguely encouraging kind for Arsenal a performance of real energy and purpose that has set up a beautifully poised second leg at the Emirates Stadium next week. And amid their disappointment Arsenal now know they can hurt Bayern Munich can pin them back and starve them of the ball can put them under pressure and create chances. The burning question of course is whether Arsenal will manage to take any of them. Twentyfive shots came and went for them here seven of them to the luckless Stina Blackstenius. But Bayern really did need to be at their resilient best in a pulsating second half twice clearing off the line as an injurydepleted Arsenal turned up the heat against a team that has conceded just four league goals all season. And so Lea Schllers towering header proved the difference between the sides here even if the Bayern coach Alexander Straus suggested that on the balance of play 11 might have been a fairer result. This perhaps was the starkest point of difference between the two sides in a tight and taut game the value of a pure penaltybox assassin as opposed to the industrious but inefficient Blackstenius. Schller has added other notes and gears to her game in recent months becoming stronger off the ball and linking play more effectively but it is between the two posts that she still does her deadliest work. She has the potential to be one of the best in the world Strauss argued afterwards. I would not change her for anybody. As for Blackstenius it was another night of manual labour without too much artistry to accompany it. She gets a tough rap from many Arsenal fans for her lack of precision in front of goal but equally the absences of Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema for large parts of the season have placed a harsh burden on her. Clearly the confidence is not quite there at the moment which is probably not that surprising when you know that your club tried to smash its transfer record to sign Alessia Russo. And for the Swedish international it was another of those nearlybutnotquite kind of performances epitomised by the secondhalf chance in which she fatally hesitated eight yards out allowing Glodis Viggosdottir to steal in and block the shot. Does she work hard and create space for others? Sure. Is she good enough to lead the line in a Champions League quarterfinal? Right now probably not. There was a healthy dose of controversy too with both of Bayerns goalline clearances. The first saw a shirtpull on Rafaelle Souza in the buildup the second a potential backpass handball in the penalty area from goalkeeper Maria Luisa Grohs. Each time the Arsenal coach Jonas Eidevall howled and fumed on the sidelines each time the Macedonian referee chose not to consult the VAR. Obviously VAR is not working in the arena tonight or someone wasnt watching the pictures Eidevall grumbled. It highlights a couple of issues. The first is that VAR is only used from the quarterfinals. I dont know if that referee has ever used VAR before. Secondly goalline technology is not compulsory. Today it was not used because Bayern chose not to pay for it. Next week Arsenal have chosen to pay for it because we think it makes a fairer competition. But for all their frustration Arsenal acquitted themselves well under the highest pressure. The Allianz Arena was an imposing sight at kickoff with its rolling waves of noise its futuristic red lighting scheme the smell of bratwurst wafting across the 20000strong crowd. Bayern shaded the first half Schller brilliantly heading home Maxi Ralls cross after being allowed a couple of early sighters. Arsenals Frida Maanum holds off Klara Bhl and Saki Kumagai in Munich. Photograph Angelika WarmuthReuters Arsenal had taken a while to settle into the game but as the second half progressed they began to impose themselves. Eidevall brought on Victoria Pelova and moved Katie McCabe to leftback in an attempt to gain supremacy of the flanks. Lia Wlti and Kim Little began to pin back Georgia Stanway and Sarah Zadrazil in midfield. Caitlin Foord who was giving Rall a real test on the left wing clipped the post with a curling shot. These ultimately were the margins. Having weathered the storm Bayern looked a little more comfortable in the final minutes and perhaps both teams seemed to recognise that 10 was a disaster for nobody. Bayerns danger on the counterattack probably makes them slight favourites against an Arsenal team that will need to force the pace in the second leg. But for the home side the celebrations at full time were suitably restrained the cautious approval of a team who had seen enough here to know that their work is by no means done.,Down but not out.

https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/07/transatlantic-review-netflix-gillian-jacobs-anna-winger,Transatlantic review  theres a faint whiff of Allo Allo to this wartime drama,The incredible true story of WWII resistance fighters battling the Nazis in France could be epic Instead its tonally confused with a light comical touch more suited to a Sunday ITV slotThe true story of the Emergency Rescue Committee is perfect TV drama ,The true story of the Emergency Rescue Committee is perfect TV drama fodder American activist journalist Varian Fry ran an office in a Marseille hotel in 1940 working with a ragtag band of resistan 5061 chars,The true story of the Emergency Rescue Committee is perfect TV drama fodder. American activist journalist Varian Fry ran an office in a Marseille hotel in 1940 working with a ragtag band of resistance operatives US expats and the odd sympathetic diplomat to enact a grand plan help Jewish or antiNazi writers artists philosophers and other blacklisted individuals to escape persecution in Europe and emigrate to a fulfilling new life. In a coruscating riviera setting disparate people with a shared purpose band together to achieve something truly noble working in the flickering shadow of the Holocaust without the extreme violence of nazism coming close enough to force the narrative fully into the dark. It could be a great drama and Transatlantic  nearly is one. Cocreated with Daniel Hendler by Anna Winger the writer behind Deutschland 83 and Unorthodox Transatlantic doesnt match the kinetic thrills of the former or the intense characterisation of the latter. It has many competing elements but more than anything its a sunny adventure fully aware of the threatened horror that fuels it  but light enough in tone that you could almost imagine it going out on a Sunday evening on ITV. Our lead character is not Fry but one of those expats Mary Jayne Gold Gillian Jacobs. Flush with money wired over from Chicago by Daddy Gold is putting off returning home for as long as possible fearful of falling into a life of enervated posh housewifery finding cunning ways to use her wealth to help the refugees who camp on the beach at Marseille gives her life. Fry Cory Michael Smith meanwhile has a wife at home but is in love with his ERC colleague Thomas Amit Rahav  portraying Fry as gay mirrors the book the series is inspired by The Flight Portfolio by Julie Orringer. The novels take on Frys sexuality was seen as crass speculation when it was first reviewed in 2019 but less so a few weeks later when Frys son wrote to the New York Times to say Orringer was right. With Gold swiftly falling for dashing polyglot refugee Albert Hirschman Lucas Englander there is as much romance as there is daring heroism when the ERC gang hole up in a villa on the edge of town temporarily living with the likes of Max Ernst Andr Breton Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall as they try to get the illustrious fugitives on to a ship a plane or along a secret path through the Pyrenees. As a palatable history lesson Transatlantic is comprehensive. The culpability of America for the refugees plight is baldly set out Fry is driven by anger at how his attempts to report on antisemitic violence in Germany have been ignored in the States while the character of US consul Graham Patterson played by Corey Stoll as a heartless realpolitik merchant Henry Ford sold over 60000 Model Cs in Germany in the last five years! embodies how the thenneutral USA didnt let compassion compromise its selfinterest. As you might expect from the cocreator of Unorthodox the question of how some characters view their Jewishness  Hirschman is a man who rejected this part of his identity as a carefree young man before the Nazis forced him to reconsider  is intelligently handled. There are stimulating contemporary parallels too. The south of France isnt occupied by Hitlers troops but is run by the Naziadjacent Vichy collaborators who publicly complain of an illegal immigration crisis before coming up with a solution stop the boats. Transatlantic struggles however to weave its learning points elegantly into the drama to show rather than tell. Whether its the importance of the artists the political realities on the ground or the protagonists personal dilemmas what we need to know tends to arrive neatly packaged in speechy dialogue. One aspect of Golds character is that she ends up using her physical attractiveness in ways that demean her but if you didnt perceive that this often used to be the fate of female intelligence officers a supporting character is on hand to spell it out. This contributes to Transatlantics tonal problems. The daring rescue of the refugees and the two love stories within the ERCs ranks are potentially epic stories that dont feel epic taking place as they do amid peril that never feels all that perilous  because the setting shines the famous writers and artists are amusingly wacky and with the muted Jacobs slightly miscast in the lead role the rescuers are defined more by capering pluck than deathdefying courage. Some scenes with the bumbling cowards in the local police force have a faint whiff of Allo Allo! about them. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Whats On Free weekly newsletter Get the best TV reviews news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

Hornier than you could possibly imagine. Rutting. Humping. Basically just exactly what youd see in a nature documentary but with people from Basildon instead of wild animals. Please stop. I cant.

And which countries ranked lower than Britain? Germany scored 6.09 Switzerland scored 5.87 and Austria scored 5.56. Why do you ask? Oh no reason. Its not like Im going to immediately apply for residency there or anything. Listen dont be such a prude. This survey is great news. It is? Yes! You know how theres a trend of young people not having much sex any more maybe because Covid disrupted the shaping of their attitudes or maybe because theyre too distracted by other devices or maybe because of slow generational change? Yes. Well not here baby. Britain is almost singlehandedly bucking the trend. While globally there seems to be a downturn in sex drive among Gen Z in this country theyre hornier than anyone else. Their sex drive according to the survey is a whopping 6.96. My God. I know. It means that young British people are hornier than the average Italian person. This is unprecedented. Did the survey teach us anything else? It did. It taught us that over65s have a subAustrian sex drive of 5.16 and that men are on average 12 hornier than women. You know none of this seems particularly British. Well I could tell you about another recent survey by Durex that revealed men orgasm four times as often as women and that 11 of women were disappointed about this but had got used to it. There we go.

The use of egg as a binding medium for pigments a form of paint known as egg tempera has a long history turning up in works including the mural paintings of the Palace of Nestor in Pylos dating to 1200BC. But in the 15th century there was a shift in European paintings towards using oil as a binder instead  an approach favoured by early Netherlandish painters such as Jan van Eyck. Despite the shift egg has been found in the works of Old Master artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci  with the formers Lamentation over the Dead Christ among those featuring the use of egg within oil paint. Now scientists say they have new insights into why such artists might have added the ingredient to their oil paints. The egg is used for modification and finetuning of paint properties said Dr Patrick Dietemann of the Doerner Institut in Germany. Writing in the journal Nature Communications Doerner and colleagues report how they explored the issue by creating three types of paint. The first was made from pigment ground with linseed oil the second used the same mixture but with the addition of a few drops of egg yolk and the third was created by mixing a pigment with a solution of diluted egg yolk  after drying this was ground and dispersed with oil. The results reveal how yolk can influence the stiffness of the paint depending upon how it is added and the pigment used. By changing preparation technique you can change the properties of the paint. Thus two paints with the same composition can have different microstructures and this will result in different properties said Dr Ilaria Bonaduce an author of the study from the University of Pisa. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean free every weekday morning Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

In addition the stiffness of the lower layers of paint prevents the paint surface from cracking or wrinkling during drying said Prof Norbert Willenbacher an author of the study from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The team also discovered humidity had less of an influence on the properties of lead white paint when the paint was made by drying the pigment with egg yolk before grinding and adding oil. The yolk protects the paints from undesirable changes caused by absorption of moisture from the environment because the water is captured in the protein layer surrounding the pigments Willenbacher said. The study also reveals egg yolk generally increased the drying time of paints a feature the researchers attributed to its antioxidant properties which also help to protect the paints from degrading over time. While the team said it was not possible to exclude unintentional additions of egg to the oil paints Bonaduce said it was likely the Old Master artists were well aware of the benefits of the ingredient. I am quite convinced that they did not know the chemical and physical explanations of what they were doing but they knew very well what they were doing.,It pays to go to work on an egg when painting with oils researchers have found as the addition of yolk can prevent wrinkling yellowing and problems with humidity.

Its really important to us as players Hemp said speaking before the Finalissima against the South American champions Brazil at Wembley on Thursday. Its been in discussions for years and its important we feel confident when were playing. This is a massive step in the right direction and Nike have taken a lot from our discussions in the past to make it real. Thats great because obviously we can now feel comfortable when sometimes we might not have been if it was your time of the month. Its great to move away from the white shorts not having that worry and focusing on the game. A number of teams in the Womens Super League have swapped white shorts for darker colours in response to discussion with players about how wearing white shorts makes them feel while on their periods including Hemps club Manchester City who switched to burgundy shorts. For us at City to move away from that helped other teams to move away from it Hemp said. You dont just want your own team but everyone in the environment to feel safe and comfortable. Its great to have that and be able to start something where things have changed. You feel as players you are being listened to and you are safe and comfortable. West Hams Parker said Anything that relieves the mental stress from a player is a good thing. If its one less thing to worry about then why not? Hemp who started in the European Championship final last summer in front of a soldout Wembley crowd of 87192 said she is looking forward to the next few years with England despite Uefa announcing that Switzerland  where the largest stadium has a 38512 capacity  will host Euro 2025.

Looking forward to the future it might hold 38000 but theres still going to be so many fans that will be there. Hopefully it will be packed out and so many people watching from back home. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Moving the Goalposts Free weekly newsletter Informative passionate entertaining.
