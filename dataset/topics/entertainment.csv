of Londons Chinatown was once one of the most beautiful in the city Now its one of the most dynamic As Xu a Taiwanesestyle tea house it was a stage set of 1920s polish and clean lines The walls were partpanelled in block marquetry and there were booths upholstered in leather the colour of caf au lait There were sexy wall sconces and flashes of marble trim and tiny private dining rooms built cleverly into the small space You came here for crisply fried pork buns and pleated dumplings in puddles of jadegreen broth It was at first shocking to see all of that stripped out to make way for Speedboat Bar Now the downstairs walls are tiled in an institutional sludge green Upstairs theyre painted yellow against the turquoise window frames Theres a pool table to drink powerful cocktails over while you play and giant TVs screening sports There are stainlesssteel tables and dozens of tiny pictures of Bangkok street life as if acquired over decades of trade rather than put up for the opening a couple of months ago And oh the clamour Top marks for upholstering the underneath of the tables to help deaden the sound Clams arrive in a broth thick with sweet chilli jam and outrageously blousy aromatic Thai basil clams in chilli broth Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer An 80s soundtrack of Depeche Mode and Soft Cell accompanies the delivery of whisky sodas and King Kushti lager by the bottle I order a bowl of deepfried chicken skins the brown of a velour sofa They are still warm and curled in on each other and an irresistible saltysour As I scarf the lot I finally clock that this new space is just as clever and just as beguiling an exercise in restaurant stagesetting as its previous incarnation This makes sense The restaurant may have changed but the business behind it remains the same Both involved the Sethi brothers company JKS Restaurants They have an impressive spread of ventures from the Mayfair Indian Gymkhana through the Iranian kebab house Berenjak to the Bao group of which the now closed Xu was a part JKS has many talents One of them is choosing their chefrestaurateur partners With Speedboat Bar its the British chef Luke Farrell who has been bouncing back and forth between Dorset London and Thailand for many years now investigating southern Thai cooking He brings in cuttings of Thai herbs and plants to grow here in glasshouses on his fathers farm because they are diminished by being imported frozen Warm and curled in on each other and an irresistible saltysour chicken skins Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer The first restaurant he opened with JKS was Plaza Khao Gaeng a southern Thai caf in the upstairs space above their Arcade food court at the base of Centrepoint There he serves fierce dishes of dryfried pork or sea bream with permutations of chillies wild galangal and makrut limes Its food to make you gasp and blink and go back for more Farrell has described Speedboat Bar as his tribute to the fullon cafs along the neongilded Yaowarat Road in Bangkoks Chinatown Everything here is vivid and candycoloured and maximum wattage including the food Look at the bright orange sweetsour dipping sauce with the sweetcorn fritters the golden lacy batter pitted with the brilliant yellow of corn kernels Or theres the ludicrously green prawn ceviche served whole and peeled apart from the tail which can act as a handle Use it to help you dredge the prawn through the rugged lake of lime chilli and fish sauce that makes your lips tingle and your brow sweat Speedboats homage to the restaurants of Bangkoks Chinatown is felt in various ways A salad of pickled mustard greens comes layered with slices of dense deepred winddried Chinese sausage Drunkards seafood and beef noodles is so named our Thai waiter explains because it was first devised as a hangover cure from whatever was hanging around in the fridge Its a good reason to get liquored up There are broad ribbon noodles and slices of quickfried beef and curls of squid in a thickened sweet soy Cantonesestyle sauce If youre with nonmeat eaters watch out for the Naem fried rice mined with tiny cubes of pork Introduce some of the sweet vinegary dressing from the saucer on the side Allow sliced red and green chillies according to taste Ludicrously green prawn ceviche Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer Other things come from the more obviously Thai side of the ledger Clams steamed open in their shells for maximum suckage arrive in a broth thick with sweet chilli jam and outrageously blousy aromatic Thai basil Chunks of aubergine served in a similar sauce are cooked down until their skins are crinkled and their flesh creamy A crispy pork curry walks both sides of the line The sliced meat has crackling with the crunch and shatter that I associate with Cantonese roast meats The dark brown sauce has the coconut and palm sugar sweetness that I associate with a massaman Taken dish by dish its obviously huge fun To keep to the retro 60s vibe each one is like a frame from an old Batman comic fight scene Kapow Wham Biff The problem is that cumulatively like the bar upstairs throbbing and thronging with young people necking those whisky sodas it can all become a little relentless Wave after wave of sweet and fiery and sour crashes on the wilder shores of your tongue This may however be down to the nature of reviewing which demands overordering for I am nothing if not conscientious Perhaps come here for a beer and just a couple of plates and then move on Outside is a ropedoff area of the pavement with red plastic stools around the tables On warm summer nights people passing by will want to be inside that rope rather than outside A flaky golden rectangle pineapple pie Photograph Sophia EvansThe Observer There is just one dessert a flaky golden rectangle of deepfried pineapple pie It reminds me fondly of a McDonalds apple pie Its in keeping with the louche laidback mood If you want something else remember youre in Soho There are dessert alternatives Speedboat Bar sits alongside places like Kiln Som Saa and the now closed District in Manchester restaurants created by British chefs with a deep fascination with Thai traditions They are not a replacement for restaurants like the recently reviewed Thairun Supawan Big cities have space for many things When presented with the vivacity of Speedboat Bar the style is completely irresistible News bites The Manchesterborn chain Rudys Pizza Napoletana which has opened over a dozen sites across the UK since its 2015 launch in Ancoats has announced a new 8000 sq ft outpost on Portland Street in the city As well as space for 120 diners it will be home to Rudys Pizza Academy a training school in the craft of pizza and an interesting response to a shortage of kitchen staff

In a posh hotel in London Were not celebri,We dont stay in posh hotels in London says Jon Richardson In a posh hotel in London Were not celebrities really are we adds his wife Lucy Beaumont Were just us We dont really hang out in Lond 7638 chars,We dont stay in posh hotels in London says Jon Richardson In a posh hotel in London Were not celebrities really are we adds his wife Lucy Beaumont Were just us We dont really hang out in London and go to premieres She pauses Like the one were going to tonight Whats this Have I trapped Britains bestloved comedy couple in an instance of rank hypocrisy Richardson and Beaumont for those unfamiliar are standup comics and in Richardsons case panel show royalty as an exteam captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats who also cohost Channel 4s Jon  Lucys Odd Couples casting judgment on other celeb relationships from their lofty celebrelationship pinnacle They are also stars of the hit mockumentary Meet the Richardsons which chronicles their married life  or a fictional version thereof That show majors in the tension between their fame and their glamourfree domestic life  and its the VIP launch of its new series that justifies all this current London luxury albeit for one day only If the show is to be believed theyll soon be back in the north of England squabbling being parents being neighbours and trying to catch a break in the rough and tough entertainment world But is the show to be believed None of it is real says Beaumont But we enjoy making it seem as if it is Another pause But then some things are If were successful and happy and calm you lose that fundamental element of comedy The series started life when its producer saw Jon and Lucy grumbling at each other on a TV show called Married to a Celebrity He proposed a mockumentary following the couple around at a particular moment in their shared lives We lived in a little village in West Yorkshire in the middle of nowhere says Beaumont Neither of us worked much I was getting back into things after having a daughter and you Jon were doing bits But we were cut off And we were hanging out with our neighbours Those neighbours were cast in the show alongside Beaumonts largerthanlife mum the playwright Gill Adams and a roster of celeb pals Rob Beckett Johnny Vegas David Tennant appearing as themselves while Jon and Lucy made hapless efforts to rebuild their TV careers What has emerged over four series is a show thats carved out its own comic niche in the same ballpark as Curb Your Enthusiasm but with added talking heads droll cutaways and moments of unadulterated documentary says Richardson amid the semiscripted larks Most importantly its a high gagrate comedy show he says and when hes filming if I can see the crew arent laughing its not in the show They should be laughing Beaumont agrees I was getting annoyed with comedydrama I felt like sitcom needed to get back to making people laugh every three lines It is Beaumont  also the cocreator of the recent Channel 4 comedy Hullraisers about her home town  who writes the show alongside Peter Kays Car Share cocreator Tim Reid Northern exposure  Jon and Lucy meet their public in a scene from series four of Meet the Richardsons Photograph Vishal SharmaUKTVJames Stack Richardsons role he tells me is to be humiliated and look embarrassed Meet the Richardsons provides him with ample opportunity as he bursts into flames at a childrens party while dressed as a monkey or  in the new series  disappoints his comedy hero Ben Elton Is it right to assume his haplessness and Beaumonts career anxiety are all exaggerated for comic effect she has after all been nominated for a Bafta for her performance Thats Lucys skill as a writer says Richardson To understand that sitcom is driven by a need If were successful and happy and calm you lose that fundamental element of comedy That said we went to Center Parcs recently says Beaumont and a lady in the toilet said to me Isnt it nice that your husbands let you be on telly with him And youre just like OK I can now go away and write a scene Even in real life she says I very much still feel like the jealous wife whos hungry for a career But she also feels  much to the consternation of the shows publicist within earshot  that Meet the Richardsons is becoming too careerfocused The new series is too workbased she says Its my least favourite You liked it in series one shoots back Richardson and you havent liked it since Were missing a bit of dock pudding says Beaumont  referring to the shows second episode when the duo judged the real not fictional World Dock Pudding cookery competition in Hebden Bridge I was like this is exactly what I want to be making says Beaumont I like it less when the show recreates a celebrity thing weve been to  I like it when were interacting with real people Watching the show you cant help but wonder how it affects the couples reallife relationship and whether there might be aspects of their private life theyd prefer to keep behind closed doors Richardson says not really In series four I shit myself in the car So its difficult to know what I would veto skip past

reality Their TV house is not their real house Their TV daughter is an actor Not that their fans see it that way Because were playing ourselves says Beaumont I do think people come up to us more in public and assume they know us Definitely Cast away  Jon and Lucy have a meeting at UKTV about the new series in Meet the Richardsons Photograph Adam LawrenceUKTVJames Stack Thats not a bad thing she says  and Richardson too can see upsides to their unusual televised lives Every couple argues he says but we have an end product for our arguments We hone them then put them on TV And then its like Oh perhaps we werent arguing  perhaps we were just working on a routine Are they concerned about becoming more famous as a couple than as individuals As long as I can do standup which is such a pure selfish moment I dont mind says Richardson now celebrating 20 years as one of the UKs finest comic curmudgeons As long as I can tour and thats just my voice  well thats such a privilege Beaumont too nominated best newcomer at the Edinburgh fringe back in 2014 is embarking on a standup tour Its title The Trouble and Strife suggests no great desire to slough off the Richardsons connection This first foray into standup in a decade has raised old demons for Beaumont which her new career as a successful TV writer has yet to slay I know now she says that what put me off standup was the horrific misogyny that I suffered Only a decade ago she says promoters still didnt want to book female comics comperes introduced them with an apology and youd get on stage and the audience would instantly look embarrassed before you said anything Or they would use you as the time to go to the toilet It led to her convincing herself that I dont belong here Im not good enough Im not funny Four series of a hit TV show later she says I still have all that in my head whenever I do anything And its really frustrating that men dont So my thing with the new tour is I just want to make it  like Meet the Richardsons before it  the funniest thing it can be Meet the Richardsons starts 6 April 10pm Dave  UKTV Play,entertainment

the attacking sides goal should stand says David Paradine I cant see the logic in that as VAR was introduced to cut down on the mistakes made in the awarding andor not awarding goals I understand that you may not like VAR but it was not introduced on a whim but was campaigned for over the years both inside and outside the press VAR is not perfect mistakes have been made but on balance the refereeing mistakes that it rectifies far exceed these mistakes PreVAR we were above 90 correct decisions so I dont think compromising the flow of the game and ability to celebrate goals the greatest

https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2023/apr/02/lula-brazil-victory-happiness-possible-material-conditions,Lulas victory changed how I think about happiness  and made me believe it is possible for all  Yara Rodrigues Fowler,This supposedly intangible romantic thing is in fact rooted in something concrete and quantifiable our material conditionsulliIn a series of short essays writers consider what happiness means to them now after the reckoning of the past few yearsli,On 30 December last year Jair Bolsonaro lost to Luiz Incio Lula da Silva in Brazils presidential election making Bolsonaro the first incumbent to fail to be reelected in Brazil since redemocratis 4541 chars,On 30 October last year Jair Bolsonaro lost to Luiz Incio Lula da Silva in Brazils presidential election making Bolsonaro the first incumbent to fail to be reelected in Brazil since redemocratisation A week after Lulas inauguration Brazils congress presidential palace and supreme court were invaded by thousands of supporters of Bolsonaro They proceeded to smash the windows artworks and computers of the buildings that symbolise Brazilian democracy I mention this not because the invasion of Braslia made me happy it did not or because Lulas election made me happy it did but because Lulas campaign slogan was sem medo de ser feliz which translates literally as without fear of being happy or put more succinctly unafraid of happiness In his first speech as president Lula began by promising every Brazilian three meals a day a job and access to healthcare and education He went on to promise zero deforestation indigenous land rights and the recreation of the ministries for racial equality women and culture Lulas slogan acknowledges something we can be loth to admit That happiness  this supposedly intangible romantic thing  is directly linked to the most quantifiable and decidedly unethereal aspects of lives our material conditions It may be an obvious thing to say but it is our material conditions that determine how long and how hard our lives are what we can do with them and where Sem medo de ser feliz argues for better material conditions not simply for their own sake  or for the sake of increased productivity or fairness  but for the sake of happiness It was not a given that things would be this way My Brazilian mother and British father married in London in 1988 the year Brazil passed a new constitution after two decades of military dictatorship I was born in 1992 and grew up surrounded by postcold war political optimism one of the earliest things I can remember is my reception teachers celebrating Labours victory in 1997 Until the financial crash of 2008 the defining mood of my childhood and adolescence was that things could only get better However as an adult the material conditions experienced by my generation are worse than those experienced by our parents at our age Most of us rent at a time when rented housing has become harder to secure bidding wars and payments of a years rent upfront are now commonplace in London and of increasingly low quality the Times reports that only 10 of flatshares in London have a communal area Inflation is increasing and wages are not and in many sectors pensions are also being slashed Childcare provision is collapsing and the climate crisis only worsens When I think of myself and my friends it is obvious that our happiness is determined by our material conditions One friend cant live on the same continent as his longterm partner because he doesnt earn enough to sponsor her visa Another puts off having a baby because its too expensive Another has been evicted for the second time in a year because their landlord has decided to sell Others spend the working day in discomfort because they cant afford to heat their homes These kinds of stories are not exclusive to young people theyll be familiar to people of all ages especially people with dependants people who do not own their own homes and do not have family wealth In terms of happiness the effect is both daytoday deprivation and something qualitatively different more prolonged We are less free Lulas victory has made me feel freedom is possible His strategy was to build a broad coalition of Black Indigenous gay bisexual transgender and workingclass Brazilians He did this by promising to improve the material conditions of all these groups The logic here was the opposite of austeritystyle scarcity which pits one marginalised group against another whether thats trans and cis women or workingclass people from migrant and nonmigrant backgrounds The logic of Lulas broad coalition is that if the most vulnerable in society are better off everyone else will be better off too It asks Brazilians to dream of freedom for each other  happiness for all  instead of fighting each other for scraps Happiness then to me is first and foremost a case of material conditions  of good warm housing education healthcare and a job Because having these material needs met means freedom to live well and as you wish The way I see it sem medo de ser feliz means being unafraid of the happiness of others too It means letting go of the fear that if the material conditions of another group of people improve that the group I belong to will suffer To me being unafraid of happiness means believing in freedom for us all,entertainment

in recent years TV shows that set themselves in these places so 95 of all TV shows have been knowingly shy about it as if they are an Oxford undergraduate refusing to admit their dad is rich yes these

if only because they succeeded in getting the basics right Eddie Howes impressive side did not even have to work hard for their goals and as the match drew to a close it was hard to know what more West Ham need to see before accepting that David Moyess time is up Out of the bottom three on goal difference West Ham have ignored the obvious for too long and are paying for their failure to act This was a humiliation for Moyes The Scot watched helplessly as his side were given a lesson in focus by opponents cantering towards the Champions League after their fourth consecutive win He listened grimly as the last few home fans left in the stadium applauded when Newcastles crowing supporters taunted Moyes with chants of Youre getting sacked in the morning The travelling Toon Army had a point and the atmosphere turned toxic Moyes was booed off after a rotten defensive display from West Ham and the onus is on the coowner David Sullivan to act There can be no excuses Everything was too easy for Newcastle as they exposed Moyess dreadful fullbacks Thilo Kehrer and Emerson Palmieri and accepted the gifts from West Hams centrebacks Kurt Zouma and Nayef Aguerd whose shocking performance was summed up by the moment when he killed off any chance of a comeback by handing Callum Wilson his second goal of the evening 22 seconds into the second half It was Wilson who had got the ball rolling in the sixth minute punishing slack marking after Sad Benrahma neglected his defensive duties and gave Allan SaintMaximin too much time to cross There was a vast difference in application between the sides Newcastle were jaded after their win over Manchester United and Howe was not happy with their level during a pulsating first half but their resilience meant they tightened their grip on third place I dont think we were perfect Howe said West Ham made it a good game But we took our chances When you reflect back to Sunday the emotion that took out of us we looked a little fatigued We were great in elements of our game Mentally we got through it and got a massive result Every positive result strengthens our position Nothing is going to be decided short term The same applies at the opposite end of the table West Ham had glimpsed a chance to climb but they cannot relax after their first home defeat since December Their away form is dreadful and they still have to host Arsenal United and Liverpool They could do with a result at Fulham on Saturday Joelinton fires home in the 90th minute of the game to seal a 51 win for Newcastle Photograph John WaltonPA At least the early signs had been encouraging for West Ham They were direct when they attacked and could have led when Jarrod Bowen tore down the right inside the first minute held off Dan Burn and produced a cutback so inviting it almost made Bruno Guimares turn the ball into his own net Guimares was relieved to see the ball bounce off a post then for Declan Rice to hammer a shot over West Hams wounds were selfinflicted There were groans when Kehrer misjudged a long ball and conceded a needless corner in the sixth minute West Hams concentration faded The corner was cleared as far as SaintMaximin who

back West Ham responded Michail Antonio and Lucas Paqueta both going close Fabianski stopped Wilson and West Ham took note of Nick Pope receiving treatment Antonio stopped Newcastles goalkeeper coming for Bowens corner in the 39th minute and Zoumas header dragged West Ham back into it West Ham were energised by the goal albeit a little fortunate not to lose Emerson for a foul on Jacob Murphy They were still too erratic West Ham were not equipped to deal with Newcastles aggression The third goal summed it up Aguerd received a pass from Fabianski dithered and lost possession to Murphy who presented Wilson with an open goal Out of the window went Moyess halftime instructions Newcastle looked for more Murphy and SaintMaximin testing Fabianski West Hams shape was gone Fabianski miscontrolled Guimaress ball and Isak lobbed in the fourth The home sections emptied out Those who stayed could at least appreciate Joelintons fine finish for Newcastles fifth in added

said was a good pair of ears Stein who has died aged 80 might have added indefatigable enthusiasm a streak of opportunism and a shrewd business brain all of which he deployed in a career that saw him sign the deals that launched the careers of Madonna the Ramones Talking Heads kd lang and many others Those artists enjoyed their first hits on Sire Records the label Stein cofounded in 1966 and with which he remained synonymous even after his company had been absorbed by the Warner Music group By the time he stood down in 2018 unhappy with corporate politicking Steins achievements had long since earned him a place among the finest record men  as they were known  of his generation I have no easily definable skills or talents Im a hit man a record business entrepreneur he wrote in the introduction to his autobiography Siren Song in 2018 He played no instrument and had no technical knowledge for which he was ultimately grateful believing it might have got in the way of an appreciation of artists who could not be judged by conventional musical standards Seymour Stein centre with Madonna and the Talking Heads frontman David Byrne at the 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction dinner in New York Photograph KMazurWireImage The story of how Stein acquired the US rights to the thenunknown British band Depeche Mode for his label typified his modus operandi based on instinct and energy One day in 1980 he picked up the latest issue of a British music paper in his New York office and read about a new group signed by a UK contact Daniel Miller to his Mute Records label On a hunch he grabbed his passport booked a ticket to London on Concorde and went straight from the airport to meet the group in Basildon Essex their home town an hours drive east of London I signed them on the spot he remembered Their subsequent success made them one of a string of British bands whose records he released in the US When his rivals called him an anglophile it was not always he recalled meant as a compliment But it was British musicians from the Climax Blues Band to the Smiths who provided a bedrock for his business To sign Madonna Ciccone in 1982 he summoned the singer to his bedside at the hospital where he had undergone heart surgery Having listened to her demo tape he offered the 24yearold 45000 for three singles with the option to release an album Going on to sell more than 60m albums in the US alone while helping to reshape feminism for a new generation of young women she was his greatest success Seymour Stein with Michael Jackson in 2003 Photograph Sipa

Poland and Ukraine His father was employed in Manhattans garment industry while his mother worked at her familys market in Coney Island A heart murmur in infancy kept him away from sports at Lafayette high school where he discovered that he preferred applying his prodigious memory to Billboard magazines charts of current bestselling pop records than to his lessons The love of music was kindled by listening to the records brought home by his older sister During a summer holiday he talked his way into an internship at Billboards offices on 47th Street and Broadway It was there that he met Syd Nathan the myopic asthmatic choleric boss of King Records the label of James Brown based in Cincinnati In 1961 Nathan suggested that he shorten his surname and offered him a job asking Do you want to be a spectator or do you want to be in the game It was at King that Stein learned from the ground up how the record business really worked His knowledge would be expanded while working for George Goldner another oldtime record man at the Red Bird label where the ShangriLas and the Dixie Cups were the hit acts There he met the songwriter and producer Richard Gottehrer with whom he founded Sire

pounce on the Ramones with their twominute blasts of brattish attitude and the cooler artschool rock of Talking Heads From the UK came Echo and the Bunnymen Soft Cell and the Pretenders whose American singer Chrissie Hynde was impressed by Steins extraordinary recall of lyrics old and new As well as continuing to sign emerging acts  many of them from the UK such as My Bloody Valentine Aphex Twin and Everything But the Girl  Stein also played a significant role in the later careers of established stars Brian Wilsons eponymous first solo LP was released on Sire in 1988 the following year Lou Reeds artistic momentum was revived by the first of a series of Sire albums titled New York While on a constant search for new music Stein used his fortune to eat well and to collect art and antiques

he was inducted in 2005 He and Linda Adler were married in 1971 shortly after she had recovered from the shock of his announcement that he was gay Their formidable and often turbulent partnership

model for several preRaphaelite artists in the mid19th century After dying prematurely aged 32 Elizabeth Siddal was marked down for decades as a depressive and laudanum addict and was portrayed as such in Ken Russells 1967 BBC film Dantes Inferno  named after her husband Dante Gabriel Rossetti More recently she has been mythologised in several TV dramas and novels  even as a vampire victim Only now with The Rossettis exhibition opening on 6 April at Tate Britain will Siddal finally be judged for what she really was and achieved  a considerable artist in her own right Admittedly she had some bouts of poor health and suffered not surprisingly after giving birth to a stillborn daughter in 1861 However this exhibition with several previously unseen works will show Siddal as an independent woman who was not just a talented artist but also had a strong influence on the career of Rossetti Siddal was for so long considered as either just a model or as a derivative artist who simply followed the male preRaphaelites says Carol Jacobi curator of The Rossettis This is so inaccurate Siddal was untrained as an artist as a teenager working in clothes shops in central London where she taught herself to design dresses She was introduced to the preRaphaelites just as the group formed in 1849 before meeting Rossetti and becoming the model in his Rossovestita portrait In 1852 she sat for Millaiss Ophelia and other preRaphaelites such as William Holman Hunt She then began to draw and paint herself encouraged by Rossetti and her patron John Ruskin who gave her an allowance She also wrote poetry And yet during the 1850s as she began a relationship with Rossetti  though one which it is not thought was consummated until their marriage in 1860  her work was dismissed by the preRaphaelites as a pale imitation of Rossetti There were even claims that Rossetti helped paint her watercolours Regarded as an appendage to her husband she remained unknown during her lifetime outside the small and bitchy preRaphaelite circle However The Rossettis featuring 17 of her drawings and watercolours along with Jan Marshs forthcoming biography Elizabeth Siddal Her Story plus new research by Glenda Youde a York University historian highlight her as a skilled artist Dante Gabriel Rossettis portrait of Elizabeth Siddal Photograph ArchivartAlamy They also prove that she had a real influence on Rossetti by comparing and contrasting the work of the two artists in the exhibition They were together after all in the same studio says Youde You can see her effect on the style in paintings which Rossetti did himself either during her lifetime or especially afterwards This view is supported by Marsh In many cases it was Rossetti who was adopting and responding to her ideas and

several kept inside a leatherbound book that in 1862 Rossetti buried beside her body in Highgate cemetery in north London Seven years later the book was removed after the tomb was controversially opened Owned for many years by the University of Delaware in the US a loose sheet of paper with Rossettis original crossingsout and changes for The Portrait will be seen for the first time at the Tate Alongside will be Rossettis most famous portrait of Siddal  Beata Beatrix After her death Rossetti asked a friend to photograph about 60 of her drawings as another memory of her Displayed at the Tate will be three pages of this album plus some glass negatives again not shown before There is however one unsolved mystery Siddal is known to have completed one selfportrait  a rendering showing her red locks and stern expression Siddal painted it in 1853 but it has not been seen publicly for more than a century although it was photographed about 50 years ago This photograph is in the exhibitions catalogue Both Marsh and Youde are convinced that someone in the Rossetti family either in the UK or Italy has it Maybe this exhibition will inspire the owner to let it be seen publicly

toughlooking fellow but theres a sadness about him  hes up against this thing that he cannot do anything about it said Joseph He included a reference to the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George an honour that was criticised in 2020 because it includes the image of Saint Michael standing on the neck of a chained Black man portrayed as a devil In Josephs portrait Saint Michael is replaced by Muhammad Ali in the famous pose he made when he knocked out Sonny Liston in their second fight in May 1965 while the devil is replaced by Saint Michael He said Johnson wouldnt have fought any Black

leaden quotation of medieval art thats neither properly medieval nor bitingly modern Although this exhibition strives to set her verse alongside his art theres only so far you can go with bringing literature into the gallery via poems printed on walls Her steady quiet voice is drowned out by his lurid paintings of lusciouslipped beauties It looks as if DG never tried to draw anyone or anything freshly from life ever His pseudoRenaissance paintings are heavily worked up concoctions of symbolist erotica  and it turns out his drawings are like that too When he sketches his models who are his lovers he never sticks with what he sees but transfigures them in abstracted simplified lines Not that hes an abstract artist Just an emptily idealising one Surely the reason why he never completed Found is that he knew it was an awful painting The PreRaphaelite Brotherhood were a bunch of soso male artists who got together in 1848 to dress up their art in the borrowed robes of 15thcentury religious fervour and promote themselves as social saviours But the wall text will have us believe they were revolutionaries who wanted to express themselves authentically with art and poetry based on lived experience and nature that they were a group of young men and women in spite of stressing Brotherhood in their name Thus were told that John Everett Millaiss 1850 watercolour A Baron Numbering his Vassals actually depicts the class conflicts of 1840s Britain Really It looks like a placid portrayal of medieval folk to me The show pushes its exaggerated political claims for the preRaphaelites to absurdity in an extended exploration of Rossettis unfinished painting Found in which a woman of the streets who has collapsed against a wall is saved from death by a rustic In a series of halfpainted halfbaked canvases Rossetti dwells on the sensual face of his model Fanny Cornforth in a way that ludicrously undermines the supposed social message of the work The exhibition takes it all with leaden literalism as a radical revolutionary indictment of Victorian capitalism In reality its a collision between Rossettis erotic narcissism and his attempt to create a conscientious painting Surely the reason he never completed Found is because he knew it was awful Dante Gabriel Rossettis Proserpine Photograph Matt Greenwood Tate If there was a preRaphaelite painter who fitted this shows vision of a socialistfeminist critique of the Victorian social order that artist was William Morris not Rossetti Morris actually was a socialist But while he was trying to design Utopia Rossetti was having an affair with and painting his wife Jane And while the morally fervent John Ruskin was praising and buying not only his art but that of his lover and eventual wife Elizabeth Siddal Rossetti was betraying Siddal with Cornforth In its desperation to see the Rossettis as highminded and progressive this exhibition makes a startling factual error A wall text explaining Rossettis 1859 painting Bocca Baciata tells us it illustrates The Decameron a sensual medieval Italian poem by Giovanni Boccaccio The same claim is in the catalogue But there is no medieval poem called The Decameron It is the founding masterpiece of Italian prose a collection of ribald stories thats an ancestor of the modern novel Rossetti in fact is illustrating the seventh tale on the second day of The Decameron in which an eastern princess on her way to marry the Prince of Algarve is shipwrecked before being pursued and in effect raped by a series of men So this painting is very far from the romantic radicalism this exhibition claims for him In portraying his lover Fanny Cornforth as Boccaccios princess he seems rather to be making a dirty joke or sexual boast What a laugh DG Rossetti was no radical pinup but at least he supported Siddal to become an artist Her paintings like his depict Arthurian romances with brightly hued passion But their combination of selftaught naive drawing with preRaphaelite fantasy is often clumsy and inert Then again thats also true of the more technically refined works of the male preRaphaelites skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Art Weekly Free weekly

even though its owned by Tate probably because it wants to get away from the myth of Siddal She was a real person  but she quickly became a fantasy figure for Rossetti who cherished a lock of her hair  exhibited here  and later got his friends to open her grave in Highgate Cemetery London Christina had her brothers number Her poem In an Artists Studio printed on a wall here evokes a mysterious model whose face looks out from all his canvases This omnipresent nameless girl haunts the artists work He feeds upon her face by day and night Its the preRaphaelite muse a myth this show signally

where we met Kieran and many others desperate to rent we were told that the average house price in the UK is now nine times the average wage A ratio not seen since 1876 said the presenter Rima Ahmed from BBC Radio Leeds Other facts 500000 homes have been taken out of the English private market since 2018 40 local authorities didnt buy or acquire any social housing between 2016 and 2021 on average there are 13 households applying for each new rental Then in All Work and No Homes Pennie Stuart talked to people in Ullapool in the Highlands where there are lots of jobs but no homes for those who want to fill them There are a few available but they are massively expensive local house prices are 130 of the Scottish average wages 87 of the Scottish average This is an easy gig for Ross and an

Vienna her home since leaving London When it comes to housing this is another universe she says In what way Well after the first world war Vienna decided to take housing by the scruff of the neck and now it has various city laws that mean that rents are subsidised and housing developers must designate twothirds of their new buildings as lowincome housing Now 60 of people living in Vienna enjoy subsidised rent Lang also visited Tower Bridge in London to look at houseboat communities and checked out communal housing in various cities all very interesting In Ullapool meanwhile businesses are trying to sort the housing problems themselves setting up flats and glamping pods so that when they advertise a job they can say accommodation is provided In Yorkshire though things arent getting any better Landlords are selling up because of increased mortgage payments a lack of tax relief on mortgage interest and other new rules Poor Alexandra has never missed a rental payment in 14 years but her landlord defaulted on a mortgage payment and the bank is about to repossess her flat She cant find anything to rent privately so shes trying the council I will take the tent I will put the tent in

30m But this is a previously unrecorded antiquity that can never be sold For the large fragment of a Sasanian rock relief  which depicts an imposing male figure carved in the 3rd century AD  has been freshly gouged from a cliff in Iran with an angle grinder It was heading for the black market in Britain when it was seized at Stansted airport Border Force officers became suspicious when they saw its haphazard packaging perhaps intended to suggest that it was a worthless item The antiquity which is over one metre in height was hacked out of living rock or rock that has been carved in situ Dr St John Simpson a senior curator and archaeologist in the British Museums department of the Middle East said We almost never come across a case of something being cut out of the living rock Thats a level of brutalism that surpasses anything Youve even got felttip marks on the back before theyve used an angle grinder to slice diagonally behind it and across the top It was then packed in an incredibly bad manner in a small almost unpadded crate held together with nails If it had been a stateof theart arthandling type crate that would have attracted a different sort of attention because it required all sorts of paperwork He has identified it as a unique rock relief sculpture dating to the period of the Sasanian empire AD224651 It belongs to a period when Iran was the centre of a powerful empire stretching from Syria to the Caucasus and Central Asia and with its capital at Ctesiphon south of presentday Baghdad he said The Sasanians were powerful rivals of Rome and famous today for their fine silverwares and cut glass As it was carved from a calcareous limestone which is found across Iran it is impossible to pinpoint the exact location There are only about 30 known Sasanian rock reliefs in existence mostly dating to the third century Almost all are in a relatively small part of Iran in their ancestral homeland of Fars province Simpson said We suspect it comes from somewhere in the Shiraz area Stylistically it is similar to one known in the region I think it probably is part of a big sequence There might be more bits out there The lack of an inscription makes it impossible to identify the person depicted but his dress and diademed headdress signifies him as a person of high rank His gesture of greeting and submission with a raised bent forefinger is a feature of Sasanian art when figures are in the presence of royalty which suggests that this was part of a larger composition with the king to the right and perhaps other figures behind The relief had broken into two because it had been so badly packed The British Museum has now had it repaired by conservators It looks amazing Simpson said It is stunningly attractive The valuation could be anything really Were talking 20m to 30mplus Theres never been anything like it on the market He said the artefact would be incredibly valuable on the black market Looters were apparently undeterred by severe penalties in place if they are caught he added In Iran they still have the death penalty for trafficking of antiquities People have been tried and executed in Iran within the last couple of decades Were seeing more Iranian material  people are willing and able to break the sanctions despite the death penalty Dr St John Simpson British Museum But in the last few years weve seen more Iranian material So that means that people are willing and able to break the sanctions The case has been investigated by Interpol and the National Crime Agency but no arrests have been made so far although the packaging stipulated the sender recipient and destination  a UK internet auction site which said that it was not expecting it After the object was formally forfeited to the Crown the British Museum received permission from the Iranian government to display it for three months before sending it to the National Museum in Tehran In a statement Seyed Mahdi Hosseini Matin charg daffaires of the Islamic Republic of Iran in London said We sincerely hope that further expansion of cooperation between the British Museum and the Iranian Embassy in London would continue to be effective in fighting against illicit trafficking of cultural properties and protect the cultural heritage of mankind,entertainment

author Deborah Levy began to sit for her portrait The starting point was a selfie  eyes penetrating lips sensuous head topped by a tower of chestnut hair The artist her friend Paul HeberPercy used Photoshop then a pencil and tracing paper to reverse and multiply the image of her face until he had a drawing neatly laid out on a grid that satisfied him Then it was time to paint He liked to work in the mornings in hourlong bursts in his tiny attic studio When Levy came for sittings hed bring the painting down to the dining room and the two of them would drink tea or wine and talk Not that these were sittings in the traditional sense but times I could observe her without feeling selfconscious he said Sometimes theyd discuss Levys new novel August Blue which she was finishing but mostly it was everyday things  friends the news exchanging recipes how to unblock a sink said Levy But HeberPercy told me nothing about these conversations was really everyday She is the sort of person who makes the mundane remarkable Even going down to the bakery with her to get a baguette becomes a slightly magical thing her friend the novelist Tash Aw told me When her friends talk about her they say things like this she is an event she is a personage she is a whole world People often remember the first time they met her For Kate Bland an audio producer it was at a party at a Shoreditch warehouse Levy was sitting on a high windowsill Bland was leaning on it The authors rich slightly breathy voice was coming over Blands shoulder Talk unwound in a sequence of dazzling vignettes It seemed that there was a necessary theatricality we had to hoist ourselves out of the ordinariness of chat and have a conversation that was going to be memorable she recalled I was quite thrilled by it At the time of that party in 2008 Levy was 49 Her life had contained one immense dislocation when she was nine her family emigrated from South Africa to the UK after her father had spent three years as a political prisoner After school at a London comprehensive Levy took a theatre degree at the pioneering avantgarde Dartington College of the Arts in Devon and first forged a path as a playwright Her first novel Beautiful Mutants was published in 1989 the year she turned 30 Twenty years on at the time of the Shoreditch party she wasnt famous and hadnt sold more than a modest number of books though she carried herself as if she had She was teaching adapting Colette and Carol Shields for the radio raising two daughters and living with her husband playwright David Gale in a semidetached house off Holloway Road in north London She was working on a novel her first since 1996 Her previous books were out of print Four years later Levys life was transformed Her novel Swimming Home  a sundrenched story about a family holiday on the French Riviera beneath whose glinting surface runs a Freudian riptide of wartime trauma  was shortlisted for the 2012 Booker prize That sent sales flying At the same time her marriage fell apart By the time I went to the Booker dinner in December I knew I would be moving house and I was packing up she told me It was very turbulent and very painful The following year she published Things I Dont Want to Know the first in a trilogy of what she calls living autobiographies to convey their selective fictive nature Over the next few years she alternated two more novels Hot Milk and The Man Who Saw Everything with two more volumes of living autobiography which spoke of how after her marriage ended she recomposed a life for herself and her daughters in her 50s outside the old patriarchal structures All of these books she told me flew out of her like a cork coming out of a bottle Levys novels are popular and critically acclaimed But it is with the living autobiographies that her reputation has transcended the literary At events readers tell Levy that her books make them feel less lonely or ask her what to do about a life crisis One cant quite imagine readers doing this with say Rachel Cusk who also anatomises female experience but in a somewhat chillier style At one of Levys online readings during the Covid pandemic an audience member posted in the chat Im 41 with two kids and sometimes I dont feel Im at home at all  Did it work for you coming out of an unhappy marriage Levy answered It did work for me You have to make another sort of life and gather your friends and supporters to your table  which is pretty much the story of the second and third of her living autobiographies The Cost of Living and Real Estate Levy left in 2012 with fellow Man Booker shortlisted authors Tan Twan Eng Hilary Mantel Will Self Alison Moore and Jeet Thayil Photograph Luke MacGregorReuters Levys writing has a very particular quality it seems to infiltrate the mind You absorb her way of seeing and start to perceive the world in Levyish ways In her stories seemingly trivial moments take on political force an encounter with a hairdresser in The Cost of Living becomes a story about the camaraderie of women and what they reveal to each other a scene about sharing a table on the Eurostar becomes about how men literally and figuratively fail to make space for younger women In the new novel August Blue the narrator having been insulted by a young man in a cafe tells us I think he was expecting me to respond to reply in some way but I didnt care about him or his problems Ive used that in my own life more than once since first reading it The books become almost a guide to life said Gaby Wood director of the Booker Foundation She trains you to become your best self Part of the appeal of Levys writing is that it is shot through with unpatronising sympathy towards younger women  both the hesitant tough young female characters who populate her novels and those who appear in her living autobiographies often negotiating sticky situations with older entitled men In Real Estate there is a passage in which she describes her joy in cooking for her daughters friends I liked their appetite  yes for the dish prepared but for life itself I wanted them to find strength for all they had to do in the world and for all the world would throw at them She is not just talking about her daughters friends Levy is also in the business of feeding and strengthening her readers And they feel it The plays and the novels Levy wrote in her 20s and 30s are collagelike gravelly spiky and dense marinated in the eastern European avantgarde influences she absorbed at college She had a talent for epigrammatic slightly surreal sentences I once heard a man howl just like a wolf except he was standing in a phone box in Streatham says a character in her first novel But the work had not yet acquired the razoredaway spare quality that has given the later work such airiness such ripple and flow nor was there the emotional force with which readers identify so strongly It was in the late 2000s that she forged the style that transformed her reputation She was working at the Royal College of Art at the time Two days a week shed take the tube from the fumes of Holloway Road to green South Kensington She was a tutor in the animation department helping students learn to write and construct narrative It was a potent time she told me when we met in September Her colleagues at the Royal College of Art were inspiring so were her students At nights while her young daughters slept she was writing Swimming Home I was somehow living closer to my own emotions and understood that I might be able to put them to work in my book She had always felt that emotion was frowned upon by her avantgarde art family but from Swimming Home onwards I decided to totally upend that Charging the story with feeling changed her writing  and her relationship with readers I knew I was on to something and it rocked me she told me There were times when Id stop writing and Id come down to cook my daughters spaghetti in the evening There was a sort of cool place under the steps and I was so on fire I would just stand there and cool down What Levy found in her writing was a way of giving her story a shimmering attractive surface while allowing her preoccupations with literary theory myth and psychoanalysis to occupy its murkier depths The novel can be taken as a kind of holiday novel gone wrong she said  and it has been slipped into many a suitcase as a beach or poolside read Im happy if the surface is read she told me Because everything else is there to be found And Im working hard for my readers to find it But I dont look down on readers who dont I think Something will come through The something might include the Freudian desire and deathwish that suffuses the novel its peculiar linked imagery of sugar mice and rats above all the immense treacherous undertow of history  of the Holocaust of 20thcentury suffering and wars  that Levy sketches into the story with almost imperceptible strokes But Swimming Home was rejected by every major publisher it was sent to Levy in all her certainty that it was good was devastated The years following the financial crisis of 2008 were inhospitable to a midlist novelist who hadnt been in print for a while The publishing industry was in trouble the powerful new wave of feminism of the 2010s was a whisper rather than a roar and the kind of spare experimental books by women that would come to define recent literary trends such as Cusks autofictional Outline trilogy or Annie Ernauxs intimate unfurling of memory or Elena Ferrantes revelatory novels on female friendship had yet to appear in Britain At the time she said your book was either going to sell or it wasnt going to sell and when they said it was too literary they meant it wasnt going to sell Then in summer 2009 something changed A friend of Levys the late Jules Wright who ran an arts centre in east London read the manuscript She was organising a show on photographer Dean Rogers who documented the sites of car crashes that had killed cultural heroes  the spot for example where Marc Bolan died Swimming Home begins with a scene in which Kitty Finch a young woman with a death wish perilously drives an older poet with whom she believes she has a telepathic connection along a winding mountain road Wright decided to have the first two pages of the book printed large and installed at the beginning of the exhibition Not long after the opening though she called Levy and bluntly announced she was removing them It was a disaster she said  people were clogging the entrance as they stopped to read the text It was Levy told me the first spark that those two pages of this muchdeclined book were gathering a crowd around them Eventually the novel did find its publisher a tiny new press called And Other Stories The literary translator Sophie Lewis was editor there Levys pitch remarkably given all the rejections was supremely confident Deborah told me This is the tightest book Ive ever written and its going to be a bestseller Lewis remembered In autumn 2011 Levys friend Charlotte Schepke who runs Large Glass gallery in London hosted the launch party They decided to project The Swimmer the 1968 Burt Lancaster film on to the wall On the night to Schepkes immense surprise you couldnt stand  the place was absolutely packed It was rammed Her interesting new friend who had written witty labels for the opening show at her small gallery earlier that year was suddenly making waves It was almost said Schepke as if shed done this grand thing of claiming to be an author  and then suddenly she really was an author Burt Lancaster and Janet Landgard in The Swimmer 1968 Photograph MoviestoreRexShutterstock In her living autobiographies Levy frequently refers to her rented shed a writing space in a friends garden on whose roof the apples used to fall in autumn with a dull thunk These days as she moves deeper into her 60s the shed has been replaced by an attic in Paris a few blocks behind the bookshop Shakespeare  Company near the Seine When I visited her there on a limpid blue February day she had pinned a branch of yellow mimosa to her front door Its flowering marked she said the end of gloomy ratgrey January The studio was as near to the platonic ideal of a Paris garret as you could imagine reached by a winding stair through a courtyard and with low ceilings and wooden beams Kilim rugs were scattered on the floor and her bed was covered in a fluffy sheepskin throw There was a stash of red wine in the fireplace Everything about the studio radiated her delight in objects and food and pleasure reminding me of how when wed met for lunch at a London pavement cafe the previous July despite the overwhelming heat shed ordered a vermouth on ice followed by a pizza topped off by a strong coffee and a rollup If you met the author and saw the studio before you read the work you might expect something more excessive and elaborate than the strippeddown translucent prose she produces She poured coffee from a moka pot and passed me a dish heaped with croissants from her local boulangerie La Maison DIsabelle pastries from the same shop turn up in the new novel Objects from her real world often slip into her fiction There was a biography of Isadora Duncan faceout on a shelf perhaps the same book about the dancer she has her character Elsa read in August Blue On a table stood a bowl of pearl necklaces and at her throat were pearls  like the pearl necklace she has her beautiful careless character Saul wear in her novel The Man Who Saw Everything Things in her stories often hold the kind of powerful significance that Freud attaches to artefacts in dreams  such as the pool in Swimming Home which at its most basic Levy pointed out is a rectangular hole in the ground and thus also metaphorically a grave She loves the surrealists The turning point of Hot Milk is the moment when her narrator Sofia discovers boldness through making bloody handprints on the kitchen wall of a man who has been tormenting his dog  a scene borrowed from a story told about the artist Leonora Carrington who letting herself into the apartment of her prospective lover Luis Buuel smeared menstrual blood over his pristine white walls Motifs slip between books too in this she has something in common with a visual artist building a subtly interconnected body of work The title August Blue for example is taken from the colour of the thread that in Hot Milk one character Ingrid uses to embroider Sofias name into a shirt Horses in particular gallop through Levys work  from the tiny horseshaped buttons that in Real Estate she kept from her late stepmothers button box to the moment Ingrid appears in the desert landscape on horseback like a bellicose goddess in the mythinfused Hot Milk The whole of August Blue hangs on striking images of horses it begins with her character the pianist Elsa watching jealously as a woman she thinks might be her doppelganger buys a pair of mechanical dancing horses in an Athens flea market Levy laughed when I asked her about her equine enthusiasms Thats a case for Dr Freud she said She ponders in Real Estate what it is to be a woman on your high horse Sometimes she writes you might find yourself incapable of controlling your high horse at other times people are all too eager to to pull you off it She imagines a friend riding her high horse down the North Circular to repair her smashed screen at Mr Cellfone When I think of Levys horses I also think of her adoration of her small fleet of ebikes now famous from her living autobiographies which she stables by her London flat and lends to friends when they visit she bought her first when she moved out of her marriage and into her new life When they start up with a little equine surge of power she told me its hard not to whoop every time When Levy was a small child in South Africa and her father Norman Levy was imprisoned for his antiapartheid activism she started to speak so quietly that her voice became barely audible What saved her from this state of virtual silence was her imagination the dawning understanding that she could write other realities It was a question Levy told me of finding avatars The avatar she created for her nineyearold self was a cat with wondrous powers of flight  perhaps unconsciously imagining freedom for her father as well as liberation for herself In Real Estate The Flying Cat is the name she gives to the ferry that brings her daughters to her for a holiday on a Greek island The characters in her fiction are still her avatars Im in every one of them she said including the cats and including the horses For a long time in adulthood she resisted writing or even talking about South Africa The difficulties of her family felt irrelevant she told me when set against the struggles of black South Africans But since she had decided to base the structure of Things I Dont Want to Know on George Orwells headings in his essay Why I Write  one of which is historical impulse  she found herself obliged to tackle those repressed memories Using a childs eye view she said I tried to convey without using the old language of the bloodstained regime of apartheid what its like to be told that youre supposed to respect adults while there are white adults who are clearly doing very cruel things to children of colour my age Her mother Philippa through her husbands imprisonment coped alone earning a living through a succession of secretarial jobs Levy remembers her as capable and glamorous I loved the way she cooked with her cigarette holder and the way that shed dance a bit to the record shed put on when she came back from work When Levys father was released in 1968 he was banned from working and the family  Levy has an elder halfbrother from her mothers first marriage as well as a younger brother and sister  had little option but to emigrate Her father found work lecturing at Middlesex University among other places Money was tight Her parents marriage ended in 1974 After the blue sky and the bonewhite grass of the garden in Johannesburg arriving in London felt as if someone had pulled the plug out But despite Englands greyness she loved it She made for the first time proper friends I dont have that narrative of exile she told me of wanting to return to the place that you left She adored the way people spoke and she still delights in English turns of phrase Hello pet hello lamb hello duck As for her accent I had to lose it very quickly in the playground not to be beaten up She often plucks her characters out of their familiar environments partly in order to see their psychological foibles magnified on foreign shores She herself likes very much to be in a hot country in southern Spain or a Greek island swimming in the sea Sometimes these characters like her have been swept on the tides of 20thcentury history  like the English poet Joe in Swimming Home who is really Jozef smuggled out of d in 1943 or Lapinski in Beautiful Mutants whose mother was the iceskating champion of Moscow Levy told me of an interview in the news that moved her recently it was with a Ukrainian woman from Kherson who had been lying in bed thinking when she was blown into her kitchen by a Russian shell Those were her words I was lying in bed thinking said Levy I do not take a place of calm a place that is agreeable to think in for granted Levys senses are finely tuned to the fragility of things Works by Joseph Beuys at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Pantin France in 2012 Photograph Bertrand Rindoff PetroffGetty Images After her Alevels in the summer of 1978 she would walk past the Gate cinema in Notting Hill timidly noting the thrilling eccentrically dressed people who hung out there One day she saw an ad in the Evening Standard for frontofhouse staff For the interview she put on a pair of big gold platform wedges as she left the house her mother yelled Youll never get a job dressed like that Those gold wedges are the ancestors of the shoes that have carried her female characters on to victory or else to triumphant defeat the silver gladiator sandals that Ingrid like the goddess Athena straps high up her calves in Hot Milk the sagegreen Parisian tap shoes that get her into a scrape in Real Estate the brothel creepers that to her younger self marked me out for a meaningful life and the scuffed brown leather shoes with high snakeskin heels that we meet on page three of August Blue She got the job at the Gate Her new colleagues were either at drama school or off to university and all way cooler than me I was a nerdy writer  of poetry at the time  with a great love of Bowie The cinema was screening Derek Jarmans film Jubilee and he would come in and he was curious and charismatic and friendly and cultured and he didnt feel above talking to this 18yearold making the popcorn tearing the tickets and scooping the ice cream It was Jarman who told her she should apply not to university but to Dartington where shed learn about improvisation and dance and avantgarde theatre and art It was at this time not having the kind of parents who dragged her round galleries at weekends that she encountered contemporary art for the first time It was an exhibition of the work of Joseph Beuys She remembers she told me a grand piano muffled and covered with cloth marked with a cross other objects made of gold leaf dried plants tacked to the wall things scribbled in pencil I remember almost not being able to breathe And there was this voice inside my head saying This is it This is it And I had no idea what it was The Cost of Living opens with the narrator witnessing an encounter between a young woman and an older man in a bar in Colombia The man whom Levy calls the Big Silver invites the young woman to his table After she tells him a strange story about a perilous diving expedition he remarks that she talks a lot and carelessly knocks her book off the table Levy writes It had not occurred to him that she might not consider herself to be the minor character and him the major character It is a very Levyish story in its wry observation of dynamics between men and women and with its implicit call to arms to women who have as the critic Dwight Garner has put it come to sense theyre not locked into their lives and stories Levy herself is without doubt a major character  and is intent on expanding the role She has an immense appetite for experiencing the strange dimensions of living and the absolutely practical dimensions she told me We were sitting at the time outside a cafe near the Panthon in Paris after a good lunch and Levy was smoking a rollup Im not endlessly open to experience I am easily bored and impatient I want to keep things moving keep thought moving I want to make something new of the old story How do you make the novel as complicated as life as interesting as life Thats what I want to do She has many plans She wants to adapt her two most recent novels for the screen Swimming Home and Hot Milk are in other scriptwriters hands She knows exactly she told me how the opening scene of August Blue will go and she has the perfect idea of how to tackle the temporal complexities of The Man Who Saw Everything which slips through its main characters fractured consciousness between the Berlin of 1988 and the London of 2016 In The Cost of Living Levy fantasises about living in California and writing scripts by her pool When I teased her lightly about the unlikelihood of this she said You never know I just might be there in my swimming costume at 80 writing films Id have a river now  with a little rowing boat tied to the jetty and Id smoke drink coffee and write my scripts I think probably in France In the meantime now that her daughters are in their 20s she comes from her London flat to work in her Paris studio for weeks at a time She is taking French lessons though presently her literary enthusiasms outstrip her linguistic ability I say Shall we translate this poem of Apollinaire together and my teacher says I think today Deborah we will try to master tre and avoir Her most natural creative affinities are in fact French  Godard Duras  rather than British To her evident delight Levy has won one of Frances most important literary awards the Prix Femina tranger She has not yet won a major prize in Britain despite multiple shortlistings perhaps because British prizes tend to favour large selfsufficient discrete slabs of fiction She begins her days early with a walk by the Seine After work there might be an exhibition or dinner  which she might depart more than one friend told me with sudden decision announcing that she is back off to work She looked abashed when I mentioned this habit worried she might appear rude to her friends Im immensely sociable and then I really need to be on my own I do like to write after a dinner party she said She herself loves to cook  delicious mountains of cream and garlic and the kitchen is like a bomb site Charlotte Schepke told me but its like being in the finest restaurant Her presence makes it an occasion At the moment in a sharp change of gear she is researching a biography of the young Gertrude Stein to be titled Mama of Dada She is concentrating on the writers early training under psychologist William James brother of the novelist Henry Levy wants to think about how this academically brilliant American  whod be late for her medical lectures because her bustled skirts were weighted down by horsehairstuffed hems  moved to Paris ditched the corset and became the pioneering modernist who dressed in monklike robes and filled her house with Picassos A presence with many selves  Paul HeberPercys portrait of Deborah Levy Photograph Sarah LeeThe Guardian Its a characteristic way for Levy to build character But while the books are rooted in the physical they also make room for the uncanny and the unexplained for the sudden intrusion into a persons consciousness of unwelcome memories or dark imaginings It would be very sad to have all the possibilities of the novel this hotair balloon but to say I only write social realism and the hotair balloon must never leave the ground she told me Thats not how peoples minds work people have very strange dreams and thoughts and daydreams and associations She is she said very careful not to let her hotair balloon float away into the clouds of fantasmagoria It is all in the balance and control What also earths Levys work is her wit She is so amused diverted and delighted by life said the actor Tilda Swinton who is a fan Her jokes often wryly commenting on her own failings make for a kind of intimacy even complicity  the kind of complicity that many of us can only relate to the dry land of childhood companionship said Swinton Levys women especially the I of the living autobiographies fail as well as succeed they have good days and bad They are neither feisty and gutsy  those tiresome cliches  nor are they selfsaboteurs who put themselves down to ingratiate themselves with the reader They are both real and offer an example of how to live well When Levy was finding a way to write her living autobiographies she searched for a voice that was immensely powerful immensely vulnerable immensely eloquent and totally inarticulate Because thats all of us In March I went back to Paul HeberPercys house to see her portrait finished It renders Levys face in triplicate as if seen through a kaleidoscope and her hair piled on her head soars upwards like Medusas snaky locks dissolving into abstract Rorschachlike patterns and repetitions It gave the impression of a presence with many selves in constant movement of thought In the portrait Levy has five large wideopen scrutinising eyes but one of her tripled faces disappears into the world outside the frame and the sixth eye is unseen August Blue will be published by Hamish Hamilton on 4 May and is available at

Red Sea What happened next is uncertain The most boring legend has Avery  AKA Henry Every or Long Ben  buried in a paupers grave in Barnstaple Devon Another recently endorsed in the book Pirate Enlightenment by the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber posits that Avery sailed for Madagascar where he established a pirate republic with his henchmen called Libertalia a protocommunist utopia where all goods were held common The National Maritime Museum Cornwall in Falmouth offers another account in its fascinating new exhibition Pirates After paying off his likeminded hearties in Mughal bling Avery sailed for home But nearing Cornwall he and his pirate booty were shipwrecked and lie deep in Davy Joness locker In the 1970s female pirates were seized on by feminists Now theyve become part of a different LGBTI discourse Or do they Stuart Slade museum deputy director wants to claim the king of pirates and the legend of the missing treasure for Cornwall He cites a tantalising 19thcentury document in Cornwalls Record Office in Redruth that purports to reveal the treasures location It says About three miles to the east of the Lizard  under three grey stones or rocks in a cove to the south west It is near where the corner of the high promontory just out into the sea He said the spring tides now cover the place One chest the document adds contains rubies sapphires emeralds topazes and diamonds another contains more than 150 gold ingots a third 3000 pieces of eight Girl power  an engraving of pirate Mary Read by A Catel Photograph National Maritime Museum Greenwich Although the area has been thoroughly searched says a caption in the exhibition nothing has been found Now is the time to fire up your metal detector  though if the treasure is ever discovered you would think the Indian government has first dibs Avery was the most successful of those men and women who thrived in the socalled golden age of piracy between 1650 and 1730 in the Atlantic and Indian oceans The exhibition aims to explore why pirates endure in the popular imagination It cant just be because of Johnny Depps appropriation of Keith Richards mockney drawl in the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise Slade says other dressy antinomian figures have their moments  who doesnt like a dandy highwayman  but that lawless swashbucklers on the high seas have captivated us ever since 1881 when Robert Louis Stevenson wrote the first half of Treasure Island But there is a chasm deeper than the Mariana Trench between piratical reality and fiction The gap between the beruffed dandies and fragile masculinities depicted in Taika Waititis recent sitcom Our Flag Means Death and Somali pirates plying the same waters as Avery did centuries earlier could not be more stark This point is made clear by a glass case containing an oldschool cutlass of the kind that captains Blood Hook and Blackbeard waved in anger alongside a replica AK47 the weapon of choice for todays real pirates Slade suggests that we can project our fantasies on to golden age pirates In the first half of the 20th century for instance pirate movies depicted white men think Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Sr on the high seas swinging in on a yardarm with a cutlass in their teeth to seize not only pirate booty but decorous damsels who from 2023s perspective seem victims of coercion This exhibition is keen to problematise such white supremacist masculine narratives by showing us queer pirates pirates of colour and female pirates Artwork commissioned for the show from Queer Kernow comes with this caption Pirates existed in the shadows in the margins of society  overthrowing societal conventions and creating their own counterculture Such figures as Anne Bonny Mary Read and John Calico Jack Rackham have as the note puts it queer resonances We project on this piratical other in lieu of historical fact our everchanging fantasies In the 1970s women pirates were seized on by feminists Now theyve become part of a different LGBTI discourse says Slade We project our fantasies on to them  poster for the 1926 film The Black Pirate Photograph Distributed by United Artists An 1852 engraving of Mary Read by A Catel for the book Histoire des Pirates depicts a bloodied tar lying vanquished on a beach The cutlasswielding pirate standing over him pulls back her top to reveal her breasts The mans shocked and rueful expression to me at least says Bad enough to be beaten but beaten by a girl Few pirates we learn were persons of colour  but reportedly six out of 10 of Edward Blackbeard Teachs crew were black Among them was Black Caesar posited here to have been west African and an enslaved person who escaped the wreckage of a slave ship during the Atlantic crossing and was later hanged in Williamsburg New York Many pirates realised that there was money to be made from African bodies It is tempting to imagine that freedomloving pirates might release enslaved people says the caption But usually they were treated just as inhumanely by the pirates and sold for profit or in some cases thrown overboard to drown Not surprisingly pirate legends are not especially alluring in todays Caribbean where many peoples ancestors were enslaved Alexis McDavid of the National Museum Jamaica says Today its seen as being very Eurocentric That said when the then Jamaican capital of Port Royal was partially destroyed by a 75magnitude earthquake in 1692 it was regarded as Gods wrath over this modern Sodom in which sex work and piracy thrived And Jamaica hasnt erased its piratical past today the sunken pirate city is a national heritage site open for diving excursions and hailed by some as an underwater Pompeii Short brutal lives  Blackbeards head on the bowsprit an illustration from The Pirates Own Book by Charles Ellms 1844 Photograph  National Maritime Museum Greenwich London The romantic idea of pirates living free and democratically outside straight society nonetheless persists Graeber suggested The toothless or peglegged buccaneer hoisting a flag of defiance against the world  is perhaps as much a figure of the Enlightenment as Adam Smith or Voltaire but he also represents a profoundly proletarian liberation necessarily violent and ephemeral Ephemeral is right Slade estimates that pirates lasted on average two years at their illegal trade before being hanged drowned or sensibly retiring In some iterations the Jolly Roger flag includes not just skull and crossbones but an hourglass to make the point that the life of the pirate was nasty brutish and  even if an adrenalinefuelled rollercoaster  short Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts AKA Black Bart or in Welsh Barti Ddu died aged 39 after seizing 400 prizes possibly a pirate world record Legend has it that Teach wove hemp into his beard and set it alight before battle in order to intimidate his enemies Fear as much as cutlasses and gunpowder was a leading weapon What apart from unimaginable riches and the promise of intercontinental legovers attracted people to become pirates It wasnt as hierarchical as the Royal Navy says Slade Captains were elected And they lived according to a code The exhibition sets out the code that prevailed on Black Barts ship According to article one Every man has a vote in affairs of moment has equal title to the fresh provisions or strong liquors at any time seized and may use them at pleasure Bloody battles  Sea of Thieves the video game recreated at the show Photograph  Microsoft Exhibits include a haul of pieces of eight loaned from the British Museum and an immersive installation replicating the video game Sea of Thieves Perhaps the best exhibits in the show though are the mannequins dressed in replicas of the high street knockoffs of the pirate outfit Vivienne Westwood designed in 1981 If the gift shop doesnt include replicas of those replicas Ill be astounded If the pirates emerge from this show as questionable characters then its real hero is Stevenson whose Treasure Island created many of the enduring emblems of the pirate genre the onelegged rogue the cabin boy hiding in an apple barrel the map to the buried treasure marked by an X Former poet laureate Andrew Motion who has written two sequels to Treasure Island says of Stevenson He never wrote a bad line King of pirates  Henry Avery in Captain Charles Johnsons book A General History of the Pyrates Photograph  National Maritime Museum Greenwich London And yet Stevenson is neglected he rarely figures on school recommended reading lists Treasure Island is best known through words that are not Stevensons own  from illustrated abridgements and more than 50 film and TV adaptations including Muppet Treasure Island and one featuring Mr Magoo The show ends with a real gibbet loaned by Rye Castle Museum The golden age of piracy came to a bloody end in the 1730s as governments decided pirates were too much of a liability to trade and stamped them out We went back and forth on whether to include the gibbet says Slade But we decided that the brutal truth needs to be shown Captain Kidd was among the pirates to be executed He was hanged twice at Execution Dock in Wapping London The rope broke on the first attempt and despite some people in the crowd shouting it was a sign from God that he should be released minutes later he was hanged again His body was displayed on a gibbet at Tilbury Point over the River Thames  a warning to future pirates Avery probably eluded the noose though where he met his end and what happened to his treasure remains uncertain The likelihood is that there be treasure in these Cornish parts Jim lad Possibly,entertainment

OFarrell spun a fable about the route of a plague to England in the summer of 1596 It started with a monkey three fleas and a cabin boy in the port of Alexandria and ended up making its way to Worcestershire in the wadding of a box of beads where it killed Hamnet the 11yearold son of a Latin teacher turned playwright A few years later William Shakespeare would premiere one of the worlds greatest tragedies Hamlet Shakespeare is known to have been touring a play in Kent at the time of his sons death Its not even known if he made it back to the funeral I hope he did says OFarrell who was so haunted by the story that she held off writing about it until her own son was safely past the age of 11 like Shakespeare she has a son and two daughters In her bestselling novel Hamnet she allowed the grieving father to be with his family at the graveside I think him arriving in my novel was a wishfulfilment for him The novel was published in spring 2020 just as the world was shutting down and its evocation of that earlier pestilence seemed part of its uncanny genius It went on to sell 15m copies worldwide and win the Womens prize for fiction Three years later it is on the brink of a new life in the town in which Hamnet died where a stage adaptation will reopen the Royal Shakespeare Companys Swan theatre after a threeyear closure before moving on to the West End in London The plague interlude is obviously no longer necessary says OFarrell because weve been there right Weve been to Alexandria and Venice in our heads as we sat isolated in our homes watching the news You no longer need to explain what a pestilence is Its not wonderful Its dark But weve had this collective experience To look at the family behind the man who made all this work has been an extraordinary thing Lolita Chakrabarti Hamnet tells the story of 18 years of Shakespeares life from the point of view of his wife who has traditionally been known as poor neglected Anne Hathaway the illiterate countrywoman who was left behind with their three children when her husband set off for the bright lights of London and was only bequeathed his secondbest bed Parish records revealed she was in fact christened Agnes by her sheepfarmer father OFarrell portrays her as a healer and herbalist pointing out that far from being this embittered wife abandoned in StratforduponAvon Agnes went on to invest her husbands earnings in her own malting business as well as running the big house he bought in 1597 for the princely sum of 60 in silver It was there that he chose to retire surrounded by his family and where he died at the age of 52 The woman who has been charged with transporting the story from page to stage is Lolita Chakrabarti an actor and playwright whose previous successes include adapting the multiawardwinning Life of Pi which has just opened on Broadway She had not read Hamnet before agreeing to take on the job Ive lived in Shakespeare Ive played in it and watched it she says It was Antony Shers RSC performance in Richard III that switched the lights on for her as a 15yearold surgeons daughter on a school outing from Birmingham But to look at the family behind the man who made this work has been an extraordinary thing And of course we never think of the woman behind the man do we But now that Ive read Maggies novel and been immersed in it the influence of Agnes and of their family just seems such an obvious thing Were talking over video call in a break from rehearsals Chakrabarti is downing a cup of soup in Stratford and OFarrell is clutching a mug of tea in her Edinburgh home Most of their communication was over email We did go back and forth quite a lot says OFarrell laughing as she recalls one particular email My husband asked how long it was and I realised it was 5000 words He said Jesus I feel sorry for Lolita I think I got quite carried away but very nicely she didnt say Why are you sending a 5000word essay about 16thcentury guild membership Lolita Chakrabarti in Shakespeares old schoolroom in StratforduponAvon Photograph Antonio OlmosThe Observer Actually says Chakrabarti I thought they were really good notes Sometimes it was about historical accuracy and sometimes because I had plucked something off Google to be the solution for the plague and Maggie very rightly said No its not that herb  its this one One of the challenges was to distil 18 years of interrupted life into a twohour play Writing chronologically complex plots is something that really appeals to me You can get away with flashbacks and flashforwards on the page but on stage its a lot more difficult so I had a bit of sympathy for Lolita says OFarrell Yeah there were actually lots of challenges says Chakrabarti Its about nature which is beautiful on film but how do you do that on stage And then there is the fact that a lot of it feels quite internal Agness intelligence unfolds in premonitions psychic instincts I dont know what it is but that kind of spiritual side of things Then there was the challenge of finding theatrical language for it Ive tried to take what Maggie intended and distil it into theatrical Tudor but current so that it places them in their time but were not too distanced from them as people says Chakrabarti Ive put in some vernacular colour that Ive invented to suggest it is in Warwickshire of that time I was really conscious that up until quite recently Shakespeare had become quite a middleclass thing when in Tudor times there were different accents from all around the country and all the actors were from everywhere I really didnt want this version to be RP received pronunciation Ive always felt that the best book youre going to write is the one you cant not write Maggie OFarrell The snobbishness of Shakespeare studies turned out to be a shared concern For OFarrell this meant rescuing both Agnes and to a certain extent Shakespeare himself from the class prejudice that had labelled the couple this literary genius saddled with an illiterate wife Why is there so much debate as to whether this provincial figure could have been responsible for some of the greatest plays in the English language she asks If you think about Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe they were both classically educated whereas Shakespeare probably left grammar school around the age of 15 Theres a feeling that therefore he couldnt have done it But just because you leave school doesnt mean you stop learning As for Agnes At that time of course there wasnt the education or the opportunities for her But it doesnt mean to say there werent different forms of intelligence and education Illiteracy doesnt equal stupidity or lack of intelligence you know Its such a narrow way to regard them As a novelist Im asking a reader to follow me through a forest a bit like Hansel and Gretel Maggie OFarrell Photograph David LevensonGetty Images The central question of Hamnet is the role that Agnes played in her husbands creative life I think any exclusion may only have extended to the geographical in that his work took place in London and she lived in the family home in Stratford Ive always been certain that you can find submerged traces of her everywhere in his work says OFarrell who tracked Agness influence through the recurrent motifs of herbs and birds in Shakespeares plays creating her own Elizabethan herb garden as part of her research into Agness medicinal wisdom The question of what constitutes a creative partnership is one that plays to the personal experience of both women OFarrell is married to a fellow novelist William Sutcliffe I wouldnt say we collaborate exactly but he is always my first reader and hes a very incisive one He doesnt pull his punches and isnt afraid to tell me when something isnt working  and while that is sometimes hard to hear its precisely what I need she says Chakrabarti is married to the actor Adrian Lester whom she first met aged 14 at Birminghams Midlands Arts Centre and who turned out to live in the same street They became a couple as drama students at Londons Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Rada and married in 1997 Because we are in the same business I understand the complete immersion you need in order to make a new role Of course life continues and chores need to be done but I am always surprised when I see the show on screen or on stage at what he has created It doesnt always fit with the demands of life but I know that focus is necessary she says Chakrabarti with the puppet of Richard Parker the tiger from her stage adaptation of Life of Pi at the 2022 Olivier awards The tigers seven puppeteers collectively won best actor in a supporting role Photograph David LeveneThe Guardian In 2020 the couple published a dizzying joint diary of a 16month period of their working lives when he was juggling work on the miniseries The Rook with trying to get his own film and theatre projects off the ground and she was combining acting work with drafting and redrafting her adaptation of Life of Pi Half of my creative life is always taken over by my life as a mother wrote Chakrabarti My kids need structure and order their daughters are now 18 and 20 years old which seem in direct opposition to a freelance life sometimes it seems like an impossible task She was simultaneously working on a multidisciplinary adaptation of Italo Calvinos fantastical travelogue Invisible Cities premiered at the Manchester international festival in 2019 and a yettobereleased film version of her own hit play Red Velvet with Lester reprising the role of the African American actor Ira Aldridge who caused a storm in 1833 when he took over from Edmund Kean in a West End production of Othello She recalled redrafting the screenplay with notes Lester had given her He always looks at my writing with an actors eye but also a directors one she wrote Its very useful because I come from an emotional logic rather than a visual one With so many competing demands on her time how does she primarily see herself Ive always said Im an actor first and then a writer but this last year because I havent managed to fit in much acting Ive been sort of begrudgingly saying Im a writer and an actor because the writing has come to me more easily OFarrell accepting the Womens prize for fiction 2020 for Hamnet Photograph David M BenettDave BenettGetty Images for The Green Room Agency This is partly the timeold issue of age When she was in her 20s an older actor warned her that 3050 was very hard for women in the theatre That was like half of my life ahead of me And she was right actually I think things have changed in the past four or five years But before that people didnt really know what to do with women and then people of colour that was a whole other thing Six years ago she played her first Shakespearean mother  Gertrude  to Tom Hiddlestons Hamlet in a production that was one of 2017s hottest tickets staged by Kenneth Branagh to raise money for their alma mater Rada Shes 53 now I feel really lucky Im getting to tell some stories that I want to tell And I get to put women on stage I think Im secretly writing for my 30 to 50yearold self she says These are not career anxieties that afflict a novelist and memoirist such as OFarrell whose reputation has been growing with every novel You know its funny people often ask you about your career And I always think what career she says I think if you are attracted to being a writer youre not the kind of person who thinks that you have a career at all Ive always felt that the best book youre going to write is the one you cant not write  the one thats the one thats calling to you and tugging at your sleeve most insistently Though Hamnet is now also being made into a film  details of which she is forbidden to reveal  she has never considered diversifying into scriptwriting As a novelist Im asking a reader to follow me through a forest a bit like Hansel and Gretel and I know how to leave a trail of visible breadcrumbs for the novel But I wouldnt know how to do that for an audience I just dont have those muscles Watching rehearsals for the play had given her a new understanding of the significance of the term playwright she adds Its the same root as the word wheelwright you know this old fashioned work of making and creating something There was this room full of people at the top of their game not just actors but lighting and movement and costume specialists What fascinated me is the idea that it was a kind of callandresponse process The play was being wrought right in front of us It gives an insight into what Shakespeare himself did He had an incredible company the Lord Chamberlains Men or the Kings Men and they wrote the plays together Seeing that echoed in what Lolita and Erica Whyman the director and everybody else was doing was very moving As Chakrabarti enters the final frenzy of bringing Agnes to life on stage OFarrell has retreated to her medicinal herb garden In fact I was clearing it out over the weekend and thinking what am I going to grow this year Because obviously its been very much in abeyance over the winter she says All your characters are part of you in a way so is Agnes still with me Definitely And I hope she always will be,entertainment

featuring songs that Nakhane describes as devastating It showcased their operatic vocals on ballads containing intimate storytelling that explored their experience of leaving Christianity behind When Nakhane was 19 they came out as gay but after feeling shame about their sexuality underwent conversion therapy At the time when I went into the church I was strangely enough leaning into my queerness but I had all of this conditioning as a child about how it was a sin and how I was going to go to hell So when someone told me I should go to the church it touched on all those things I was already so scared of I wanted so badly to go to heaven When Nakhane eventually left the church the journey to their true self wasnt as simple as they had imagined I thought it was going to feel so free I felt unhinged I felt like I had nothing holding me because that was the thing that held every facet of my life The question was who are you I had to start almost over from scratch The aftermath of the conversion therapy is something Nakhane is still dealing with today Recently they were watching a TV series about a Christian cult and something clicked they began noticing the similarities between the show and their own experiences My closest friends  I was told over and over again to let go of them in the church Thats what they do right Isolate you from those people so that you only depend on them completely Maybe this was a cult Gender is big wide old and ancient Theres nothing new about it Theres nothing perverse about it Organised religion is no longer of interest to them If your only tool is fear youve lost me but spirituality still is Everyone has a right to God or whatever you want to call it How dare you think that you own God Im sure God is thinking Im so much bigger than this Im not this boring Since those dark times Nakhane is getting closer and closer to their truest self They came out as nonbinary in 2021 an experience they say felt like unlocking a door Gender is big wide old and ancient Theres nothing new about it Theres nothing perverse about it In addition to music they have also tried their hand at other art forms in 2015 they released Piggy Boys Blues a novel about a Xhosa the second largest cultural group in South Africa royal family and in 2017 starred in John Trengoves The Wound Despite favourable reviews the film received a backlash from those back home in South Africa and in the Xhosa community for interlacing ulwaluko the secret rite of passage into manhood observed by the Xhosa tribe with homosexual scenes Nakhane received death threats on the films release which prompted their move to London When they arrived they had expected London to be a volcano of sensation but instead found it anticlimactic The queer scene in Johannesburg is much more exhilarating Theres a sense of experimentation that doesnt exist here They consider London home now but also see the UK as a place that refuses to reconcile with its history and its current state When I lived in Port Elizabeth it was a British colony British culture was something we learned all the time how much better it was they say But I do not aspire to whiteness or European culture What I have been given in South Africa is so fulfilling Still they want to stress that they love living here Ill tell you why You know that old painting that you always wanted to see You can go and see it The band that would never come to Africa You can go and see them here Bastard Jargon is the light at the end of the tunnel in many ways Its about sex morality politics and identity but its also a project of joy embarking on a new sonic and stylistic journey The process of creating the album was different too Instead of writing to chords I would layer drums first It was this sense of a new beginning Lead single Tell Me Your Politik featuring Nile Rodgers and Moonchild Sanelly is uptempo hyperpercussive and features South African gqom and kwaito Nakhane had known since 2013 that they wanted to make a rhythmic dance album but it wasnt until touring wrapped for You Will Not Die that the timing felt right That album was based on so much trauma I just couldnt make that kind of music any more I was exhausted from singing sad songs The only way I was going to be creative again was if I swung to the other side Theres a level of stubbornness an artist must have in order to be great according to Nakhane who cites Erykah Badu Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye as people who always followed their hearts Shabaka Hutchings who announced on Instagram that 2023 would be his last year of performing publicly Am I mad that he is putting down the saxophone Hell yes But if thats what he needs to do who am I to argue The idea of success is forever shifting for Nakhane Theyre not interested in accumulating excessive wealth because do we need any more billionaires Still there was a time when their selfesteem was attached to quantifiable things like money and fans They are learning to let those kinds of ideals go I want to be able to pay my rent I want to be able to go on holiday I want to be able to have a cup of coffee but I always try to remind myself I dont want to be a superrich artist Ive never seen one who makes anything worth noting Bastard Jargon is an opportunity for Nakhane to reach new heights and audiences This existential sex album leans more toward pop than past projects but its also their loudest and most queer I always have to remind people  you know those queer people that are in your face and that you think are too much Im just like them Im not any better Im never going to be a wellbehaved token One thing they know for certain is that they no longer want to compete with people who look like them I had a conversation with myself that I shouldnt compete with other people particularly Black artists particularly Black artists from South Africa I dont want to be the only Black queer person in the room I want us all to be there,entertainment

the UK he explains its allurePlenty of Hollywood,Plenty of Hollywood stars started out in improv Amy Poehler Bill Murray Mike Myers they all got noticed on the improv stage then moved on to loftier things What makes Ben Schwartz different is th 4822 chars,Plenty of Hollywood stars started out in improv Amy Poehler Bill Murray Mike Myers  they all got noticed on the improv stage then moved on to loftier things What makes Ben Schwartz different is that even as his Tinseltown career rockets  he is in Apple TVs The Afterparty and the forthcoming NicolasCageasDracula movie Renfield and is the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog  he just wont leave his muchmaligned first love behind With the specials and with this tour says Schwartz the goal is to show that improv is fun exciting and freeing That like standup it can be done successfully in front of thousands of people Those Netflix specials under the banner Middleditch  Schwartz are three fantastic longform improv shows not sketches but a whole hourlong story performed with his occasional sidekick Thomas Middleditch It is the streaming platforms first experiment with live improv The tour is Ben Schwartz  Friends which has been circulating North America in the rare gaps between the 41yearolds acting work and is coming to London I cant tell you how excited I am to get on that stage in England and do a show says Schwartz his motormouth positivity buzzing across the transatlantic Zoom line Netflix said Whats going to happen on stage And we said We dont know Schwartz started out as a dogsbody at the NYC improv club Upright Citizens Brigade UCB paying with his labour for access to the work of Poehler Tina Fey and co Soon improvising himself he carved a niche with sketches and contributions to the Funny or Die platform and the web series Jake  Amir Since the beginning he says I was always like Im going to find a way to do this I tried everything I freelanced writing for David Letterman I freelanced for SNL I did commercials I tried standup I tried everything hoping something would stick and I could be in this industry I loved Aged 29 he sealed the deal when cast alongside Aziz Ansari as the unjustifiably cocky JeanRalphio on Poehlers hit sitcom Parks and Recreation It was a careermaking turn  but it didnt break Schwartzs bond with improv OK so making up comedy on the hoof pays zero dollars and is afforded nearzero credibility in the entertainment landscape Any time I tell people I do improv says Schwartz their only reference is their friends class shows at college And my class shows were horrific I didnt know what I was doing So I think peoples perception is based on watching performers starting out who havent put the hours in They have nothing to point to like a special from anybody to say Look how good this can be Watch the trailer for the improvised Netflix specials Middleditch  Schwartz Thats where Middleditch  Schwartz comes in although even that was a hard sell Netflix said Whats going to happen on stage And we said We dont know They said But youll have an idea And we said We dont have anything What persuaded the channel was Schwartzs rising stardom and the novel commercial argument that whereas standups take a year to develop each set every time we do a show says Schwartz its a new special I can give you two new specials every day We filmed for one weekend and Netflix got three pieces of hourlong content With his new tour Schwartz continues the same crusade redeeming the reputation of improv for delirious thousandsstrong audiences One of his tricks is to dragoon celeb pals  improv virgins all  into taking part Don Cheadle JJ Abrams Stranger Things Joe Keery  I just want to share it with them And then watching the audience watching these people do it for the first time thats such a fun thing Its all about the fun for Schwartz Improv doesnt pay like the other things but its the thing that makes me happiest I can imagine his agent pulling out their hair that their hotproperty client keeps disappearing off on improv tours Watch Schwartz as JohnRalphio in Parks and Recreation I film MondaytoFriday get on the plane do my shows on Saturday and by the time Monday rolls around Im acting again Im so tired But in a million years I couldnt have thought Id have done any of this says the selfdefined little Jewish guy from the Bronx who is starring  well voiceacting  alongside his childhood hero Jim Carrey in the Sonic the Hedgehog films But let me tell you a fun story he says I was interning at UCB way back when to pay for classes I did the garbage I gave people their tickets And at the end of the show after everybody had gone and wed cleaned the theatre me and my friends Adam Pally and Gil Ozeri later the sketch group Hot Sauce would ask the manager Can we just get on stage for 10 minutes right now And so wed go on stage in the dark and do shows for nobody And we would make each other laugh and laugh And those are some of my fondest memories I get emotional thinking about it Improv is playtime for me And Ill keep doing it until people dont want me to do it any more,entertainment

casually summoned like postpub Ubers All the wellheeled angst that makes you almost not quite forgive them their great wealth Its all on warped view again in the first episode titled The Munsters as

whose supple script stealthy plotting and lurching twists provide all the mood music you need Though in this coolly subdued opener its hard to know whats uncoiling A motorway pileup of estrangements

Carol was like Pip raised in a blacksmithing family how could his take not be interesting Moreover demented jilted bride Miss Havisham played here by Olivia Colman is one of the undisputed bigticket

Guy Garvey with whom she has a sixyearold son How are preparations for Private Lives They are full of joy It is one of the most pleasurable parts to play and story to tell  this very passionate narcissistic combustive dangerous costly and hilarious relationship And to be able to do it in the Donmar where no audience member is more than four rows away They are in your armpit they can smell the sweat and see up your nostrils so youve got to be on your game or you will be exposed The Observers 1930 review of the original production noted that the play could not stand up to the slightest clumsiness in the acting Do you agree Yes I do You have to have two actors who trust each other totally and who arent playing stupid fucking ego games outside of the stupid fucking ego games that their characters are playing Otherwise youd have just too many explosions going on Guy and my son will just improvise songs or gags Its made me less afraid of constantly coming up with daft shit So its a nightmare being paired with Stephen Mangan Laughs Steve Mangan is just the dream There are many actors whose balls you have to cup in order to be able to More laughter If you have a funnier line you have to sort of soften the blow But not this man this man can stand up to anything How does your version differ from other revivals Were doing the grittiest version of it Weve got some proper

a nervous improviser but now Guy and my son will just improvise songs or gags and Ill join in Hes made me less afraid of constantly coming up with daft shit Less afraid of that little critic on your

went to go and work in a pub for a bit And do some peoplewatching and clean up some sick It was very grounding Did the break make you appreciate acting When I was much younger I was sent off for auditions for a Bond movie Casino Royale And I just remember I thought This is not me I dont feel like a Bond girl This is awful I found myself being told what it was I ought to want and it was never

Carraways black comedy as if to borrow one of many visceral images from it it were a coffeecolonic induced poo thrown at me Rain Dogs comedy is so black at first it seems to obliterate any possibility of light or warmth The stark opposite of funny Despairinducing in fact However just as I urge you to stick with this nasty brutish series please read on We meet Daisy May Coopers Costello Jones  sober 99 days  as shes being evicted from her council flat with her daughter Iris Episode one sees her go on a desperate hunt around London to find them a bed for the night They try to sleep in a launderette They break into a friends car so Iris can attempt her homework Finally they take the last available option inevitably the most dangerous one and bed down in the cupboard of a pervert pervert is a word that comes up a lot in Rain Dogs Also nonce And whore He makes Costello put on a pink satin nightie and tells her not to worry because shes not fat shes just got a food bank body Shes rescued by best friend Florian Selby a filthy rich entitled selfannihilating classical homosexual with strong Withnail vibes whos just been released from prison The halfhour of hijinks ends with them breaking into Costellos old flat right back where they started See what I mean about despairinducing But I keep watching and my ear starts to tune into the bracingly strong cadences of Carraways Bukowskian voice Beneath the ballast of shock violence and bawdy language shes quietly skewering the grotesque realities of class and sex inequality like virtually no one else Its writing that pushes you to the edge then holds your head over it so you can see how things really are It takes a little time to adjust to the high altitude By the end of the second episode Im acclimatised Fully invested in the resilience and brilliance of Costello Selbys razor wit his monstrous mother Allegra Anna Chancellor on killer form and the glorious Gloria Ronke Adekoluejo who works in her dads funeral parlour where shes been known to take the occasional selfie with a hot dead guy By the time Gloria is describing the four whores of the apocalypse to Iris as Moll Flanders official whore Divine Brown iconic whore Julia Roberts made every girl want to be one And Billie Piper ITV whore I am laughing my head off As would Piper and Lucy Prebble as Rain Dogs shares some of the brutal surreal horror of their show I Hate Suzie Cooper as no one who saw her in This Country will be surprised to hear is magnificent Her Costello is defiant broken authentic and a master of saying all that can never be said with the tiniest downturn of her mouth No wonder shes being touted as the next M in James Bond I can totally see it Theres a scene in which she goes to clean the house of an incurably ill painter  and yes pervert  Adrian Edmondson in vintage Bottom mode whos been banned from the 2 peep show where she works for reasons you can imagine As she polishes a glass table with a series of highpitched squeaks he finishes himself off Afterwards Costello pops his oxygen mask back on for him takes her cash and says with warmth and sarcasm Its an awful life we live but we do it with such dignity Lots happens fast Costello is propositioned by a journalist while dancing at the peep show and urged to tell her story She dreams of being a writer so says yes Of course shes screwed over and ends up shagging the photographer a poverty voyeur whom she whispers to in bed You feel like Louis Theroux on one of his weird weekends dont you Carraways writing about class is genius Costello Selby and Iris run away to the country and pretend to be a functional rich family as if such a thing exists It ends in a punchup and purgatory for them all a rehab unit for Selby and for Costello and for Iris a womens refuge where the only rule is we lay low and let the lord guide us Dear god Iris Fleur Tashjian though is too fundamentally sweet and unscarred considering what shes been through Even with a mother as loving as Costello she would be a mess Eventually  for the revelations come in a slow dripdrip in Rain Dogs  we see why Costello is as she is She goes home for the first time in 15 years Its a painful incomplete and beautifully controlled scene from the delay in her mum coming down to see her because shes just dropped a bath bomb to the arrival of her awful brother who insists shes an impostor Why would I want this life Costello says with a mirthless laugh That is a life shaped by abuse Rain Dogs is not really a comedy at all Its a bleak and beautiful drama in which the rare laughs are a matter

home And Elias Jahshans mother sends him a homebaked care package every year Maamoul is a semolinabased biscuit stuffed with a variety of fillings  usually dates pistachios or walnuts  often dusted with icing sugar Its served in many Levantine cultures around the festive seasons  including Easter or Eid alFitr which fall just two weeks apart this year Maamoul moulds for different faiths the moulds come in different patterns and shapes with particular meanings They can also be used to denote different fillings Photograph Luisa Brimble Nader says maamoul takes her back to her mothers kitchen the smell of rosewater and icing sugar She has saved all of her late mothers moulds knowing that good ones are now hard to come by I found my own after a yearslong search prompting a deluge of messages from people asking where they can get some too I remember teaching my religion classes about the reason that maamoul is the Easter biscuit Nader says The shape is the tomb of Christ and the sweetness of the resurrection is hidden until Christ broke through death Maamoul is so beloved by the communities who make it its mere mention can be transportive  a portal back in time Jahshan who says hes not that religious appreciates the biscuits that arrive to his London home even knowing the contents will be crumbled or crusty from their journey For mother and daughter Sivine Tabbouch and Karima Chloe Hazim maamoul runs through their blood Traditionally maamoul is made in generous quantities as they are shared with friends and family Photograph Luisa Brimble These days they run Lebanese cooking school Sunday Kitchen together But when Hazim was little they made kilos of biscuits to give to relatives friends and neighbours at Eid alFitr  the celebration which ends the monthlong Ramadan fast When you make it at home its a very sensory experience Hazim says Youre using your hands youre tapping on a wooden mould  and then theres the aroma the sight of them piled high on the table after theyve come out of the oven Serena Tajjour who runs her mothers bakery Smd Al Maamoul on Instagram says they have been flat out due to the close proximity of festivities this year Now at capacity theyve had to add a disclaimer to notify customers that if any spare boxes of maamoul become available this information will be posted on Instagram We are nervous Im not going to lie Tajjour says We were booked out early for Easter and Eid early last year This year we planned to be more prepared but we are a little overwhelmed Maamoul is a labour of love The bakery experiments with twists on the traditional maamoul much like Lebanese pastry chef Phil Khoury who offers a plantbased alternative to the recipe in his forthcoming book A New Way to Bake Maamoul he says is a commonality in a region often divided over faith ideology and politics In my immediate family maamoul were served around Easter he says Then I went to Lebanon and saw them served for Ramadan Now I live in London and have also seen Jews share these at Purim Every religious group in the Middle East celebrates something around roughly the same time with these filled biscuits Great maamoul according to Tabbouch comes down to highquality ingredients  the best ghee you can find the freshest nuts and no shortcuts The semolina drinks the butter while it rests she says Hazim suggests it is best made in groups so everyone has a distinct role kneading moulding baking I think there is something in how maamoul bridges a huge geographical divide via family and cultural tradition Jahshan says It invokes a sense of home and nostalgia with the love language of food When Roumieh published her short story on the sweets I wanted to write about something special to me she says but also something

mould kg raw pistachios shelled 1 cup sugar  cup orange blossom water For the walnut filling use a round wooden mould  kg raw walnuts 1 cup sugar  cup orange blossom water To make the dough you will need a very large mixing bowl large enough to fit your arms in as you will need to mix and knead the dough by hand In a small saucepan warm the milk over low heat until just warmer than skin temperature Remove from the heat and add the yeast then allow the pan to stand for a few minutes In the large mixing bowl add both the semolinas sugar and softened butter followed by the rosewater orange blossom water and mahlab then the milk and yeast mixture Using your hands rub the butter into the semolina while thoroughly combining and kneading all the ingredients together to form a soft wellincorporated dough The aim is to form a soft round ball with filling inside to place into your mould Photograph Luisa Brimble Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and set aside to rest in a cool dry place for four hours Meanwhile make the fillings For the pistachio filling place the pistachios sugar and orange blossom water in a food processor and crush for a few seconds or until you have broken down the nuts and incorporated them with the water It should be a textured crumb rather than a finely ground mixture For the walnut filling repeat the process with the walnuts sugar and orange blossom water Once your dough has rested for four hours preheat your oven to 180C fan or 200C conventional Line a few baking trays with baking paper As you shape and fill the maamoul you will need to knead the dough in the bowl to loosen the mixture so it fits well into your moulds To make a maamoul roll a small handful of dough roughly 40g into a ball and place it in the palm of your hand Place your index finger in the ball and work the sides of the dough against the palm of your hand rotating it as you go to form a hollow pocket Add a teaspoon of your chosen nut filling then seal the edges of the dough to completely enclose the filling The aim is to form a soft round ball with no leaking filling to place in your mould Dont be discouraged if your first is not perfect Photograph Luisa Brimble Press the ball into the patterned side of the mould flatten the top with your hand then gently bang the mould on your chopping board to release your maamoul Dont be discouraged if your first is not perfect  you will get better with each attempt Repeat until you have used all of your filling and dough There might be a little bit of one filling or the other left over Place your maamoul on the lined baking trays and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown Remove from the oven and allow to them to cool on the baking trays Do not handle the maamoul immediately as they will be very delicate while hot and will firm up after theyve cooled When the maamoul have cooled use a spatula or pastry scraper to gently remove them from the baking paper If eating immediately generously dust with icing sugar and serve If you wish to store and keep some maamoul for later do not dust these with icing sugar until you wish to serve them Undusted maamoul will keep for up to three months in an airtight container stored in a cool dry place or in the fridge,entertainment

to bring attention to an issue his party has campaigned on enthusiastically for the past two years and with increasing cutthrough As Davey leads Marvin along the shingle 60 miles away in west London the environment secretary Thrse Coffey is announcing a series of partly recycled policies to clean up waterways an explicit acknowledgment of the damage the issue is causing to the government Lib Dem research shows pollution outflows both on beaches and into rivers and chalk streams is one of the most pertinent issues for voters in affected areas ahead of the local elections on 4 May Protesters outside a Thames Water sewage treatment works in Buckinghamshire Photograph Maureen McLeanRexShutterstock Josh Babarinde a Lib Dem councillor in Eastbourne who is also the candidate for the Conservativeheld parliamentary seat a key target for the party says sewage is raised spontaneously as often as the NHS during local door knocking It is one of the most common issues that comes up on the doorstep Beaches are the lifeblood of this town Speaking after the next leg in his day of campaigning a tour around the vast and hitech warehouse of a locally based book wholesaler Davey says sewage has even supplanted that perennial issue in local elections the pothole Its much bigger than potholes he said Potholes are a very serious issue and they do move votes but for sewage the reason why its so dramatic is it brings the pollution of our natural environment and the damage that its doing to our rivers and our seas and wildlife and plants and animals to human health The rise of sewage as an electoral issue is notable for several reasons one of which is how the Lib Dems chipped away at it for so long without notable interest from other parties It reached Lib Dem campaigners radar when voters in Chesham and Amersham kept bringing it up before the partys stunning byelection victory over the Conservatives in June 2021 the starting point for the idea of a blue wall of vulnerable Tory commuter belt seats When we started talking about sewage two years ago the other parties though it was a bit weird says one Lib Dem official But now they all want to talk about it This is very much the case Last week before Coffeys plan for cleaner water emerged a group of Conservative MPs representing Sussex seats met jointly with Southern Water and the Environment Agency in an attempt to spur action on a subject many fear is electorally damaging to them Labour too is very much aware of the subject with Keir Starmer accusing the government last week of turning Britains

voters becoming disenchanted with a government they feel is out of touch and takes them for granted Its the classic environmental issue where youre despoiling a public good and its the governments responsibility to stop it through regulation says Davey whose local election campaign schedule involves as one official put it a sewagerelated visit more or less every day This set of local elections is Davey says in effect a dry run for a general election expected next year not least as internal party polling suggests a majority of former Tory voters who switch to the Lib Dems in May will stay with them This set of seats was last fought in 2019 when the Lib Dems won more than 700 councillors as the Conservatives and Labour struggled under the leadership of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn respectively Defending those seats let alone winning more is a tough ask but Davey is confident the party riding what could be termed a sewage tidal wave can do it Doing better than 2019 perhaps our best local elections ever would really be something he said I think it would send a real shiver amongst the Tories They would see us coming for them,entertainment
