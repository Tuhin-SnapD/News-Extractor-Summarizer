Its where a lot of Twitter users have gone in our postElon Musk era. The idea of Mastodon is that you dont join a single platform that one company controls. You join a server and that server can show you content from users across the entire network. If you decide you dont like the people who run your server or you think theyre moderating content too strictly you can leave and take your followers and social graph with you. Think about it like email and youll get it. If you dont like Gmail you can switch to something else but you dont have to quit email entirely as a concept. Now if you are like me you hear the words open source and decentralized and then the word CEO and think wait why does the decentralized open standard have a CEO? The whole point is that no single person or company is in charge right? Well welcome to the wild world of opensource governance. Its a riot my friends. Youre going to hear me and Eugen say the phrase benevolent dictator for life in dead seriousness because thats how a lot of these projects are run. Of course we also talk about money and structure. Mastodon doesnt make a lot of money and Eugen is figuring out how to build a structure that scales past just a handful of people. This tiny and mostly volunteer labor of love might very well be the future of social networking and if you believe the hype about ActivityPub might have some part in the future of the web. Thats pretty exciting even if things seem a little messy in the moment. The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Eugen Rochko is the founder and CEO of Mastodon. Welcome to Decoder. Hi. Hello. Its very nice to have you here. Mastodon is having quite a moment but I know youve been working on this project for a long time. I think theres actually quite a lot to talk about. Yes indeed. Lets start at the very beginning. Mastodon is in popular conversation right now as a competitor to Twitter but thats not really what it is and not really where it started. What is Mastodon? I mean its not that far off from where it started. I started working on it in 2016 because I thought that something as important as Twitter should not be in the hands of a single company. I was a pretty heavy Twitter user back then  I think I started using it in 2008 or so when I was a teenager  and it quickly became a very important part of my life for talking to friends or finding out what was happening in the world. Around 2016 I felt fed up with how Twitter was being run as a company where it was heading the community that was on there the harassment and so on. I started looking into alternatives and after viewing the landscape I decided to build a product of my own  and tried to make it good. I appreciate that. What I mean specifically by Its not exactly like Twitter is that Twitter is a company. Up until recently it was a publicly traded company that had investor reports had to make a profit and had employees that controlled the entire product. Mastodon is not that in almost any way. Indeed. Mastodon is free and opensource software that allows you to create a social media server or platform that connects to a decentralized network of similar servers all talking the same protocol and allowing not only different Mastodon servers to exchange information but also other software that speaks the same protocol. Its a very powerful ecosystem with a lot of potential. When you say youre the CEO of Mastodon but the product itself is opensource software that anybody can run how does that work? What are you actually the CEO of? Listen to Decoder a show hosted by The Verges Nilay Patel about big ideas  and other problems. Subscribe here! I am the CEO of the company Mastodon which works on the software called Mastodon. Its slightly confusing perhaps but its also fairly straightforward about who is making the software. Its us and we have the same name. For the longest time it was just me. I started working on this in 2016 when I was still in uni. After graduating I started a Patreon page for it which was 5 per month for a while. Then it gradually increased to making I dont know like 200 per month or 600 per month. It was enough for me to live off of in my situation back then and I started working on it fulltime. I was technically a sole proprietor which is a type of way to do business in Germany you basically just represent yourself as a company. That went on for a long time actually until 2021 which is when we finally incorporated a separate legal entity for Mastodon. Over time we got more people contributing to the code. Some were on a voluntary basis and there were a lot of driveby contributors on GitHub. Over 700 people have contributed lines of code to the software. There are also people we work with regularly such as the contractors that I hired. Right now compared to where it started its quite a sizable company. Theres me who is a fulltime employee developer CEO whatever you want to call it and another developer Claire. We also have a CFO on a contract basis and a talent manager and we are hiring for three more positions fulltime. We have two developers working on our iOS app and one developer working on the Android app all contractors. Then there is a user experience design agency that works with us on a contract basis. Thats about it but it is quite a lot of people to manage. So the company itself  and Im just keeping a rough count here  has four fulltime people a handful of contractors and an outside agency? Well currently there are two fulltime people but were hiring for three more. In the end it would be five people. Is the talent manager also on a contract basis? Yes. Okay. Decoder for me is all about structure. How do these things happen? How do we put these companies together? For Mastodon theres a lot of pressure on the protocol and theres a lot of interest in it. There are a lot of new servers being spun up. Then theres having to develop and manage the development of a large opensource project like Mastodon itself. How do you split the time between all the things people want Mastodon to do all the features people might wish to add to it and you actually running your company? Im not going to lie it has been quite tough since November. For most of Mastodons lifetime it wasnt as difficult because the pressure on the project was much lower even during busy times. I mean Mastodon didnt just pop up out of nowhere in November 2022. We had our runins with global fame even going as far back as 2017. Thats when it went viral for the first time and magazines like Mashable and The Verge covered us. In hindsight it was much lower pressure back then. I was able to manage on my own but now clearly the pressure is much much larger. Its not enough for just me to be involved in the project. It needs to expand there needs to be more people working in different areas and there needs to be more delegation. Since November it has basically been a whole ongoing project within our company to figure out the hiring process because were basically hiring for the first time. As you can tell from the story I told about the development of the company the first step is basically going from just me to more people and more fulltime employees. Its a huge step and its a new process for us so were spending a lot of time figuring out Okay these are the key roles that we need to fill as soon as possible. Again were also dealing with a limited budget even though a lot more people donated through our Patreon in November. It was a huge explosion of funds  going from 7000 per month to 30000 per month. That is a big budget increase which allowed us to look into hiring more people but its still a constrained budget. So we had to figure out Okay these are the key positions that will have maximum impact on what Mastodon is doing as a company. We decided we need a DevOps person because I cant be running the company and solving technical issues 247. We need another developer so somebody else can work with Claire when Im not around. We need a product designer. We got this far with me doing the design and figuring out usability and user experience but Im not actually qualified to do that. And I want Mastodon to be the best product it can be. I want it to be polished and I want it to be on par with any commercial alternative you might throw at it. Its really important for me to find the right design person who would also be able to take ownership and initiative at this stage. A lot of larger companies have whole teams working on delegated tasks but in our case we have to find somebody whos able to multitask a little bit and fill the role that I had to fill until now. I want to come back to all of that because I think its very interesting. Just being on this podcast a lot of people are going to come talk to you and Im very curious to see how that goes. But I want to sit for one second in what I think of as the middle stage which very few people pay attention to. I always think about this when listening to the story of a band or something. The band forms they play one show in a garage and then everyone skips to them playing in stadiums. Youre kind of in the Oh boy we better staff up so we can play in stadiums part of the journey. That middle part for you is between 2016 2017 when we covered Mastodon as it launched and November which is when Elon bought Twitter and had all the attention. What made you stay convicted in Mastodon that this was a thing? Regardless of the big spikes of growth the challenges and the financial limits you had why did you stay focused on it? You were ready for the moment in November of 2022  the product was there the servers were there the ecosystem and the community was there. Its very important to be ready for the moment but you couldnt have possibly known it was coming. So what made you stay focused? Well I would argue that I couldnt possibly have known the moment was coming then but the writing was on the wall for me back in 2016 that something was going to happen sooner or later. Do you mean something with the big social networks or something with Twitter specifically? Nobodys talking about MySpace like its a relevant thing anymore... I never believed that Twitter would be completely immune to that. Just a shift because social media websites come and go. They die. Even if they stay around like MySpace did nobodys talking about MySpace like its a relevant thing anymore. There are plenty more that have literally disappeared like App.net Google Plus Friendster or whatever. It is a graveyard and I never believed that Twitter would be completely immune to that. You can see that for all seven years Ive worked on this with a preparation for this sort of thing just without knowing exactly when it would happen or what to do. It has been a long process of figuring out the right features the right designs and the right messaging how to do this and how to do that so I will not claim that I had all the details figured out from the start. It was a long process to figure stuff out. So youve described the financial journey here as 600 a month to 7000 a month to 30000 a month all on Patreon. Is there another source of revenue? Or another potential source of revenue? No thats pretty much it. Over the years we have created an additional platform for the highertier Patreon sponsors to give us money as a sponsorship which allows us to give them invoices back and save on Patreon fees a little bit. Thats the only thing. For the most part Mastodon is financed through Patreon and the platform we built for the higher tiers. Thats it. Last year we did receive a grant from NLnet which is a grant that comes from the European Commission for opensource projects that work on decentralized social networks. That was a little bit of site funding but it was a onetime thing. In the past there was another one a prototype fund project but that was more like a personal grant kind of thing. Sometimes you find grants that sponsor people who work on opensource projects and it can help continue working on this. To answer your original question on why I stuck around I believe in the vision. I believe that Mastodon is the better way to do social media. Ive stuck around because well Im dogfooding it. I am using it. Its my daily driver and I have a home feed that I look at every day. I share whats happening in my life or the music I listen to on my Mastodon profile. I most enjoy Caturday and looking through and sharing cat pictures every Saturday. So thats why Ive stuck around. Of course there is a personal element to this as well in that its kind of a cool job to have. Youre doing something unique. In a way youre getting paid to work for yourself at your own pace. Sometimes that means times are quiet and theres not much to do and unfortunately sometimes that means that you have to work pretty much nonstop. That can be extremely stressful and extremely draining like it has been for the past three months. That is the downside. Usually people go through that experience at a startup because they have equity and might go public or because they might sell the Facebook for a huge amount of return. Do you see that outcome for yourself? Will there be some kind of exit from Mastodon where youll reap some sort of massive financial reward? Or is it This is the vision. Its an opensource project and we need to stay focused and idealistic? Its not really why I went into this and no I dont see that. It is an opensource project it is free software theres nothing to be reaped from it but I think I see a good future for Mastodon growing both as a network and as a project. My wage right now is really rather low and for the most part thats because when new funds come into the project there are important things that need doing more than paying myself more money. But I am hoping that there will be a breakeven point where Ill be able to have a dignified wage as well. Fair enough. This is the classic Decoder question. Just listening to you it sounds like youve had to make an escalating set of ever more complicated decisions since you started this project and it was just you. Youre now at what might be the most fun part which is staffing up figuring out who to hire and how to hire. How do you make decisions? What is your framework to make decisions? A framework to make decisions sounds very serious indeed and it makes me wish that I had a more elaborate answer to that. Sometimes my decisionmaking is led by what the community is asking for but of course it all comes down to my vision for the project and what I think is right. That is my framework for considering community suggestions or community demands and figuring out what the project needs and what it should avoid. In the future I am really looking forward to having a more organized model for this kind of decisionmaking. The keyword that has been thrown around is participatory governance. Now Im not going to promise anything specific but that is something Im talking to a couple people about. One thing that I would want to get out of something like that is a more organized way of inferring community opinion about specific features or directions because at the moment it is quite chaotic. The main way that people can voice their opinion about what should or shouldnt be in Mastodon is issues on GitHub which is basically feature requests bug reports on our source code repository. If somebody submits a feature request how do you know if thats something a lot of people wanted and would benefit from or if thats something that only one person would benefit from and a whole bunch of people would hate? Right now its very chaotic. My wish is to find a way to have some kind of vehicle where people would feel like theyre represented. I would get a way to know theyve made their decision so I can then either go along with it or not. But I would know that theres some kind of backing to it instead of trying to figure out Okay 40 people on GitHub have given a thumbs up to this feature request. What does that mean for the 2 million people using Mastodon today? How you build a social network using the tools of social networking seems like a recursive problem. We could do the entire podcast and probably an entire conference on opensource governance models. There have been a lot of them over time and each of them has tradeoffs. Ill just use Linux as an example because Im confident the audience is familiar with it. At the top of Linux is Linus Torvalds and he literally has the title of Benevolent dictator for life of Linux and that is the governance model that flows down from that title. Are you thinking I have to pick one of these wellworn models? Thats how it is right now. Honestly I subscribe to that model. I think its effective and I think that it leads to a better product. A good product needs longterm vision and it needs cohesive vision. Thats something that a committee cannot give. When you have a lot of people who have pet issues and one thing that they care about it kind of ends up being a patchwork. It loses some of its focus and it can end up in a situation where it just stops being a good product and becomes too confusing. Sometimes you need to make executive decisions about changing stuff in a serious way which might not be popular with what most people in a committee would want. I dont look down on the benevolent dictator for life model. I think it has its place in open source at least. So I dont look down on the BDFL model. I think it has its place in open source at least. I would not make any comments or claims about other areas of life but in open source I think it makes sense. Thats what I would prefer to stick with but that doesnt mean I dont think theres better ways to involve other people and have better communication. One more question here and then I want to talk about Mastodon its community and how its working as an actual social platform. What youre describing right now is familiar in shape if not in the specifics. Its an opensource product that has found productmarket fit or at least the opportunity for productmarket fit. Its going to grow really fast and you need some help scaling. This is when venture capital firms show up at your door and say Look we know how to do DevOps. We can install a bunch of lawyers to help you figure out opensource governance. Look at all these tools. Heres a whole army of people that have done this before. Let us give you the money to help and well scale it as fast as we can. Has that been happening to you? Weve definitely had a lot of people from venture capital firms reach out to us. Weve even tried having a few conversations just to see where they were at and what they wanted. We obviously had considered ways to have a more sustainable funding model for the opensource project that would not rely on Patreon. We have explored if maybe there would be a way to find funding for that. I cannot say that anything productive has come out of it. Weve rejected every venture capital firm that has reached out to us so far. Now when I say a more sustainable funding model for the project I obviously mean software as a service because its the most natural way for an opensource project to basically find a business model for itself. You have a product that you have the most familiarity with and you can offer it to other people in a way where they dont have to figure out how to install it how to manage it and so on. It is quite natural and it has been on my mind for quite a few years as a sort of backup plan in case people stop donating to the Patreon for some reason. But theres a lot of activity in that space right now. A lot of these hosting firms are starting to jump up. I think we could have an edge in that space but it also doesnt seem like a priority right now if Im honest. Are you rejecting all the VC firms because the pitch is basically the same for all of them? Well give you a bunch of money and resources but were looking for 30X revenue growth or whatever? A hosting business is not really venture capital scale. It doesnt promise the same returns. What they seem to be interested in is Well give you money now and you dont have to think about monetizing but in two years lets figure out how we could turn your opensource project around. Thats kind of a nogo zone for me. Its a trap. Its clearly against our projects ideals. Lets talk about the Mastodon community and the product. So I kind of understand the company now. I understand very clearly that you have a specific set of ideals  about how you want to run the company about the nature of decentralized social networks and about moderation. I do want to talk about all those things. Right now the basics of the community are that you download the Mastodon software from Mastodon the company. You can spin up your own server and try to get your own users for it. Then you can in a federated way send messages back and forth across these servers. How many users does Mastodon have now across instances? God. I am actually unprepared for this question because the statistics API on our official website has not been functional for a couple days. I need to change the code a little bit to make it more efficient. I have actually not kept up with it but I would say at least 1.5 million monthly active users. Okay. In November when Elon took over Twitter you saw a huge spike. What does that spike look like? That spike was 2.5 million monthly active users. So it has gone down since then? Yeah but theres a caveat to that spike. The way that active users are counted on Mastodon in the software is when you log in and every person who signs up logs in. Its kind of inflated through people who sign up and then bounce so its natural for it to go back down to more natural levels. Its just an unfortunate side effect of how the statistics were implemented in it. Its impressive because the big number highlights how many people checked out Mastodon but its also normal for that number to go back down to a more level area again. Are you still growing? Yes its still growing and in fact its growing faster now than it was before because of some changes we did to our official labs as well as the changes we did to the official joinmastodon.org website. I adjusted the sorting to highlight bigger servers first. Its a big change from what it used to be where we tried to highlight smaller servers. A lot of them at the top were the ones where you cant create and cast straight away but you have to wait for approval. That was just not very userfriendly. Now the ones with larger open registrations are at the top. Of course that has had a very quick effect on increasing the growth. Similar changes have been made in the official apps as well as the onboarding improvements in general that weve been working on since November. Theyve finally been released on both iOS and Android. They include both a better explanation of what the hell decentralization is and what the servers are before you get thrown into the server list. Also changes to the server list allow a bit more sorting and displaying information in a better way. It also provides a pick for me option where if you dont make a selection it gives you a random one. I have an account on mastodon.social which is the one that you run. By the way I follow Eugen. Hes not kidding with the cats thing in case youre listening. That was 100 percent true. But theres all sorts of other servers. What are the economics of running one of those servers? To me that is one of the most difficult things to understand. I spin up a Mastodon server on Squarespace or whatever hosting company wants to let me do this very easily. I run it I get users and I have to pay Squarespace. Do I the administrator of the server make any money? Is there anything built into the platform that lets me make any money doing this? When you host Mastodon for yourself youre in control. You own it. It is your megaphone. No not really. Its not really about making money off of hosting Mastodon. Its that when you host Mastodon for yourself youre in control. You own it. It is your megaphone. Nobody can kick you out tell you what you can or cannot say or take your data and sell it to a third party. Its your complete ownership over your own social media platform without losing global reach because people can follow you from other servers. Hosting a Mastodon server for yourself your family or a small private group of people that you know is really relatively simple and not too expensive. You do need either a hosting provider somebody who will offer Mastodon as a service or a small virtual private server from DigitalOcean or a similar hosting company. If you have the knowhow to install programs on Linux and run them you can just install Mastodon you just need your own domain name and there you go. When you run the server for yourself you dont really need to think about things like moderation because youre just responding for yourself. Obviously youll need to block bad actors and stuff but youre just doing it for yourself you dont have to worry about community management. Then a completely different side from this is when you want to run a server for a community or the public. Its a whole different level of responsibility and it obviously involves moderation burdens. You need to moderate or find people who will moderate for you. Sometimes for smaller communities people just do it out of their pocket because the community matters to them or its an offshoot of their main community website like if they have a forum and get a Mastodon server as a bonus value add to that. We could actually talk about Medium as an example of that because Medium has spun up their own Mastodon server. Now they are a publishing platform for longform articles for writers. What do writers do? They usually announce what theyve written on social media in short form content. Mastodon is a perfect fit for them to basically offer it as a valueadd. You have your Medium account and you can sign into Mastodon to post about what youve just written on Medium and drive traffic to your writings that way. Thats one example of how it fits with something that already exists. Of course for other cases the Mastodon servers that arent monetized  if thats the right word  are through Patreon. Basically people are providing a service and then some people who value that service donate back to keep it afloat. So mastodon.social is the one that Mastodon the company runs? Correct. That is I would say the most famous one for lack of a better word. You open signups you close signups. Why do you sometimes close signups? In the past it has been a huge burden especially when I was working alone to wrestle with the scaling problems or the technical issues of running a largescale server at the same time as running a company and writing code. Thats just one side of it. The other side is that ideologically speaking Mastodon is a decentralized social network. We dont want to promote a single node more than other ones. The ideal system is one where there are a whole bunch of different servers all roughly the same size and it doesnt matter which one you use because theyre all interconnected. Because when you get to a situation where one single node is much much bigger than all the others the problem is that it gets disproportionate power to change things and enforce its own whims. An example of that is email and the situation with Gmail. Gmail is huge. They have very good spam filters but unfortunately those good spam filters sometimes catch people who try to selfhost email. It creates a situation where its so difficult to selfhost email that youre basically forced to just go use Gmail or one of the other large providers instead. Thats the kind of situation we ideally want to avoid in Mastodon and in the fediverse which is the name for the network that Mastodon is basically a part of based on this activity protocol. We want to avoid that so for that reason we have historically been trying to promote a healthy distribution of people across these different servers. However Ive learned over the years that there is no replacement for having a default right? Im sure you realize. When people are used to just going on a website and creating an account presenting them with a choice of hundreds of different servers all provided by different people and organizations that they dont know it is quite a paradigm shift. Its quite difficult for people to grasp at first sight. The power of somebody like Elon in the fediverse is greatly diminished. Really it is a strength of the platform that there is such a diversity of offerings. On Twitter you just have Elon Musk. If he decides to do X theres nothing you can do about it. On Mastodon you still have the potential for a mini Elon in some ways but unlike Twitter you have the option to just take your account and go somewhere else or to start your own and still participate in the network. The power of somebody like Elon in the fediverse is greatly diminished. Thats the strength of it but to realize that strength you basically need to be into the idea already. For that we need a simple conversion a simple signup that people can go through without too much hassle or being presented with a completely different way to do things thatll make them say Its too complicated I cant choose. Thats what Ive realized over the years. The idea right now is to keep registrations open and continue having them open to the best of our ability. The only situation I can think of where we might close signups temporarily is if there are technical issues that affect quality of service. If lots of new people are joining and the servers are melting down the priority for us is to ensure that the people who are already using our server can continue to do so with good quality of service. If that means closing signups and directing people elsewhere then so be it. But the way we are expanding the company hiring a dedicated DevOps person and getting new funds I think will allow us to keep registrations open going forward. The Gmail comparison is really interesting here. I cannot believe Im about to explain Gmail to the Decoder audience but Im going to do it just so Ive said it out loud. Email is an open protocol that is run by standards organizations. Gmail runs on those protocols  SMTP IMAP and the rest  and so does Outlook or whatever. The reality for most people is that theres a collapse between the protocol and the application on their phone. If you have Outlook you are almost certainly not using the Gmail app. If you have Gmail you are almost certainly not using the Outlook app. Youre going to the service and putting that app on your phone. The only real exception to this rule is the Apple Mail app on the iPhone. With everything else theres a collapse between the protocol and how its expressed to the user. mastodon.social is the one you run. You download the official Mastodon app and its going to default you into it because defaults are important. I mean literally the number one criticism I hear from people is Well you have to pick a server and itll never work because no one wants to pick a server. Youre going to solve that problem but arent you now getting closer to that collapse between the open protocol and the user experience where people download the Mastodon app and end up on the Mastodon server? Well for reference right now mastodon.social isnt actually the default in our app. Its just one of the top ones that shows up. However I think that possibly going forward we might rework the onboarding user experience into presenting a default option as well as an advanced option where all that stuff with choosing a server would basically be hidden away from the people who get intimidated by choice. Yes you are correct in that it gets us closer to the Gmail situation. But its kind of unavoidable with the constraints of the problem Ive described where the choice is too complicated. You need to convince people that this is better and that this is something they should invest some time into. Then theyll realize both how it works and what they can do with it. That is the idea. The idea is the funnel. They get started on mastodon.social but afterwards they can move to an account on their own server that they create or on a different server provided by a different company or person. Historically that has been the case. A lot of people who are currently running their own servers had their first account on mastodon.social. So it is working and I imagine it will make mastodon.social somewhat disproportionately large in the future but thats just part of making it work I think. Is there a point at which the cost of mastodon.social will be too much and youll have to actually monetize it directly? Its hard to say if the cost will be too much and its equally hard to say if there will ever be a point where some kind of monetization is absolutely necessary. One thing that Ive looked into as part of our software offering as part of the Mastodon software somewhere down the line is a way for admins to monetize account creation to offer paid accounts like a premium email service would do. I think thats a very fair way to monetize. Right now its what people manage to do with Patreon basically an honor system and you just codify it into the software. Okay I pay you this amount per month and for that I receive an account and good quality of service. That makes sense to me. I cant say for sure if we ourselves will ever make use of something like that. Its hard to predict so long in advance and with unknown growth as well but it is something I want to make available for other admins so that there can be more sustainable business models in the fediverse. I realize I keep asking about money but one of the reasons I keep asking is that if you want to be a success on the scale youre talking about it actually needs to become an ecosystem. There need to be multiple kinds of business models and businesses using the protocol and using Mastodon. Thats what makes it resilient to change in a way that MySpaces business was not. Are you open to saying Okay some people are going to monetize this thing in a way that maybe I personally dont like or Im ideologically opposed to but in order for the ecosystem to thrive lots of people have to be trying lots of different things? Well I dont know about something that I would be ideologically opposed to. Youre one of the few CEOs Ive talked to that will state their values as clearly as you have so thats why I asked it that way. I think a diversity of business models in the fediverse would be a good thing. I think different people exploring different ways to do stuff in this ecosystem would benefit everyone. The bad business models would fail and the good ones would thrive hopefully. At the end of the day I think its good to be able to support these different business models. I think companies are eager to start building on top of the fediverse because for the first time in history its an ecosystem where one company cannot just pull the rug from under them by closing the APIs. Its open source so its built on open protocols. The API literally cannot be locked down in the way that Twitter is doing right now or has promised to do. When the developers from Tapbots build their Ivory app the premium paid iOS app for Mastodon they know for sure that I am not going to pull the rug from under them and they lose their existence. I welcome apps like that being built on top of the Mastodon API and I welcome other software being built on top of the ActivityPub protocol that integrates with Mastodon. I think its very exciting that Tumblr has announced ActivityPub support that Flickr has expressed interest in it. I was very happy when Vivaldi the browser announced their own Mastodon server. Mozilla has announced the same and Medium. Its extremely exciting. Those companies are announcing support for ActivityPub which is the underlying protocol from Mastodon. We had Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg on the show. He said ActivityPub is great. Fundamentally this is all blogging. My whole company is blogging whether its Tumblr WordPress.com or whatever. Were going to support this and be in full support of blogging. We talked to Mitchell Baker from Mozilla. She said Mastodon is really interesting. This is where Im pointed. First were just going to set up an instance and see how it works. You can see the turn there for her is building some ActivityPub support directly into the browser itself. Do you worry that Heres a lot of attention from big companies theyre just going to spin up their own massive instances or that Tumblr will become a sort of strange new default ActivityPub source? That well kind of just end up back at Twitter but with an underlying opensource protocol? That is the Gmail problem right? Open source doesnt factor into the protocol bit. Twitter based on an open protocol would be a good thing even in its current state. You would be able to follow the people you care about and be followed back by them without engaging with the actual platform. Instead of being locked into one commercial service you would be allowed to leave and build your own platforms and do something better without fighting against the network effects of a lockedin commercial platform. I see it as a good development no matter what when more platforms are announcing support. It means that the network the fediverse becomes more useful for everybody. If we create a future where a whole bunch of social networks are interoperable based on ActivityPub its a great future. Ideally that is also open source and everything but even without that it would still be a better situation for the web than right now. One of the things about ActivityPub that is interesting is that its closer to format agnostic than the other Its very versatile. Right. Versatile is a good word for it. Just as Instagram is incompatible with a tweet from the jump or a TikTok is not compatible with a Facebook post from the jump. Theyre just not the same thing and you can see how much work was done internally to retrofit something that looks like TikTok onto Facebook. ActivityPub is more versatile than that. The posts can be long and they can contain multimode media be that pictures and text or whatever it is. Do you think that someone might fork it and make it more specific? The social platforms that tend to win are the ones that kind of funnel everybody towards a particular format that captures the zeitgeist. Im specifically thinking of Friendster to MySpace to Facebook to Instagram to TikTok the funnel has been Just point a camera at your face and go. Youre kind of back to Well actually writing is the ne plus ultra of the internet. We should just do a good job at it. I would argue that this has already happened but not quite in the way youve described it. ActivityPub is the protocol for exchanging information in the programmatic way. In a programmatic way an Instagram photo maps onto the same structures as a video on YouTube or a post on Twitter. You can map these concepts onto very generic concepts and add all the necessary metadata as extra on top. Now Mastodon is a product built on top of this protocol that focuses on short micro blogs on short posts with videos or images attached or polls where people follow each other. But there are already other fediverse projects that focus on different aspects of the social experience like Pixelfed which is focused entirely on photos. Its a photo app so it isnt really concerned with shortform blogging its just concerned with photos. You can follow a Pixelfed user from your Mastodon account and vice versa. Then in your home feed on Mastodon you get all these photos that people on Pixelfed post on Pixelfed you get all the photos that a Mastodon user posts. It maps back onto each other  maybe not always 100 percent and it doesnt have to. As you say its so versatile. It doesnt always make sense. If there is a new platform that does something very very unique that would have no way of mapping onto what Mastodon is doing today and they would not have to share any space. Then there might be another platform that is kind of similar to that one and they would be able to interoperate using those same semantics. Theres a variety of these platforms on the fediverse and Pixelfed and Mastodon are just some of them. Theres another one called PeerTube which is one where you have channels and you can publish longform videos on them. Again you can just follow a channel on PeerTube from your Mastodon account and get those videos in your home feed. You can leave comments and then those comments appear on the videos. A reply on something like Mastodon which could be compared to Twitter really maps well onto a comment on a video on YouTube. Do you think theres any danger of one of those platforms saying Weve hit the limit here. Were just going to fork the Mastodon code and build our own version of this thing with a separate network that might have its own network effects and then that becomes a challenge to Mastodon? Of course something like that could happen with the protocol. There is an XKCD comic for that. The punchline is that you now have one more standard to care about. Its a very famous comic yes. I kind of walked into this answer. I think what speaks in favor of ActivityPub and Mastodon is that we have built up this network. We have built up some momentum and some network effects for this protocol which means that its not really in anybodys interest to start completely from scratch. Of course it doesnt stop everyone. Theres Jack Dorseys pet project Bluesky in which they analyzed all the different decentralized social media projects and decided to come up with their own completely separate from everything that came before it again. That stuff happens all the time. Theyve succeeded in hiring one person after this project. After two years of deliberations theyve published something. Now its quiet again. Theres Nostr which I think is also Dorseys. Yes theres that. As far as I know its just full of spam and people talking about cryptocurrencies. Stuff like that pops up but ActivityPub is a very promising technology. No protocol is perfect and can never be perfect. Thats important to acknowledge because you will never be able to make an ActivityPub 2 that will not have some issue that somebody will find and say Okay now we need ActivityPub 3. Acknowledging that you might come around to the conclusion that Okay ActivityPub is here. A lot of people are using it. Well stick to it and make it better. You can make it better because its a technology that can be extended. There are these basic concepts basic semantics but if theres something that doesnt map onto those semantics you can progressively add them on top of it for new features and new concepts. Then other people that interoperate with you can decide Okay we want to display that information in our app as well so well start supporting that. I have wanted to ask this set of questions because Im very curious how it works and how you think about making it work. The technology and how you personally think about who might use it and why is all based on the central notion that one company should not be in charge of social networking. You should not have a Twitter a Facebook or even a YouTube that is in control of how we express ourselves online. I ask these questions because I never really hear people ask them. I only hear people ask about the next set of things which is content moderation. I feel like you cant quite understand the content moderation aspect of Mastodon without understanding the governance of the protocol  but now I have to talk about content moderation. The point of this as far as I can tell is that you dont think one person should be in charge of content moderation. Yes. So anybody can start a server and they can impose any rules they want. Some of those rules can be very strict and some of them can be very permissive. Theres no central place to impose rules from your perspective. Yes exactly. As you come to a place where Mastodon socially becomes the default do you feel any burden to change the content moderation rules for the default server? We havent identified any issues with the rules we have right now. For the most part our users are happy and our moderation load is bearable. We have a bunch of paid moderators working on our server and as it grows the moderation team will obviously expand further and further. In the sense of rules I think its quite fair to keep them as they are. They are on the safe side of the gradient between permissive and safe but not too restrictive. I think its a good balance weve stricken over the experience of seven years of running that server. This is the challenge though. Small communities are relatively selfsustaining and selfmoderating to an extent. As they scale things get out of control very quickly and people start doing very bad things very quickly. We have written about the challenges moderators face on skilled social platforms for years now. Is that a set of challenges youre facing? Are people doing the worst possible things with your service? Do you have automated tools? How does that work for you? I would say that were lucky enough that due to our smaller size we havent had to deal with the kind of horribleness that lets say Facebook moderators have to deal with. Honestly most of our reports are either just generic spam or people being mean to each other. Its not the horrible stuff that Facebook moderators need therapy for. In that sense weve been lucky. To answer your question on automation we have avoided it so far because we believe in the personal approach. What allows this personal approach is the decentralization and the different size constraints. First of all back in regards to the rules it is actually quite liberating in a sense to have this decentralized network. You can say Okay these are the rules of the service that we offer. If youre not okay with it thats fine. You can go somewhere else where what you want is allowed or you can just run it on your own. We dont have any obligation to allow you to post this or that if you can just do it yourself on your own money. I just want to point out that this hypothesis has never been tested if you give people a choice of moderation regimes they will pick one that offers the most safety and they wont pick one that has the horribleness because right now everything is so centralized. This is a largescale test to see if the marketbased version of content moderation actually succeeds in the way people have always said it would. Yeah. Going from that point back to moderation this decentralized system also allows sharing the load of the moderation burden between completely different systems and completely different organizations. If you count a person running a server as a moderator then the lower bound of the number of moderators in the fediverse is something like 9000 or 10000 because thats the number of servers there are. If you count a person running a server as a moderator  the fediverse has a much higher ratio of users to moderators than any other commercial social media platform. Of course for the singleperson servers out there it doesnt really matter. As I said theyre not really moderating theyre just running their own personal platform. But for all these communities if you have 20 people and one moderator thats a much higher ratio of users to moderators than on any other commercial social media platform. This decreases the moderation burden for everybody because for the most part people take care of the rulebreakers on their own servers and the other moderator doesnt have to deal with it. This leads to challenges because what you want is a megaphone right? If youre a writer on Medium when you write the thing and post it to the Medium Mastodon instance youre not trying to get to 20 other Medium writers. Youre hopefully trying to address millions of people who follow you across Mastodon instances. They all might have different rules. If you write about some hotbutton issue that breaks a bunch of rules you wont actually reach all those people. Those communities also have to moderate themselves. You kind of end up at a place where its harder to know what is going to happen because there are so many fragmented rules as opposed to Im just mad at YouTube all the time because YouTube is too opaque. Im wondering if you see a balance there that actually results in something different. Right now I think the frustration most people have is that they dont know whats going to happen. I would say that content moderation is one of the hardest problems in social media. Theres no denying that. We can add features we can remove features we can improve how a button looks whatever. Content moderation is always going to be at the core and center of what makes a social media platform work. So yeah it is complicated. But to counter your point if you publish something about some hotbutton issue that a lot of people will disagree with they might not see it even if you have a centralized service where everything is allowed. Because theyll block you theyll filter out the word or theyll use a block list that theyve made themselves and share around. That sort of thing is not unique to the fediverse and to the decentralized system of moderation. If for whatever reason you get blocked by a server of 20 people well thats part of it. Just imagine you were blocked by 20 people for writing that issue. Now Im not saying that everything is perfect. For example I think that there needs to be more transparency for users about what is happening with moderation on their servers. I dont think its great that your admin can make a decision to block another server and then suddenly you lose a bunch of followers without knowing about it. I think that we need to build some kind of notification system into it that will tell you Okay your admin has made the decision to block this server and youve lost this amount of followers. If you disagree with this heres what you can do. As long as you have that then people can again move to a better server or start their own. Nobody really suffers right? I agree with you. I think content moderation is the most complicated part of operating a social network. My thesis is that it is fundamentally the product. Any Mastodon instance is only distinguished from the next because it has slightly different content moderation rules or a slightly different community and that community might selfenforce those rules. What Im curious about is that moderation is the cost even beyond server costs or whatever. As your community scales moderation and legal compliance become a cost that is almost unbearable for anyone except the largest companies in the world. Facebook has to run moderation services across the world they have to be in legal compliance across the world. Right now as we speak there is a Supreme Court case about Section 230 and Googles recommendation algorithm on YouTube. I dont know how thats going to go. I can point to two specific Mastodon examples here. The Financial Times I think started a Mastodon instance and shut it down within days saying Okay just the legal compliance costs of running the server are too high for us. The other one which was much funnier than that was a Harry Potter server that shut itself down because there was an argument about Harry Potter and the community got out of control. There are a lot of arguments about Harry Potter. That community is just fully out of control right now. If I start a server and it gets moderately popular then suddenly as an administrator my costs in money time legal fees or whatever it is start to skyrocket in a nonlinear way to my user base my activity or my financial return. Is there a way for you at the protocol level or at the governance level to bring that back in line? Or is it Well someones going to have to figure out how to monetize this to make those costs work out? First to address the Financial Times I think they made the fundamental mistake of trying to run a public server instead of just running a server for their own journalists and people who work for them. The moderation load even the technical investment required is completely different for these models. Im not going to recommend everyone start a public Mastodon server and start accepting registrations from the public and get thousands and thousands of users because it is a huge responsibility. It is a responsibility that comes with a cost and potential liabilities. Its not easy. Mastodon is a shortcut to starting your own Twitter for the public if you want but it comes with all of the costs problems and risks of running a public service like that. Is it easy to start a social network from scratch? No it absolutely is not. Imagine starting something like Twitter completely from scratch. Mastodon is what allows you to do that if you want to. Its a shortcut to starting your own Twitter for the public if you want but it comes with all of the costs problems and risks of running a public service like that. Now if you just run it for yourself because youre an author a blogger a publisher or an enthusiast and you want to consume content from other people on your own terms its a completely different model. Youre not really liable for anything because its just for yourself. Youre not really risking much and it doesnt cost a lot. You dont need to think about moderating or hiring moderators. For the servers that do run publicly and accept registrations from the public yes moderation comes at a cost. Now of course as I mentioned before the cost of moderation and the burden of moderation is shared across the entire network. It is a lot lower than if a single company was doing it for millions and billions of users. If all you have to manage is a community of lets say 5000 people unless you have a lot of churn  which means you have a lot of new people joining all the time  for the most part the people on your server will be wellbehaved because the bad ones will already have broken the rules and be suspended. Can I push you on this? I believe the same thing that you believe but Im not the CEO of Mastodon. Do you have data that says that is actually true? I feel like that is the lived experience of being on the internet. If your community is small it will selfregulate but when it gets big it goes nuts. If Im making this bet I would want to know that thats true. I could provide you with anecdotal counterfactuals right? I could tell you to look at Reddit which is a history of small communities fracturing into rival subreddits and that will go on for infinity. So is this something that you believe? Is this something that you know? Is this something that you can measure? Well its based on my experience running mastodon.social and the moderation loads that we get. Most of the reports that come to us are usually about people who have just signed up and dont belong here. Theyre the people who dont actually agree with our rules and break them straight away. During times when we had closed registrations the load on our moderation team was a lot lower. For the most part its quite straightforward really. The people who break rules show themselves very quickly. They get banned and then theres nobody left to break the rules. I feel like people sometimes overestimate the amount of reports and the amount of moderation necessary that comes with a specific server size with a specific amount of users. Most people dont regularly break the rules. It is still a minority of people who do that and a minority of cases where it happens. It only increases when you have lots of new people coming in and possibly if you have a troll army that decides to make a bunch of accounts which can also make the numbers go up. Otherwise it has been quite manageable so far. As you look across the spectrum of Mastodon instances do you actually see a diversity of rules? Do you see that Theres a spectrum. We have the most permissive sites and the least permissive sites? There is a spectrum but I think for the most part the majority of the servers that run Mastodon today have agreed on a certain set of rules  probably because a lot of them have been inspired by mastodon.social and our rules originally. There is a lot of overlap. Some are a bit more restrictive about specific things like content warnings the kinds of selfpromotion you can do or whether you can run an account as a company or a brand versus as a natural person. Sometimes people do get restrictive with those sorts of things. Obviously there is a side to the fediverse that is completely the opposite and leans towards permissive everything goes free speech everything. For the most part it is ostracized and distanced from the previous side. A lot of different approaches exist out there. Are they growing in parallel? Is one growing faster than the other? How is that playing out? Well I believe that our part grows faster because they get traffic from joinmastodon.org our official website and our official apps. So that helps. Do you worry that the other side the most permissive libertarian side is going to say This is unfair you need to list our servers as a default as well? Well there is no real obligation for us to link to anybody. Sometimes yeah I get people that are very upset with me for not giving them a free link from our official website but were not really obligated to provide a link to anyone. We just do it to make the signup process easier for end users. Were only going to link to a place if we think that people are going to be safe there and have a good time. If your server is allowing everything and all types of language that is completely inappropriate then theyre not going to be safe there and were not going to send them there. So theres that. Eugen youve given us a ton of extra time. I want to say thank you. Im very excited to see where Mastodon goes. I did sign up over the weekend. Decoder listeners know I took a break from Twitterlike networks to heal my brain after 10 years but I signed up for mastodon.social. Im excited to use the product. I have two feature requests for you. One its slow. Can you make it faster? Yes I think so. That would normally not be a software problem but an infrastructure problem something specific to mastodon.social. Honestly depending on when you accessed it it could have been a DDoS attack because that happens. Just last night I was looking into a traffic spike seven times higher than usual that was causing a lot of errors to appear. So if youre complaining about slowness it could be that. I would be happy to report that we are upgrading our infrastructure completely from what we were using before. Our infrastructure for mastodon.social basically grew out from a single box originally in 2016. We moved providers  I say we but back then it was just me  quite a few times during these seven years. Im trying to remember where our original box was. Probably DigitalOcean actually. We tried using Scaleway and then we eventually moved to Hetzner the German hosting company which is where we are right now. Basically it grew out of a single box into a cluster of 15 or 20 different machines manually managed by me. Right now were upgrading to using Kubernetes and that simplifies a lot of the scaling significantly. Where before it would take half a day to set up a new machine now its like Okay its a couple clicks and a couple of keyboard button presses and now you have the capacity for a lot more traffic than you had before. With that plus having a DevOps person on the case it will hopefully improve the speed by a lot. My second feature request actually has me curious if you feel the pressure to look and feel more like Twitter now than you did before. Can you do quote tweets? I often want to quote tweet someone from The Verge and say This is great look at this. I know that youre opposed to it but are you starting to reconsider? We could do a whole episode about quote tweets if I start talking about it now describing the history and the positions people have on this feature. Ill keep myself short. We have a public roadmap on our website and quote posts are under the exploring section of that roadmap. The most complicated section of all. It means that were looking into it and hopefully well bring you quote posts. I like it. Whats next for Mastodon? What should people be on the lookout for next? Groups probably. Thats a big feature thats coming. Well its what you would expect. Facebook has groups Twitter has communities and Mastodon will have groups as well. Very good. Eugen thank you so much for being on Decoder. Well have to have you back soon. Thank you and have a good day.,Eugen Rochko is the CEO of Mastodon  the opensource decentralized competitor to Twitter.

The loss of these Soldiers will reverberate through our formations for years to come Maj. Gen. JP McGee commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault said in a statement on Friday. Now is the time for grieving and healing. The whole division and this community stand behind the families and friends of our fallen Soldiers. The medical evacuation helicopters were conducting a routine training mission when they crashed at approximately 1000 pm local time in an open field across from a residential area. All nine of the service members aboard the two aircraft were killed in the accident. Lt. Col. Anthony Hoefler a spokesman for the 101st Airborne Division told CNN that earlier reports that a total of four helicopters were taking part in the training exercise were incorrect. He said in a statement Saturday that there were only two aircraft involved in the training flight at the time of the accident. There were other aircraft in the airspace conducting different training flights at the time of the accident which is why multiple aircraft were able to respond quickly to the accident site. Its still unclear what caused the crash a team from Fort Rucker Alabama is currently onsite and investigating the incident the Army said Friday. The nine soldiers who were killed came from all different backgrounds. Barnes an aeromedical evacuation pilot enlisted in the Army from Florida in 2010 going on to deploy to Afghanistan with the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade according to service records provided by the Army. Bolanos a UH60 helicopter repairer and air crew member born in the Philippines enlisted out of Texas in 2019 and in 2020 served for nine months in Germany as part of Atlantic Resolve. A native Texan Esparza enlisted out of Missouri in 2010 and had served as an instructor pilot for the brigade since October 2021. Gayo also born in the Philippines joined the Army in 2019 out of California. Gore joined the Army in 2015 and had served as a flight paramedic for the brigade since May 2022. Healy had been serving as an Aeromedical Evacuation Pilot for the brigade since 2022 after having joined the Army in 2010. Mitchell enlisted in 2014 and was also serving as a flight paramedic for the brigade. Smith from Florida joined the Army in 2012 he served as an instructor pilot in the brigade and had deployed to Afghanistan twice in addition to a ninemonth rotation in Germany in support of Atlantic Resolve. Solinas a flight paramedic joined the service in 2018. Wednesdays accident was the deadliest aviation training incident since 2015 when 11 service members were killed when a Black Hawk crashed off the coast of Florida.

The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories one in Texas the other in Germany which opened last spring and a lag between that increased production and sales. Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models the Model S and Model X in transit to Europe the Middle East and Africa as well as to the Asia Pacific region. But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78000 more cars than it has sold suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers. That 78000vehicle excess production is equal to 5 of the cars it has built. First quarter sales trailed production by 18000 vehicles less than the gap in third and fourth quarter of last year but still equal to 4 of the vehicles it built. Early this year we had a price adjustment. After that we actually generated a huge demand more than we can produce really Tom Zhu Teslas executive in charge of global production and sales said at Teslas investor day. And as Elon said as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you dont have to worry about demand. But some analysts said the hard numbers reported Sunday raises questions about the strength of demand for Tesla no matter how bullish the comments from Zhu and Musk. If it wasnt clear before it now is Tesla has a demand problem Gordon Johnson an analyst who is one of the biggest Tesla critics said in a note Monday. For four straight quarters Tesla has produced more cars than they have sold despite the fact that two of its plants are operating at 20 to 40 utilization and it shutdown its largest plant unexpectedly three times in the first quarter said Johnson said who said he believes Musk has a pathological problem with the truth. In short no matter what Elon Musk says Tesla has a seriousmajor demand problem said Johnson. The company reported it completed sales of 422875 vehicles in the quarter. Thats short of the forecast of 430000 vehicles from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Dan Ives tech analyst for Wedbush Securities said the consensus that Wall Street was looking for was deliveries of 421500 which would mean a very narrow beat for Tesla. But even Ives a bull on Tesla stock said the lower prices that Tesla got for cars in the quarter will mean tighter profit margins going forward. Tesla will report full first quarter financial results on April 19. The big question will be margins as cutting prices will have an impact on this front he said in a note to clients Sunday. First quarter production was up only 0.2 from the final three months of 2022 despite it efforts to ramp up production in Germany and Texas. Production and sales were up much more when compared to the first quarter of 2022 with production up 44 and deliveries up 36. But even that suggests that Tesla is below the 50 annual growth target it has set for the company long term. Shares of Tesla TSLA which fell 65 in 2022 for its worst annual performance ever closed Friday up 68 so far in 2023. Still that left shares off 41 from where they stood at the end of 2021. Shares were down more than 5 in midday trading Monday on the sales report.,New York CNN  Tesla reported a modest 4 rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.

https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/we-all-know-tesla-leads-the-ev-sales-charts-hows-everyone-else-doing/,Other than Tesla which car companies are selling lots of EVs,As automakers report Q1 sales we take a look at the numbers,Enlarge With a starting price of 26500 its no surprise that Chevrolet has sold a lot of Bolt EVs this year 64 with As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been report 3104 chars,As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been reporting their sales numbers. Tesla which we covered on Monday is far and away the leader when it comes to electric vehicle sales in the US. But as more and more automakers are bringing new EVs to market Teslas market share is eroding from 72 percent at the beginning of last year to 54 percent nowand it may fall to less than 50 percent over the next few weeks. Which of those other automakers are managing to move metal? We took a look through the Q1 sales announcements to get an idea. While most automakers have published their Q1 2023 sales this is not a universal list. In particular Porsche MercedesBenz Lucid and Genesis have yet to reveal those numbers as of April 5. And the manufacturers dont all break out data in the same way either lumping all EVs together looking at you General Motors or grouping different powertrains together as is the case with the Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona. Its also helpful to remember that other than Tesla Rivian and Lucid all the other automakers have product lines other than battery EVs so such a company probably isnt going out of business next week because it only sold 3000 EVs in three months. Supply chains still arent back to what was considered normal prepandemic and its worth remembering that in most cases these are global products. There are severe penalties for automakers who dont sell enough EVs in Europe and China unlike here in the US. So in cases of finite supply those markets will receive priority when it comes to deliveriesevery EV you sell in the US is an EV you cant sell in Germany after all. Advertisement General Motors is best of the rest General Motors had a good Q1 this year selling more than 20000 EVs according to a press release that does not provide any more granularity to that figure. But a little digging reveals that the vast majority of these were Bolt EV and Bolt EUV sales with 19700 vehicles finding homes in the first three months of 2023. Thats up from 358 for Q1 2022 when the cars were taken off the market for some time due to a battery manufacturing defect. Cadillac has delivered almost a thousand Lyriq SUVs so far this year but the same cannot be said for the GMC Hummer EV. Thats due to a production issue that shut down production of the Hummer from last October until the end of January. The BrightDrop Zevo 600 delivery van was also affected by that recallstop sale but BrightDrop says it has started shipping the first 500 vans it built this year. Next up is Ford which sold 10866 battery EVs in Q1 an increase of 41 percent year on year. Just under half of those sales were of the F150 Lightning pickup truckFord says its on track to reach a production rate of 150000 Lightnings a year in 2023. The company hasnt given us a breakout of Mustang MachE and ETransit sales but it reported that ETransit sales were up 62.7 percent and that MachE sales were down reflecting downtime at the plant for changes to increase production.,As were now in the second quarter of the year automakers have been reporting their sales numbers.

While European parliamentarians disagree over the content and reach of the EU AI Act some regulators are finding that existing tools such as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR that gives users control over their personal information can apply to the rapidly emerging category of generative AI companies. Generative AI such as OpenAIs ChatGPT relies on algorithms to generate remarkably human responses to text queries based on analyzing large volumes of data some of which may be owned by internet users. The Italian agency also known as Garante accused Microsoft Corpbacked MSFT.O OpenAI of failing to check the age of ChatGPT users and the absence of any legal basis that justifies the massive collection and storage of personal data to train the chatbot. The points they raise are fundamental and show that GDPR does offer tools for the regulators to be involved and engaged into shaping the future of AI said Dessislava Savova partner at law firm Clifford Chance. Privacy regulators in France and Ireland have reached out to counterparts in Italy to find out more about the basis of the ban. Germany could follow in Italys footsteps by blocking ChatGPT over data security concerns the German commissioner for data protection told the Handelsblatt newspaper. We are following up with the Italian regulator said a spokesperson for Irelands Data Protection Commissioner. We will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities in relation to this matter. The privacy regulator in Sweden however said it had no plan to ban ChatGPT nor was it in contact with the Italian watchdog. Spains regulator said it had not received any complaint about ChatGPT but did not rule out a future investigation. Italys Garante like other privacy regulators is independent of the government and was also among the first to formally warn Chineseowned TikTok about breaching of existing European Union privacy rules. While the privacy commissioners favour more regulation the governments are more lenient. Italys deputy prime minister has criticized its own regulators decision by calling it excessive and a German government spokesman said a ban of ChatGPT would not be necessary. The Italian authoritys move last week was aimed at starting a dialogue with the company to address the issues raised over ChatGPTs compliance to EU data protection rules and not to ban the tool a source familiar with the matter said. OpenAI has not responded to regulators over the weekend the source said. Meanwhile OpenAI has taken ChatGPT offline in Italy on Friday. It did not respond to questions about other European regulators looking into potential violation in their countries. It has no offices in the European Union. OpenAI whose artificial intelligence platform took the world by storm after its launch in November said on Friday it actively works to reduce personal data in training its AI systems. The Italian investigation into OpenAI was launched after a ninehour cyber security breach last month led to people being shown excerpts of other users ChatGPT conversations and their financial information. Italy is the first Western country to take action against a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. While the Italian regulator has only singled out ChatGPT so far because of its popularity other AI platforms such as Google Incs GOOGL.O Bard might be questioned too several experts said. Unlike ChatGPT Google is more likely to have taken that into account already because of its history in Europe and because of the size of the organization Savova said.

Pascal Canfin a French centrist MEP who chairs the European parliaments environment committee said an EU law that all cars sold from 2035 must produce zero emissions will be voted unchanged including by Germany on Tuesday. Diplomats meeting on Monday approved the compromise agreed between Berlin and Brussels over the weekend which will allow some combustion engines if they fill up with socalled climate neutral efuels. Although Italy and Poland oppose the law and Bulgaria is abstaining it is expected to be approved by a majority of EU countries on Tuesday. The row blew up after Germanys Free Democratic party a member of the threeway governing coalition withdrew support from an EU plan to ban the sale of new cars powered by internal combustion from 2035 without stronger guarantees for efuels. After going back on a deal agreed between EU ministers and the European parliament last October the German government secured further concessions over the future use of efuels which are not yet commercially available. Germanys transport minister Volker Wissing said Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO 2 neutral fuels. The European Commission vicepresident Frans Timmermans tweeted that after the agreement with Germany the commission would follow up swiftly with the necessary legal steps to implement what had been agreed and get the regulation adopted as swiftly as possible. The dispute was a sign of growing tensions about the EUs green deal a set of laws intended to ensure Europe achieves net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Berlins Uturn on a done deal also triggered concerns among some countries of copycat behaviour that would undermine EU decisionmaking. The probusiness FDPs lastminute revolt reflected concerns in the powerful German car industry among companies that have specialised in manufacturing parts unique to combustion engines such as exhaust pipes. Efuels which can be made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen or the chemical or thermal treatment of biofuels or biomass are thought likely to remain scarce for years to come. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planets most important stories.

In January I received six penalty charge notices PCNs from Transport for London TfL each dated November 2022 through its agent Euro Parking Collection EPC. The fines for driving within Londons ultralow emission zone Ulez were 95.96 84.10 each if paid by the end of last November two months before they reached me. As Id missed the deadline they were 287.88 each. My car is a leased Volkswagen Passat GTE a petrolelectric hybrid and is Euro 6 compliant yet Im facing a 1727.28 bill. I tried repeatedly to challenge the fines but each time the TfL website returned an error message so I made an online representation to EPC but have been told by TfL the fines still stand. AL Braunschweig Germany The Ulez introduced in central London in 2019 and due to be expanded across Greater London in August requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily charge. However those from mainland Europe have been hit with fines amounting to thousands of euros despite driving compliant cars. Vehicles from overseas must be preregistered with TfL before entering the zone otherwise they may be deemed noncompliant. In 2022 167663 fines were sent overseas. Unluckily for you EPC which enforces them recently gained access to vehiclekeeper records in Germany the Netherlands and France and has been making up for lost time by firing off PCNs for alleged offences months previously. Amazingly there is no legal cutoff after which PCNs cannot be issued. By the time they reach drivers in your case via the leasing company which caused added delays they have rocketed for one couple to 3589 after a trip to London. TfL says the registration process for foreign vehicles is on its website but youd have to know of the requirement to look. It says overseas vehicles are deemed polluting by default if EPC is unable to confirm emission details from the relevant licensing authority. And it claims that if a driver can prove the vehicle is compliant it will cancel the PCN. Not in your case. You were informed there was no option to appeal since the fine was being enforced by EPC. Asked why payment deadlines are not extended for overseas drivers given postal delays TfL says it expects EPC to act reasonably. TfL cancelled the charges after I got in touch. It says It is clear the service the driver received was not good enough. EPC was contacted for a comment. Email your.problemsobserver.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

A couple of years ago it campaigned against proposals for a national speed limit on autobahns  a move that would have helped reduce Germanys CO 2 emissions. But as a coalition partner in Olaf Scholzs Social Democratled government it is taking environmental obstructionism to a new level. The FDP is the driving force behind German opposition to Brussels plans to ban sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035. Until this month the date was considered a done deal and constitutes a vital pillar of the EUs strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. But Germany is now insisting that the European Commission offers a getout clause allowing car manufacturers to carry on producing the engines if they can find a way to deliver carbonneutral efuels to run them. The highly technical nature of this debate risks obscuring its dangerous implications for Europes climate ambitions. In the context of economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine there are disturbing signs that the mood music on net zero targets is changing. Italys prime minister Giorgia Meloni has begun to talk darkly about the potential impact of the environmental push on the countrys economic fabric. Her deputy Matteo Salvini has described the timetable for transition to electric vehicles as economic and social suicide and a gift to China. The danger is that where Germany has selfinterestedly led regarding its own flagship industry other countries with their own preoccupations may follow. In the Netherlands the success of a profarmer party at recent elections has led to speculation that a pledge by The Hague to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 may not be met. EU plans to reduce emissions from intensive agriculture more generally have been scaled down. Other green goals on chemicals and biodiversity are being challenged. Climate laggards such as Poland and Hungary whose governments have barely paid lip service to the 2050 zero emissions target are doubtless scenting the possibility of fruitful alliances. Rather than risk a prolonged and damaging standoff with Berlin it seems likely that Brussels will offer some heavily caveated concessions on cars. But as Germanys exasperated Green vicechancellor Robert Habeck reportedly observed this week this standoff has meant that the largest ever piece of EU climateprotected legislation is starting to be undone. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that the threshold 1.5C target for global warming is almost certain to be breached in the 2030s this is a very bad look indeed. Europe given its wealth and its industrial history bears a special responsibility in the battle to contain global heating. Hard times have undoubtedly made the politics of fulfilling net zero pledges more difficult and handed an opportunity to the populist right in particular. But the response cannot be to delay and water down necessary action in the hope that Mr Micawberstyle some new technology turns up to solve the problem. As cold political winds begin to blow the pace and necessity of Europes green transition urgently need defending.,Germanys probusiness Free Democratic party FDP has long been an uncompromising defender of the biggest domestic car industry in Europe.

But when he joined the industry in the 1990s it was in the middle of a wave of change. Readily available car finance suddenly meant the public could buy more expensive cars. It changed the type of car people bought says Brownridge chief executive of BMW Group UK. Drivers could borrow to buy a pricier vehicle in the expectation that it would hold its value and could be sold on later. Britons couldnt get enough of it low interest rates helped and BMW rose to become the UKs fourthbiggest seller of cars despite the premium price tag of most of its models. And now the industry is facing an even bigger paradigm shift with the transition to electric cars in full swing and newer innovations such as connected and autonomous cars opening the door to different kinds of business. Things have changed a lot and are about to change significantly again says Brownridge standing in BMWs flagship showroom on Londons Park Lane. I genuinely think we are on the edge of probably the most exciting time in the industry. Brownridge is a UK car industry lifer. He was born in Oxford  close to the Mini factory which BMW now owns  but when he was small his family moved to Hong Kong so his engineer father could work on the citys mass transit system. Ive very fond memories of a very different culture Brownridge says. It was a very different world with the UK ruling the city state until the handover in 1997. When Chris Patten last governor of Hong Kong left on the royal yacht Britannia with the then Prince Charles it was quite a sad moment really. However his family was always tied to the UK and he returned for his secondary education. After university the car industry was the obvious choice. I am fascinated by anything with wheels he says. It felt very natural to start work with Land Rover then under the Rover Group which was in turn owned by BMW. He worked in managing customer relationships and data at Mini Rover and MG. Brownridge rose through the BMW ranks via marketing roles overseeing sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympics theres a replica Olympic torch in the corner of the room before taking charge of the Mini brand. He became UK chief executive in 2021 overseeing BMWs fourthlargest market after China the US and Germany. BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats Traditionally carmakers would sell cars to dealers and the dealers handled customer relationships but now manufacturers increasingly sell direct to consumers online. Dealers are highly sensitive about suggestions of a changing business model  under which carmakers take more control of the customer relationship  and Brownridge is wary of giving details of what BMW is considering. Our longterm strategy is to work with our network of retailers he says emphasising the with. However he acknowledges that how we transact is being examined. Thats something we need to work on with our partners rather than inflict on them he says. Because ultimately our success is mutual. Being more involved in the customer relationship will give carmakers more opportunities to make money throughout a vehicles life. Carmakers say they will also make their products more attractive. Customers are not always happy about being asked to pay more after purchase however. BMW suffered a flurry of incredulous news reports last autumn when it emerged that it was charging a 15 monthly fee to turn on heated seats. Brownridge says some of the coverage that focused on the hardware aspect was overlooking the obvious opportunity for software upgrades that can improve drivers experience. But the most eyecatching change to the car industry is the shift to electric technology. BMW made one in every 10 batterypowered cars sold in the UK in 2022 and a fifth of its UK sales were battery electric  already putting it on track to meet the governments mandate of 22 battery sales by 2024 which was confirmed last week after this interview took place. Carmakers will need to be selling 80 battery vehicles by 2030 and 100 by 2035. The government needs to ensure there is enough green energy to power electric cars and put more investment into the UKs charging network BMW has not always been on board with the UK governments plans. In 2020 it and other carmakers argued that a ban on internal combustion engines before 2040 would damage the British industry. Asked about that stance Brownridge says the UK governments plans are ambitious  not usually a compliment from executives  but achievable for BMW at least amid very strong demand for electric cars. Were ready he says. We have the products. So we are able to respond. However he adds that the government needs to ensure there is enough green energy available to power electric cars and must put more investment into the UKs charging network. Brownridge says car buyers focus on sustainability will only increase and will soon extend beyond the fuel powering their cars to how the cars are made. A focus on greener materials might give premium carmakers an edge as their higher margins can soak up new costs. But the BMW boss cites a company visit to a coalmine west of Cologne in Germany as evidence for why green manufacturing will become increasingly important to carmakers. The giant Hambach coalmine is bigger than central London in area and Brownridge says a giant machine there scoops out enough coal every day to cover a football field to a height of almost 100 metres. You look at that and think well this cant continue because therell be nothing left he says. Customer choice will be heavily influenced by their understanding of the same sustainability for the products. I think thats quite exciting.
