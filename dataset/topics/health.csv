The states laws it says require people who want to watch pornography to prove they are over 18. People seeking to access Pornhub are directed to a governmentlinked site where they can provide their ID. The move is the result of new laws designed to stop children from seeing explicit content. But it is just the beginningthe online ageverification industry is heating up. Since January three other states across the USMississippi Virginia and Utahhave copied Louisianas approach passing their own versions of ageverification laws. Another 11 states from Virginia to California have proposed laws that will require users to confirm their age before they can view pornography according to recent analysis. Some of these regulations are slated to take effect in the coming months. Its not just a US phenomenon either. Across the Western world efforts are underway to introduce more age checks online. Since 2020 regulators in Germany and France have pushed porn sites to check peoples ages and the UK and Australia are developing their own laws. These follow the introduction of more stringent safety rules that protect children online. The internet isnt a childfriendly place. However introducing age verification across the web is technical and complex. In 2019 the UK ditched a multiyear plan to introduce age checks after encountering myriad problems. The porn we watch is also highly sensitivekinks are incredibly personal and leaks of data online can be devastating. Privacy advocates porn companies and some regulators say the move to introduce age verification introduces significant problems. The concerns about young people accessing adult websites are real and widespread less widespread is the understanding of limitations of various ageverification tools and of the new dangers they might pose says Irina Raicu director of the Internet Ethics Program at Santa Clara Universitys Markkula Center. Many regulators and others seem to think of age verification as a solved problem technologists and privacy activists including activists focused on protecting children are trying to explain thats not the case. For years the only thing stopping people from accessing porn online has been small checkboxes Are you over 18? Yes or No? However legislation proposed around the world would add more robust checks. Dozens of online ageverification companies have cropped up with multiple ways to prove youre old enough to access sites. Your age can be confirmed by credit card details scans of your face or as is often proposed checks of government ID documents such as passports or drivers licenses. The checks can be carried out by thirdparty companies without sensitive information being passed directly to porn sites. One briefing from the European Commission details nine different methods of age verificationsome sophisticated some very low tech. A lot of stuff is being passed says Mike Stabile director of public affairs at the adult industry trade body the Free Speech Coalition. In terms of the actual implementation and how its going to workthats much more mysterious. The porn industry isnt against agechecking everyone who visits its websites Stabile says but some laws are vague and dont say how age verification should be implemented or whether all companies would be required to introduce the technology.,For the past three months anyone who lives in Louisiana and opens up Pornhub has been met with a new prompt.

Chief among them Beethoven had inherited genetic risk factors for liver diseases and was infected with hepatitis B taken alongside the composers alcohol consumption these likely contributed to his death at age 56. The teams research is published today in Current Biology. Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethovens health problems which famously include progressive hearing loss beginning in his mid to late20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818 said study coauthor Johannes Krause a biochemist specializing in ancient DNA at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany in a Cell Press release. Beethovenfamous for compositions like Bagatelle No. 25 popularly Fr Elise Sonata No. 14 Moonlight Sonata and Symphony No. 9is one of the most beloved figures in music history. Tens of thousands attended his funeral on March 29 1827. He was a talented pianist and had an intimidating work ethic when deafness beset him Beethoven put a resonator on his piano to amplify its sound and he eventually used vibrations to continue to compose. Though the researchers couldnt determine a certain cause of Beethovens deafness they gleaned numerous insights from his DNA. The genome was lifted from five preserved locks of wavy hair passed down through different families and friends. Several other locks of hair previously attributed to the composer turned out to not be his and onecalled the Kessler lockcould not definitively be attributed either way. Besides deafness Beethoven suffered from gastrointestinal issues gut pain and diarrhea and liver problems including two bouts of jaundice over the course of his life. The ailments became so severe that in 1802 he asked his favorite doctor Johann Adam Schmidt to describe and publicize the nature of his disease after his death. Schmidt ended up dying in 1809 18 years before Beethoven. Beethovens death is now generally attributed to cirrhosis or liver scarring. Based on the genomic data the team determined that celiac disease lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndromeall possible sources of gastrointestinal discomfort and erm violent excretionswere unlikely to have affected Beethoven. Furthermore Beethoven does not appear to have suffered lead poisoning previous analysis that suggested as much was based on a hair sample that did not belong to him. The composers death was almost certainly hastened by alcohol abuse. As noted by the researchers some of Beethovens contemporaries claimed that the composer drank in moderation but one friend allegedly claimed that in the last few years of his life Beethoven was drinking a liter of wine with lunch daily. There are metabolic biomarkers of chronic alcohol abuse that survive in hair particularly one called EtG wrote study lead author Tristan James Alexander Begg in an email to Gizmodo. Whether these biomarkers can be accurately analyzed with respect to chronic alcohol consumption in hair is a very big unknown and would likely entail a largescale study in order to validate such approaches explained Begg an archaeogeneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The team also compared Beethovens Y chromosome with five Y chromosomes from living descendants of Aert van Beethoven an ancestor of Ludwig who lived from 1535 to 1609. The team was able to reconstruct the Beethoven genetic patrilineage to about 1000 CE. But the Y chromosomes of the living men did not match those from the Beethoven hair samples to the researchers that indicated an extrapair paternitythat is an extramarital conceptionsomewhere between Aert van Beethoven and the birth of Ludwig seven generations later. That interloper provided the Y chromosome that eventually made its way into Ludwigs genetic code. Whether this means Beethoven himself was born from the extrapair paternity is undeterminable the researchers say. Similarly while the team was able to identity hepatitis B viral DNA in Beethovens hair they were not able to determine when or how the infection occurred. Hepatitis B causes inflammation of the liver and can be transmitted from mother to child through sexual interaction or during surgery with contaminated tools. We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk and an infection with hepatitis B virus Krause said. We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes. Hepatitis B is likely the most promising vein of future research Begg said. I would strongly advocate that additional locks of hair dating from different periods in Beethovens life undergo such analyses. While the results affirm some previously suspected conclusions they also raise new questions about the origins of Beethovens many illnesses. And of course perhaps the biggest mysterythe cause of his hearing lossremains just that.,Nearly 200 years after Ludwig van Beethoven died a team of researchers has managed to sequence the German composers genome from locks of his hair revealing surprising details of his health and genealogical history.

Four US troops at the coalition base near al Hasakah that was attacked on March 23 by a suspected Iranian drone and two service members at Mission Support Site Green Village attacked on March 24 have been identified as having brain injuries in screening since the attacks Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said Thursday. As standard procedure all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injuries he said. So these additional injuries were identified during postattack medical screenings. Those screenings are ongoing he added. One of the service members has been transferred to Baghdad for further treatment a US defense official familiar with the matter told CNN noting that Baghdad has more advanced treatment options and better specialists than remaining on base in Syria. The other five US service members who have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries are being treated at their facilities. The news comes a week after the suspected Iranian drone struck a facility housing US personnel killing an American contractor and wounding five service members. The US responded with precision air strikes on facilities associated with Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps which Ryder said Thursday killed eight militants. The US service members who were wounded in the attacks last week Ryder said all are in stable condition. Of the five injured in the original attack on March 23 one other service member is receiving treatment in Germany while two others and a contractor are being treated in Iraq and two have returned to duty. The service member who was injured in attacks on March 24 is also receiving medical care and is in stable condition Ryder said. In 2020 more than 100 service members were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries after an Iranian missile attack on the al Asad military base in Iraq. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said at the time that symptoms take time to manifest. Its not an immediate thing necessarily  some cases it is some cases its not he said. So we continue to screen. Mild traumatic brain injuries or concussion is one of the most common forms of TBI among service members. But TBIs can also be debilitating veterans described symptoms of dizziness confusion headaches and irritability after sustaining TBIs as well as changes in personality and balance issues. On Thursday Ryder reiterated US officials remarks last week that the US will take all necessary measures to defend our troops and our interests overseas. We do not seek conflict with Iran he said but we will always protect our people.

The decision to change clothing rules around swimming in the German capital was made after two women including Mies filed complaints about being thrown out or barred from the citys pools for refusing to cover up and demanded the same rights as their male counterparts when bathing obenohne topless at the citys public pools. Berlin resident Mies 33 filed a discrimination complaint last December against a Kaulsdorf indoor pool after she was barred from entering topless. The 33yearold said she emailed in advance and was given permission to bathe topless. However when Mies went topless at the pool staff asked her to leave. Mies said she protested that the rules only prescribe wearing commercial bathing suits and that she was allowed but police were summoned and the lifeguard who originally gave her the green light barred Mies from the pool. A correct interpretation of the bathing rules  Lotte Mies at Kaulsdorf pool in Berlin. Photograph Gerald Matzkadpa Mies described feeling humiliated as she left and contacted the citys department for justice diversity and antidiscrimination. Her complaint prompted a rule change after the department found that Mies had correctly interpreted the bathing rules and the decision was made to explicitly add that anyone regardless of gender could be topless at the public pools. I felt very humiliated and that my dignity as a human being was discriminated against because I am a woman so that certain things and premises were denied to me due to unwritten moral codes that men imposed on women that are still in effect today Mies told the Guardian. It is important to understand that not allowing people the same rights because of their gender is not a matter of opinion but an act of structural sexism. Everyone should have the same opportunity and above all freedom of choice especially when it comes to their own body Mies continued. The German capitals authorities made clear that the existing rule which insists that bathing costumes cover the genitals applies to all visitors and that anyone can choose whether to wear a full swimsuit or just bottoms at the pools. Now it has been laid down that this regulation is always applied in accordance with the principle of equal treatment of all genders. There are no longer different ways of interpreting the common practice but every guest of our swimming pools now has the possibility to decide for themselves which kind of swimwear they want to wear Berlins swimming pool operator Berliner Bderbetriebe said. The move follows a similar incident in Berlin in 2021 in which a French woman living in the city Gabrielle Lebreton was ordered to leave a water park when she refused to cover up her breasts while sunbathing. It sparked a no nipple is free until all nipples are free protest where women rode bikes topless and men wore bras to demonstrate against the double standard. Mies celebrated the rule change but said there was still a lot to be done to secure equal rights for all genders. The main problem with the whole topic is that women are exposed to permanent sexualisation and this is equated with sexual availability and they are treated accordingly. This is the real scandal. We as a society must counteract this socialisation and stop treating women as objects and start respecting them she added. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration featured trips and local tips for your next break as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Privacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

For more than a century Germany has practised Freikrperkultur FKK which translates as free body culture. Arnd Bauerkmper associate professor of modern history at the Free University of Berlin told the BBC that at the turn of the 20th century nudism was part of a movement to be closer to nature. Bauerkmper said that for Germans living in communist East Germany FKK functioned in part as a safety valve  a way to release tension in a restrictive state by providing an opportunity for some free movement. Berliner Bderbetriebe said it welcomed tourists to the city and its public pools and asked guests to practise mutual respect and tolerance when visiting. Veteran German leftwing politician Gregor Gysi spoke out a few years ago about his disappointment in the decline of FKK saying it was the pornographic gaze of westerners after reunification that destroyed the pleasure of nude bathing. He called on local German governments to do more to protect FKK areas of beaches and spas. Berlin is not the only German city to allow topless swimming. In May 2022 Gttingen in Lower Saxony central Germany became the first German city to allow female topless swimming in its indoor and outdoor pools after a swimmer who identified as male was turned away from a public pool for wanting to swim with their chest bare. Following a brief test phase the regulation is now being continued permanently.,When a lifeguard asked police to remove Lotte Mies for bathing topless at her local indoor swimming pool in Berlin it was a move that would inadvertently trigger a rule change allowing all women including visiting female tourists the freedom to go topless while swimming in the city.

This is why 3 April. There is certainly far too much singleuse rubbish created and manufacturers should be incentivised to produce less. Since they are motivated to seek the cheapest option eg disposable versus returnable bottles it is up to the government to create economic rules that favour reduce reuse recycle. It should also review how disposal is funded. Costs are incurred when following the proper disposal route and these can be considerable. This provides an incentive to flytip and discourages the provision of bins the owneroperator has to pay. Litter clearing is the other side of the coin. Public bodies both local and national need to give greater priority to this  look at the state of roadsides. The money for this has to come from somewhere and in principle should be raised when items are made and sold. Where I disagree with the author is in exculpating litterers. The decision to drop litter whatever ones circumstances is a personal choice littering is not confined to those who are hardup. The common characteristic of wilful litterers rich or poor is selfishness  my convenience grievance or whatever is all that matters. However I agree that merely ranting against litter is unproductive and if one doesnt like to see it then one should get out there and help pick it up I do. More power to Taheri for doing that. Peter Janes West Harptree Somerset I read with interest Leila Taheris article about how much to blame those who litter. I help local litter volunteers and the amount of rubbish chucked out of car windows into the hedges and verges along my local lane is truly atrocious. The vast majority of the rubbish is made up of discarded glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans. When I lived in Germany I never saw this kind of litter anywhere and there was a good simple reason. Germany has had an excellent deposit return scheme DRS and recycling system for over 25 years. All supermarkets have machines that take glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans in return for a voucher that you redeem at the till. Even if somebody throws one of these items into a hedge it wouldnt be there for long because every kid knows its worth 25 cents. Environmental groups in Britain campaigned hard for two decades for something similar here but the current government dragged its feet because it is in the pocket of the big drinks companies and supermarkets. In 2019 it finally announced that a DRS would go ahead it then took two years for a consultation then another two years to hear the outcome. Now we hear that it wont be introduced until after the next election  and it wont even include glass bottles. All those who voted for the present government should admit their share of blame for the dismal state of our country. Edmund Wood Gillingham Dorset I organise our village litter pick and we are invariably disheartened by the amount of rubbish we find and do get angry about it so when I read Leila Taheris article I thought it was the Guardians April fools joke two days late. So when I see a delivery bloke chucking his can out of his van window I shouldnt think him a lazy inconsiderate slob he is just feeling alienated disconnected and excluded. Colin McRae Great Dunmow Essex Leila Taheris article was infuriating. How patronising to suggest that people shouldnt be expected to use a bin because of society. Litterers disgrace themselves and this planet and they are a very very long way down my list of people to feel sorry for. Im sure the heron that choked to death would agree.

Only governments can guarantee these rights. Adopting a cash first approach to food insecurity is vital to ensure people can access income before charity but equally vital is the prioritisation of systemic changes to truly tackle poverty and inequality. It comes after the UKs leading poverty charities said the basic benefits given to lowincome households are at least 140 a month below the real cost of food energy and everyday basics. Research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the food bank network the Trussell Trust said inadequate benefits were the main driver of the big rise in destitution. They urged the government to formally bring universal credit rates into line with minimum living costs. There have been plans from international organisations to expand the model into new countries.
