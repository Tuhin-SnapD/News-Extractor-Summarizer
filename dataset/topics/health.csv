disappeared into the mouth of the 7615 chars,Theres a litre of water plus big bottles of shampoo sun lotion and mouthwash sloshing around next to the clothes and laptop in my green wheelie case which has just disappeared into the mouth of the scanner at London City airport I had even recklessly bunged in my makeup bag After years of being conditioned to travel with micro toiletries my heart is beating faster Im waiting for a klaxon to go off and my unholy trinity of familysize Pantene Soltan and Listerine plus assorted cosmetics to be unceremoniously dumped in one of the sin bins that have been stationed by security lanes since the mid2000s But Nothing Happens Apart from some raised eyebrows at the vat of mouthwash The east London hub has from Tuesday officially become the first mainstream UK airport to end the tyranny of tiny toiletries that has held sway since 2006 when the 100ml limit on liquids pastes and gels in hand baggage was first introduced after a foiled transatlantic bomb plot to use explosive liquids disguised as soft drinks Now passengers flying out of the Docklands airport can carry liquids and gels in containers of up to 2 litres in their hand baggage after it upgraded its baggage screening system to the latest CT computed tomography scanners which provide a 3D image of the contents of passengers bag The technology also works for electronics meaning the slow process of depositing belongings on to multiple trays has gone Instead security staff cheerfully tell passengers to leave everything inside your bags  enabling people to file through at a much faster rate City announced the planned changeover last year beginning with a trial security lane before gradually switching the rest over With all four now upgraded the airport claims to have Londons fastest security experience Waiting for her morning flight to Ibiza Lynne Schey has just breezed through It was gorgeous a morning present I asked for a plastic bag to put things in but they said I didnt need one Phenomenal Like the rest of us Schey had got used to the strict rules with travellers all part of the same army carrying their makeup and medicines in a little plastic bag for all to see You started being more discerning with no makeup and lots of little containers with little bits of this and that in she says Occasionally you would forget though and cause a pile up with a bottle of water Sisters Laura and Ruth Stephenson were amazed how quickly they had got through security Photograph Graeme RobertsonThe Guardian Its the end of miniature toiletries agrees Alison FitzGerald the airports chief operating officer The longrunning restrictions resulted in a very tense environment in the security area It makes it really stressful Youve got to get all this stuff out of your bag and feel under pressure to be quick People were also upset at being made to throw away expensive items such as perfume or face cream Staff were always saying you cant take that you cant do that FitzGerald says but now the conversations are more positive With the new scanners able to process up to 550 trays an hour each lane passengers are moving through the airport more quickly We are getting 30 more passengers through an hour says FitzGerald Its much less stressful from a passenger point of view The information thats provided to the security officer is much more enhanced so the threat detection has improved significantly With nearly 4 million passengers expected to pass through this year London City is the first major UK airport to be able to fully relax the liquid rule Smaller rival Teesside International dropped it in March after it replaced its two scanners Trials are under way at other airports including Heathrow However other hubs stressed that for now current restrictions remain in place and passengers must still remove tablets laptops and liquids from their cabin baggage with the usual 100ml limit and plastic bag rules At peak travel times like this weekends Easter getaway travellers are greeted with bins overflowing with bottles of water and outsized toiletries from those who forgot the rules perhaps because Covid stopped them from travelling for so long In the UK the government has set a deadline of June 2024 for large airports to install the new screening equipment spelling the eventual end to the 100ml rule To date Australia and the Netherlands are the only other countries to have mandated the upgrade although trials are taking place around the world skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily

period of confusion for travellers who may encounter different security regimes on the flight out and on the way home says Nicky Kelvin head of travel advice website The Points Guy Anybody traveling with hand baggage will need to check what the current trial or rule is for the place they are travelling from and to he says If you are a transit passenger you will need to be even more careful Of course you can still check a bag in if you need to but its expensive Sisters Laura and Ruth Stephenson are eating breakfast in the City departure lounge waiting for their flight to Florence to be called Laura says she was amazed how quickly they had got through security Ruth used to travel with a massive bag of makeup and skincare but is more restrained these days The world may be changing again but for this trip anyway her beauty essentials still fit into the smallest bag known to man she says waving an airport issue plastic bag that is barely a quarter full During the pandemic hand sanitiser shot to the top of the list of confiscated items Weirdly Marmite and snow globes are a big problem too says FitzGerald Marmite counts as a paste under the liquid regulations while snow globes are not marked with a volume measure We always had to confiscate them even if they were small she says Both the old and new generation of scanners use Xray imaging but the camera in the older machines is stationary resulting in a 2D image whereas in a CT scanner it spins It takes a number of photos in a very short amount of time of your cabin baggage so we can create a 3D image but also do a bunch of detection to look for bad things says Jonathan Stone aviation solutions division manager at the US firm Leidos which supplied the new scanners at London City The new machines also put detection capability into the hands of algorithms and science as opposed to relying solely on humans The new scanners come at a price with an estimated 10000 to 15000 scanners to replace globally at a cost of about 200000 a machine However the investment should be recouped through higher takings in airport shops and lower staffing costs as the new systems require fewer security workers to monitor the equipment and herd passengers Its making the traveling public much safer number one and number two offering our airport customers the ability to modernise and optimise their security operations says Stone There will be a return on that investment as passengers spend more on duty free and less time in line for security For me there was no Ibiza or Florence It was just a dummy run However it did provide a salutary reminder of why leaving liquids at home can be no bad thing something blue leaked all over my clothes,health

unexpected open sesame in the form of Dr Jonathan Kennedy the director of the MSc and iBSc global public health programmes at Barts and the London Medical School and while he has his photograph taken up on one of its mezzanine floors Im free to wander around alone At least I think Im alone the museum is nothing if not ghostly On the same site as the hospital in the City of London this purposebuilt glassroofed Victorian building is home to about 4000 medical specimens the majority of them displayed on open shelves Every part of the body is represented and every kind of illness and injury  though tracking down a particular condition can be tricky for the nonmedical When I finally find the gnarled yellow spine of a patient who suffered from tuberculosis  I was after something that speaks to Kennedys new book which is about infectious disease and its effect on human civilisation  its largely down to luck The vertebrae in question just happen to be next to the museums most famous exhibit the skull of John Bellingham who assassinated the British prime minister Spencer Perceval in 1812 In Pathogenesis How Germs Made History there is no mention of Perceval But Bellinghams skull preserved after the dissection of his body that followed his hanging inevitably brings to mind Kennedys chapter on the Industrial Revolution  a period when previously uncommon pathogens such as TB and cholera began to thrive in our cities cholera did not appear in Europe until the 1830s having hitched a lift in both the guts and the linen of travellers from southeast Asia Not only did infectious diseases then account for 55 of deaths in London cholera epidemics in particular also led to a rise in the publics distrust of doctors who were sometimes attacked as they transported suspected sufferers to hospital for isolation The skull of John Bellingham the man who killed PM Spencer Perceval in 1812 a period when uncommon pathogens began to thrive in the UKs cities Photograph St Bart Pathology Museum Murderers bodies were sent for dissection by law as Bellinghams had been the medical profession was hungry for cadavers and this ensured a supply line However as Kennedy notes the 1828 murders committed by William Burke and William Hare who sold their victims bodies to Edinburgh Universitys medical school caused people to believe that cholera patients removed from their communities by doctors were about to be similarly dispatched The anatomists of course were absolutely right to compel isolation but most of their patients would indeed die even if they didnt kill them personally So far as treatments went doctors were clueless One of their more bizarre cures involved injecting turpentine and mutton stew into the patients intestines via the anus Kennedys book which aims to show how infectious disease has shaped us from the time of the Neanderthals to the era of Covid19 is full of amazing facts like these For days after I read it I kept thinking of Pope Clement VI who when the Black Death reached 14thcentury Avignon where he was exiled retired on the advice of his physician to his chamber seeing nobody and spending all day and all night between two great fires  the flames of which kept the rats that were carrying the disease at bay Clement did very well to survive Its estimated that somewhere in the region of 60 of the population of Europe about 50 million out of 80 million people died from the plague between 1346 and 1353 Meanwhile the economy more or less ground to a halt Kennedy is a sociologist who somehow ended up  he describes a meandering intellectual journey  in public health Before coronavirus I published a paper looking at the links between populism and vaccine confidence he says So when the outbreak started the rational thing to do as an academic might have been to get my hands dirty working on Covid19 But actually I struggled with the way my work was suddenly the news and so I went in a slightly different direction With Pathogenesis I wanted to broaden the discussion out In the pandemic most experts stopped saying this is an aberration pretty early on for the simple reason that if you look back you can see that it really isnt exceptional Over the course of human history it has been normal to have these pandemics that not only kill a lot of people and bring civilisations crashing down but which also sometimes create space for new kinds of societies to emerge The book is an intellectual response to the slightly myopic way some people viewed the pandemic Its a long view one that we couldnt perhaps take at the time because everyone was in such a panic Its hard to overstate the role that infectious diseases played in the foundation of the Spanish empire Pathogenesis doesnt only cover thousands of years of history  it seeks radically to alter the way the reader views many of the often very wellknown events it describes Having read recent research by scientists archaeologists and anthropologists for instance Kennedy suggests that Homo sapiens became the dominant species of human not as a result of any inherent intellectual superiority over Neanderthals but because our immune system was better suited to adapting to pathogens as we migrated north from Africa He also looks at the role disease played in colonisers ability or not to govern their empires Its generally accepted that Rome fell partly because of plague probably smallpox its armies weakened by illness But by his telling had it not been for an Ebolalike pandemic in the second century Christianity would never have become so widespread  a slightly more surprising analysis What part he asks did pathogens play in the nearmiraculous victories of conquistadors such as Hernn Corts and Francisco Pizarro in Central and South America in the early 16th century Kennedy as you will have gathered doesnt believe in the socalled great man theory of history He believes in the sick man theory of history for no soldier can march if he is dying and no king can rule who is weakened by infection With this book he set himself a mammoth task Where on earth did he start Well I guess my starting point was microbes he tells me were in a seminar room now far away from all the pickled lungs and hearts Within us there are 40 trillion bacteria Theyve evolved over millions of years and we now know theyre playing all sorts of roles in our lives This blows my mind and the question I wanted to ask as a sociologist was if these tiny things have such an influence on our bodies what kind of effect might they have on the body politic the body social the body economic Humans make history but not in circumstances of their own choosing Microbes are a huge force in creating those circumstances Ebola is just one of the many threats that humanity has faced in recent years Photograph Frederick MurphyAP Together we roam haphazardly over some of the history in his book I want to know what he found most mindboggling One thing that really came out of the whole project was the absolute baselessness of white ideology he says Obviously that comes to the fore when were discussing colonialism It seems bizarre to me now that people would put down Pizarros conquering of the Inca empire with only 168 troops to the fact that he had superior weapons Its hard to overstate the role that infectious diseases played in the foundation of the Spanish empire The Spanish brought smallpox with them among other diseases which devastated the Indigenous population This was followed by measles an infection now thought to have been similar to salmonella and flu Local populations fell by 90 The Spanish invaders interpreted all this as a sign that God supported them Yet we cling to assumptions about superiority Ever since we discovered the Neanderthals were a separate species we have dehumanised them seeing them as these brutish cave men Kennedy goes on But it seems like they were just as smart as us They could talk they created cave art They buried their dead and observed rituals To realise that Homo sapiens were migrating out of a tropical region and that they were carrying more microbes and that the Neanderthals further north struggled to deal with those its a neat reflection of the arguments about colonialism Children suffering from TB rest outdoors at Springwell House London in the 1930s The benefits of fresh air were then thought to combat the disease Photograph Fox PhotosGetty Images In the context of our own times Neanderthal man is particularly interesting to him We now know that Homo sapiens and Neanderthals interbred with the result that we carry their genes The Neanderthal genome has moreover been sequenced by Prof Svante Pbo the winner of the 2022 Nobel prize for physiology and papers published since have shown that Neanderthal gene variants in the contemporary population have had an impact on responses to Covid those carrying one such variant were 22 less likely to end up in intensive care compared with infected people of the same age Its crazy to think that something that happened 60000 years ago impacts on whether or not we have a really terrible reaction to Covid says Kennedy But if he is fascinated by the past hes also concerned about the future Were living in a golden age for microbes Population densities are increasing people are moving more quickly around the world the climate is changing Weve seen the emergence not just of Covid but of HIVAids Zika Dengue fever Sars and Ebola It seems now that we wont be able to conquer infectious diseases Rather were going to have to learn to deal with the new diseases that periodically arrive to threaten us If history teaches us anything he believes its that things will only change in terms of health if we stick together These are global societal issues If one rich country tries to save itself itll still be doomed Has writing Pathogenesis made him feel pessimistic On balance it hasnt While antibiotics may soon cease to be effective in treating some illnesses a prospect he finds frightening and hard to fathom in the future microbes may themselves provide the solution Viruses might be the new antibiotics They kill about half the bacteria in the world every day Its about finding the right one to target the right bacteria He thinks of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek the 17thcentury Delft haberdasher who pioneered the microscope No more pleasant sight has ever come before my eyes wrote Van Leeuwenhoek enraptured by the teeming new world he saw beneath his lens There is Kennedy says still so much to discover Were incredibly vulnerable as a species but were also incredibly ingenious A hundred and fifty years ago we didnt even know that microbes cause infectious diseases Now were analysing Neanderthal DNA This article was amended on 2 April 2023 to correct a mistranscription Dr Jonathan Kennedy spoke about the interbreeding of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals as something that happened 60000 years ago not 6000 years ago as an earlier version said,health

young man outside urinating against the glass front door The man was too drunk to notice Paul standing there so Paul had to wait in the lobby until the man had finished Living in an area surrounded by pubs and bars means dealing with public urination  and worse  is something he has grown used to It becomes normalised he says But that doesnt mean its right His family are from Soho and he says a lot of visitors arent aware there is a community who live there When people realise and are apologetic he doesnt mind so much  it feels thoughtless rather than disrespectful Its far worse he says when you get people who are just belligerent or rude Public toileting  or wild toileting as it has been called like an antisocial version of wild swimming  has been a growing concern particularly since Covid closed public loos many never to reopen That comes on top of a longerterm decline in public facilities  Raymond Martin managing director of the British Toilet Association estimates we have lost 50 of public toilets in the past 10 years Meanwhile cashstrapped councils streetcleaning budgets have been under pressure as costs of cleaning particularly during the pandemic have risen And according to a report by the Association for Public Service Excellence public satisfaction at cleaning is at its lowest in five years Martin had a meeting last year he says with the London assembly part of the Greater London Authority to try to get more public loos built or reopened Street urination is everywhere now he says because toilets were closed so people were being forced to go wherever they needed to go  alleyways street corners whatever Now youve got this smell and staining on the streets Thats just urination never mind the defecation side of things Its a major problem In recent years many politicians have called for a renewed focus on public toilets with limited success This year Labour London assembly members rejected an amendment tabled by the Green party that proposed spending 20m on new toilets at underground stations An increasingly rare sight  a functioning public toilet Photograph George ClerkGetty ImagesiStockphoto Perhaps we grew more accustomed to wild toileting during the pandemic  sales of Shewees for instance the device that allows women to stand while peeing and therefore pee where men pee have boomed 700 since the first lockdown  and it has taken us a while to return to normal standards It has always been a problem when large numbers of people descend on a place such as the visitors to Cheltenham races last month For 51 weeks of the year in Cheltenham no one would urinate against a wall in public at 1030 in the morning says Max Wilkinson a Cheltenham borough councillor During race week it seems to be something that happens and local people shouldnt be expected to turn a blind eye to it or accept it Its totally disgusting and it shows a lack of respect for our town Residents complain of men urinating in their front gardens and businesses report streams of urine in doorways and down walls It is a very small minority who do this but the impact on the local area is quite profound says Wilkinson People who are going for a wee in what they think is a quiet spot will get a bit of splashback on to their trousers and shoes This year Wilkinson declared as he calls it the War on Wee Public urination has always happened in the town during the races but he says its become more noticeable in recent years and thats despite the fact that more temporary loos have been put in One measure the council tried this year was hydrophobic waterrepellent paint on walls so when people go for a wee in what they think is a quiet spot or up against a wall somewhere in the town centre they will get a bit of splashback on to their trousers and shoes We did a social media campaign and there were posters all around town letting people know that its not acceptable Wilkinson says no fines were handed out in 2022 even though there were numerous complaints from residents and photographs posted on social media of men urinating on streets and in parks Making a dash for it  a race on Gold Cup day at Cheltenham last month Photograph Sam MellishGetty Images He has witnessed it himself I saw a group of blokes walking past the postal sorting office which isnt a long way from the town centre There were cars in stationary traffic less than 20 yards away they took one look at each other and decided to go for a wee against the wall This was in the morning Its disgusting and its got to stop Police said they were cautiously optimistic that antisocial behaviour had reduced in Cheltenham this year including complaints about public urination In Soho in central London residents have reported people peeing through their letterboxes says Tim Lord chair of the Soho Society On one of the worstaffected streets residents of one block reported that in the summer in particular people were urinating all along into the doorways of those flats on the ground floor Their kids saw mens genitals it was appalling The whole of Soho in the summer smells of urine and has done for three or four years Business rates of 200m are raised in the area he says much of that is from pubs and bars If youve got an area which is incredibly economically productive some of the money that generates should be spent to mitigate the problems its likely to cause  it always used to be and now isnt That seems to be fundamentally wrong Lord has lived in the area for more than 30 years For many years we had two quite large underground public toilets he says He lived near one of them It always used to be open from 10am till 2am and was quite well run quite clean About 10 or 15 years ago I noticed that they werent looking after it and it was closing earlier I thought that doesnt make sense Soho has a lot of alcohol licences about 400 in a quarter of a square mile Good public toilets he says are really an important part of Sohos ability to function Its not just the drinkers  many of whom will be tourists bringing money to the area  using them but market traders and homeless people Its another humiliation for the homeless people that theres nowhere they can go Both public toilets closed during the pandemic and didnt reopen though there are plans to refurbish one of them We now have very ugly temporary toilets which cost 15000 every weekend from Thursday says Lord The council have also introduced hydrophobic paint along with posters pleading with people not to urinate on the street There is an acknowledgement that theres a problem says Lord but then theyre still closing one of the large underground public toilets There appears to be no medium to longterm sensible plan The temporary toilets have decreased the level of public toileting he says but theyre pretty ugly We ask the council is that the plan for ever And theres no answer to that question Lord is sceptical about what he describes as the pee paint  would drunk people notice or care about their urine being splashed back on to them he wonders You could be fined under the Public Order Act if you are caught urinating in public or even punished for indecent exposure Other towns and cities have tried different measures Public openair GreenPee urinals that double as planters have been installed in Amsterdam and in Belgian cities In the GreenPee urinalcumplanter urine is absorbed by hemp  a single urinal can cope with up to 300 toilet visits It is taken away for composting and can later be used to fertilise public parks Paris home of the pissoir now has the Uritrottoir an eco urinal installed in areas of high public urination which also harvests urine for compost Lyon has considered women and trialled composting sitdown urinals not only did they save water compared with flushing toilets but the deputy mayor said that in the trial of 16 units 35000 litres of urine had been collected to use as fertiliser in less than three months And last year officials in Boston in the US decided to trial sensors in lifts on the transport system that would alert cleaning crews to the presence of urine In England and Wales the law is technically on the side of the War on Wee You could be fined under the Public Order Act if you are caught urinating in public or even punished for indecent exposure under the Sexual Offences Act of 2003 should you be found guilty of exposing your genitals and intending to cause alarm or distress In Scotland where public urination comes under the Civic Government Act police recorded 1222 urination offences in 2021 Nowhere to go  derelict public toilets in north London Photograph Gary Colet PhotographyGetty Images But unless a police officer happens to be passing the vast majority of public urination instances are not reported Max Wilkinson points out that he reviews social media for complaints from local residents because thats now a popular way for people to report it Social media users have even shared video doorbell footage of people urinating in front gardens in a bid to publicly shame individuals Some have complained to parcel or food delivery companies that their employees have been caught urinating on their property though this is more likely because of a lack of proper breaks and access to facilities rather than disrespect or lax hygiene Apart from being unpleasant wild toileting comes with more serious implications As Wilkinson says witnessing someone relieving themselves in public can feel threatening to a lot of women and to men too Urine can erode buildings and create pollution While the ecological impact of public toileting in towns and cities remains understudied its reasonable to believe it may have a detrimental effect on nearby waterways Dr Christian Dunn senior lecturer in natural sciences at Bangor University led a study to measure the presence of drugs in the nearby river during and after Glastonbury festival and found cocaine levels high enough to potentially harm wildlife downstream  contamination caused by public toileting The problem with chemicals in urine entering our rivers is that they help create a cocktail of drugs in our waters  and we have very little knowledge of what the effects of this everchanging mix are on aquatic wildlife ecosystems and ultimately our own health Dunn says We can research the effects of one particular chemical such as cocaine on one species like eels but the situation in our rivers is much more complex  there are many chemicals and compounds reacting with entire ecosystems with short and potentially longterm effects Wetlands he says can help mitigate these risks Existing between rivers and land they act as ecological kidneys says Dunn and could help filter out harmful chemicals but these have been decimated over the centuries as weve strived to use every bit of land in the UK for building or farming We should be looking to reestablish these wetlands along all our rivers  in the countryside and even our cities And then there are hygiene issues The pandemic reminded us of the importance of cleanliness says Martin of the British Toilet Association but we are not creating the infrastructure to support it Weve got to get our hygiene levels back up to not only where they were but way beyond that That means things like flushing toilets rather than urinating in the street and people being able to wash their hands Epidemics fuelled the rise of public toilets in the first place says Lee Jackson historian and author of Dirty Old London The Victorian Fight Against Filth The Victorians were the first people to try to deal with public urination They did that off the back of the cholera epidemics of 1832 and 1848 where anything that seemed insanitary had the worry that it brought contagious disease he says Measures such as commit no nuisance signs builtin deflectors on temptingly discreet walls of buildings and castiron urinals  many incredibly ornate  started to appear on streets few of the urinals survive in London but Jackson says Birmingham is a good place to spot them Public toilets for women didnt really come in until the late 1880s says Jackson Conveniences were part of that late Victorian thing of municipal socialism  public libraries baths and toilets  this idea that we have these things built for regular people he says Sadly and maddeningly for anyone caught short that lovely idea now feels as quaint and fanciful as an ornate urinal,health

chars,Switch hairdresser The cost of looking after your hair can add up to hundreds of pounds a year with prices for women averaging about 50 for a cut 35 for a blowdry and more than 80 for highlights according to recent figures from the Hair and Beauty Industry Authority Habia But like any service you can shop around for the best deal There are thousands of hairdressers to choose from and a small local salon may offer a much cheaper rate than a chain Compare prices and ask for cheaper recommendations in your neighbourhood on sites such as Nextdoor and your local Facebook and WhatsApp groups Many hairdressers also offer new customers money off their first cut  perhaps 25  so you can try out different salons and get a discount Meanwhile during the current cost of living crisis some hairdressers have been offering pay what you can afford and even free haircuts to struggling customers Downgrade your stylist Ask for a junior as they are usually a much cheaper option than a senior stylist with years of experience The difference in price can be hundreds of pounds depending on what you have done These stylists are fully trained and usually eager to do a good job and more experienced hairdressers will typically check that they dont make any big mistakes Joan Scott chief executive of Habia says Look at the treatment and service menu and see if theres a more affordable option If youre not sure ask your salon what options are available within your budget Be flexible If you are able to get your hair done on weekday for example or on a particular evening you may save a small fortune Hairdressers often run discount days or offer cheaper prices during quieter times such as midmorning When you are making an appointment ask when their cheaper times are and what they suggest for the best deal If you are really flexible leave it to the last minute and a hairdresser may be able to offer a hefty discount for a vacant appointment Discounts and cashback Search Groupon for salons offering discounts Go to the website enter your area and search for the service you are after There are usually lots of deals on offer This week when we looked a deal on Groupon offered balayage a hair colouring technique with a wash cut and blowdry for 39 instead of 125 at a central London salon You could also try Wowcher which works in a similar way and was this week offering deals such as savings of up to 79 on a keratin hair treatment Cashback sites such as TopCashback are a goto when it comes to hair products offering money back on wellknown brands such as Sephora Boots and Superdrug As with any product compare prices in discount stores supermarkets and pharmacies to make sure you get the lowest price Be a model Search for salons that need models for their trainee hairdressers An experienced stylist will be present for the process to avoid any disastrous mistakes For example Toni  Guy often wants volunteers at its London and Manchester salons to get a cheap cut from its supervised academy students You could get your hair cut from as little as 10 in a top salon this way You can sign up to be a cut and colour model at the Vidal Sassoon teaching academy in London but be aware that you are asked to leave a minimum of three hours for the appointment When we looked the London Hairdressing Academy was offering a range of discounted services such as a wash cut and finish for 11 or 35 for a full head of highlights if you are booking with one of its students However perhaps not surprisingly in the current cost of living crisis the model slots often get booked up quickly You may also find that your area has a local beauty college that offers cheap cuts Loyalty schemes Some salons such as Headmasters run loyalty schemes and plenty are offering discounts to help customers during the cost of living crisis You can sign up online and get a Headmasters card offering 25 off all services from Monday to Friday 9am4pm and 10 at other times It also has a referafriend scheme offering 40 off a cut and style for you and your friend If you are already a regular at a particular salon check you are signed up to any loyalty scheme it offers There may be other discounts too such as complimentary blowdry appointments to try the service before you book Do it yourself You may have already tried cutting or colouring your hair at home during the pandemic lockdowns when hairdressers shut up shop If you did you will probably have discovered its not as easy as it looks However if you want to give it a go there are plenty of videos online such as this one that guide you through the haircutting process You can order professional hairdressing scissors online which are specially angled for a sharper cut Also if you spend a lot on hair products or pay for conditioning treatments at the salon get creative and make your own You can make an effective hair mask out of egg avocado and olive oil Search online for inspiration A mobile hairdresser Plenty of selfemployed hairdressers have set up a mobile service or work in their own homes for a fraction of salon prices As they dont have to pay salon overheads they are usually substantially cheaper They can also be useful if you struggle to find time to go the hairdresser and want a more convenient and relaxing experience Many offer appointments outside salon hours too such as on Sundays or after 6pm Search for your local mobile hairdresser at Your Local Hairdresser Watch out for extras Hairdressers often try to sell you styling products or special conditioning treatments when you are at the salon But these typically add a lot to your bill so make sure to opt out if you are asked and doublecheck that you are not being charged for extras at the till You could also ditch your regular

that just before the second national lockdown began those born in Britain in 1958 and 1970 were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress on average than they had ever experienced in adulthood before surpassing previous peaks in their early 40s Data collected over four decades from more than 16000 Britishborn adults which was analysed by academics from University College London and Kings College London also found that those born in 1946 had similar levels of psychological distress to their previous midlife peak in their early 50s This peak of anxiety during the first year of the pandemic was higher for women than men across all age groups widening the already substantial gender inequalities in mental health that existed before the pandemic Most of the studies we analysed propose that this is due to a totally different share of the domestic and caring responsibilities during lockdown said Dr Dario MorenoAgostino lead author of the report An increase in genderbased violence and abuse as well as additional financial constraints are also suggested because theres evidence showing that women were in more precarious situations than men for instance from the work point of view more care workers  typically women  were exposed to more difficulties than other professions he added This unforeseen second midlife mental health crisis may accelerate and exacerbate the onset and occurrence of chronic mental health and health difficulties increasing pressures on the NHS the study suggests There is the question of resilience but we know that anxiety and depression are the top leading causes of disease worldwide said MorenoAgostino Those mental health problems are closely linked to numerous physical health problems  right up to and including increased morbidity The fact that we are observing an unexpected new peak of the very mental health problems that can lead to these longterm trajectories is deeply concerning he added The study contradicts a recent study by McGill University researchers in Canada which found Covid19 may not have taken as great a toll on the mental health of most people as earlier research indicated That research based on a review of 137 studies from around the world said some of the public narrative around the mental health impacts of Covid19 were based on poorquality studies and anecdotes which became selffulfilling prophecies adding that there was a need for more rigorous science Along with other experts MorenoAgostino disputed these findings He warned that McGills worldwide approach could not accurately assess the impact of the pandemic on individual groups such as children women and people with low incomes or preexisting mental health problems in specific countries skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First

women had experienced worsening anxiety depression or general mental health symptoms during the pandemic That study also pointed to causes including juggling more family responsibilities careers in health or social care and domestic abuse Other robust studies have reached different conclusions to the McGill paper suggesting that the mental health impact of the pandemic has been severe In 2021 researchers at the University of Queensland found that anxiety and depression around the world had increased dramatically in 2020 In April 2021 the Royal College of Psychiatrists observed a sharp rise in mental ill health In February 2022 NHS leaders warned of a second pandemic of depression anxiety psychosis and eating disorders But Prof Peter Tyrer emeritus professor in community psychiatry at Imperial College London stressed that the McGill work was of good quality and reflects much of what we now know He agreed with the researchers conclusion that the pandemic had a similar positive effect on resilience to wars because social cohesion despite the handicaps of lockdown and social distancing improves when there is a common enemy,health

investigation revealing a national s 6607 chars,Some of Britains most vulnerable children are being moved to care homes more than 300 miles away from the neighbourhoods they grew up in according to an Observer investigation revealing a national scandal The shocking figures make clear for the first time the scale of the crisis that has long worried child welfare experts They show dozens of children from London alone are in foster or care homes more than 250 miles from the city as councils battle a significant shortfall in provision Children from the capital have been placed in homes near Perth Glasgow Knowsley Leeds and Carlisle Care experts said that the pattern is being repeated across the country removing children from critical support networks and familiar surroundings About 600 children from London are in foster or residential care more than 50 miles from their home neighbourhoods Councils have warned they often have to compete for limited places and face rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children Some children need to be placed in certain locations for their own safety However there is widespread acceptance that the care system is failing to provide enough appropriate places in the right areas Experts warn that relocating children removed them from schools friends and extended family as well as clubs and activities that were often key to their wellbeing They warned it also put some at greater risk of exploitation According to the Observers findings uncovered using the Freedom of Information Act at least 37 children from the capital are placed more than 250 miles away The figure is likely to be far higher as some councils did not reveal precise numbers At least 600 are more than 50 miles away John Pearce from the Association of Directors of Childrens Services said the investigation highlighted a pressing and longstanding national issue that we continue to raise with the government  a lack of local placements for the children in our care Local authorities are working hard to overcome the sufficiency challenges they face he said But we need the support of the government to address the significant challenges we all face as well as rising costs and profiteering on the backs of vulnerable children Clare Bracey director of policy and campaigns at Become a charity for care leavers and those still in care said being moved far from home left children lonely and isolated This is a national scandal and is getting worse she said There are sometimes reasons why these moves are necessary for the child but the reality is that for many children these moves are happening because there just are not enough suitable places for them to stay close to home They are being let down Chris Wild a care leaver who campaigns for more legal protections for care leavers said he knew of cases of children being moved several times a year I was in the care system 30 years ago but from everything Im seeing nothing has changed he said Theres evidence these moves put them at greater risk of going missing ending up homeless or developing severe mental health issues An independent review of childrens social care last year revealed a system spiralling out of control recommending a fiveyear 26bn plan to improve it However ministers initially pledged just 200m over two years The government has since said it has added 259m to fund homes Anne Longfield the former childrens commissioner for England said the large distances involved were a symptom of a broken system I have heard so many horrific stories of teenagers who are moved far from home to places where they know nobody she said They then become easy pickings for those who want to exploit and abuse children The independent review of childrens social care published a year ago provided a roadmap to fixing this crisis However the governments halfhearted response and its failure to provide the levels of investment required means hundreds of vulnerable children will continue to be put at risk in places they cant even place on a map Rachel de Souza Englands current childrens commissioner said she wanted to see particular attention paid to sibling groups those with mental health needs or disabilities or who live in custody for whom being placed large distances from their families and support networks can leave them without any of the positive relationships in their lives that other children take for granted skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they

placements with some of the young people needing to be moved for their own safety They said keeping all children within their neighbourhoods was always the aim and that the vast majority of children were placed within their boroughs There are also several studies and plans under way to create more secure child care home places However many acknowledged the serious shortcomings hampering the system There is a crisis in the residential care home sector where a scarcity of places means that it can be extremely hard to find a suitable home for children  especially if they have complex or specific needs said Anntoinette Bramble deputy mayor of Hackney A Greenwich borough council spokesperson said that a lack of sufficient placement options is a national issue for children in care Marian James from Sutton council said The independent review of childrens care recommended more funding for childrens social care which we wholeheartedly agree with along with reform of the childrens care system but we need to receive adequate funding to enable the whole of the review recommendations to be fully realised A Department for Education spokesperson said Local authorities are responsible for placing looked after children and must look to make placements in the childs best interests which in most cases means a child is placed within 20 miles of their home In addition to the 200m announced in March we are investing 259m to create more placements for children in highquality and safe homes We are also investing over 27m to recruit and retain more foster carers and are working to develop a new regional model of delivering care placements helping more children stay closer to their home networks,health
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/03/lead-litter-picking-group-defend-litterers,I lead a litterpicking group but I will always defend litterers This is why  Leila Taheri,If any anger

bobbing flotilla of plastic shores made up of plastic and a heron starving to death due to red nylon tangled around its beak Last month a new disease caused solely by plastics was discovered in seabirds And in February our group Friends of the Welsh Harp removed four tonnes of rubbish from a river and the surrounding woodland Our rivers are not only open sewers theyre also open dustbins that lead to the sea Youd think based on this that Id feel angry at those who litter  that Id resent them But I dont And I believe you should resist that temptation too Let me explain why I investigated why people litter as part of a psychoanalytic studies MA and found that on an individual level littering is a kind of revenge on society  its a litmus test of how people are feeling And judging by what I see on a daily basis many people are feeling alienated disconnected and excluded They are angry and are taking it out on the world Is that any surprise when local communities are broken or nonexistent their deep local knowledge lost and connection to nature severed In a time of polycrisis climate breakdown cost of living crisis assaults on democracy threats to the NHS negative feelings about the world and yourself have got to go somewhere Nature  exposed unprotected wild and often neglected  is a perfect place to dump those rubbish feelings whether thats doing it physically with litter or going on a walk to destress The impulse to litter comes from a feeling that we cannot really affect the world negatively or positively  after all what impact can one individual have compared with a polluting company let alone a whole polluting country It comes from a lack of belief in the power of the individual to effect change which in itself is rooted in feelings of despair and hopelessness Such feelings are understandable when the scale of the environmental crisis is as staggering as it is now Volunteers clear litter off the beach and foreshore at Aberystwyth Wales Photograph aberCPCAlamy When we assume the moral fault lies only with the litterers we let those creating the systemic problems off the hook After all littering exposes our economic model for what it is profitdriven unaccountable and amoral Littering is fuelled by manufacturers that continue to push hard to generate waste for profit In the 1950s a speaker at a plastics conference announced to delegates that your future is in the garbage wagon The public were actually taught by these profiteers to throw things away so they keep making and selling Fast forward to today and plastic production is set to triple by 2060 If we really want things to change if we want our green and blue spaces back we need real legislative change on plastic packaging Yet as local authorities and government agencies become even more cashstrapped its convenient for them to ignore all this and blame the individuals who litter and flytip then leave the cleanup to volunteer groups like ours It suits them too to minimise the problem the Canal and River Trust CRT which has guardianship of all of Britains waterways including the Welsh Harp played down the plastic pollution crisis by describing it as unsightly rubbish Natural England the governments adviser for the environment supports our litterpicking efforts to improve the aesthetic of these areas What can be done Shaming and denouncing litterers attitudes does not work It leads to stubborn refusal and entrenches litterers more deeply in their position reinforcing their negative behaviours Rather than a blaming moralistic attitude towards them we might do better adopting a more thoughtful and understanding stance Hello how are you is a much better starting point than Dont be a tosser If any anger is justified it should be directed at profiteering manufacturers and our throwaway culture We must help people overcome the ecological alienation that ultimately leads them to mistreat their environment Overcoming this alienation means forming attachments which means caring To be caring we need to feel cared for Our local authorities government and environmental groups need to be open and honest and show that they understand and care They should face reality recognise the staggering scale of issues and apologise for past neglect An open honest society mourns the fact that the earth cant endlessly give  that it has limitations It recognises that it must engage in actual practical care of humans wildlife and plant life through thoughtful action and collaboration It must support volunteer groups such as ours that are doing meaningful ecocare work like many other caring professions our work is undervalued As individuals when we reconnect with nature and enjoy whatever green and blue spaces we have locally preferably with others love soon blossoms As with human relationships you soon find yourself caring and even feeling responsible You find yourself heartbroken when something bad happens You fight for these places and know you just cant live without them And if you can get some bureaucratic organisation to feel the same way too Ill buy you a drink,health

ketchup on them When I was younger this aversion extended to mayo barbecue sauce and other condiments but I am happy to eat most of those now I have a vague memory of someone smushing a sandwich with ketchup into my face as a child and the feeling of it being around my mouth and cheeks While Ive occasionally eaten some accidentally Im pretty sure Ive never dipped a chip or a nugget into ketchup in my life Becci Wood 31 London When we had fruit salad at school I used to put the oranges in my sock Cant even be in a room with the smell of oranges  and definitely not in a train carriage Ive moved

to be greeted by an overwhelming stale coffee smell and then his coffee breath I even went to Ethiopia and frequented coffee shops with coffee grinds on the floor but couldnt bring myself to drink any Although I dont drink it I am able to discern between cheap coffee and freshly ground coffee I feel like retching when I smell cheap coffee freshly ground coffee is only a tad more bearable It goes without saying that I dont eat anything with coffee in it either tiramisu coffee cake etc Not succumbing to the coffee craze over the years has saved me a fortune AJ 36 Surrey I hated carbonated

never had CocaCola or watched an episode of Friends and is possibly less American than they are I dont know if Id try it Its not something that would make me retch but between the carbonation and the sugar content Id probably find it unpleasant Jan 20 Groningen American living in the Netherlands I dont like squishy foods like banana I havent had a banana since I was about six months old I went off them and I have no intention of ever revisiting them Its the smell it makes me feel ill Then theres the texture  I dont like soft and squishy food I used to hate meatloaf for the same reason I had

leading heart surgeons have warned Ther 4190 chars,Critically ill patients will inevitably die because hospitals are having to cancel surgery as a direct result of next weeks junior doctors strike in England leading heart experts have warned There were bound to be fatalities among people with serious heart problems whose precarious health meant they were a ticking timebomb and needed surgery as soon as possible they said They added that patients would face an even greater risk than usual of being harmed or dying if their timesensitive operation was delayed because NHS heart units would have too few medics available during the fourday stoppage by junior doctors to run normal operating lists The trio of cardiac experts are senior doctors at the Royal Brompton and Harefield specialist heart and lung hospitals in London Those facilities plus the cardiac unit at St Thomas hospital in the capital have between them postponed between 30 and 40 operations they were due to conduct next week on P2 patients whose fragile health means they need surgery within 28 days One of our trusts core values is to put patients first and so I feel it is only right to warn that some patients will inevitably die due to the cumulative impact of delaying hundreds who are on the waiting list said Dr Richard GrocottMason a cardiologist who is also the chief executive of the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals Those cancellations would mean that many of the 300 P2 patients waiting for heart surgery at the three hospitals would have to wait even longer before they finally got it he added P2s are the NHSs secondhighest priority group of patients who need surgery of any sort behind emergency cases who need it immediately as their life will otherwise be at risk It is no exaggeration to say that delaying surgery for this group P2s will result in harm For some this may be lifechanging For others it may mean premature death GrocottMason said Dr Mark Mason a cardiologist who is the medical director for heart lung and critical care at the Guys and St Thomas NHS trust that runs all three hospitals said Its a cliche but these P2 patients really are sat on a ticking timebomb The risk of them suffering a cardiac arrest rose the longer they had to wait for surgery he added If they do its then a question of how lucky they are to have a bystander perform CPR on them and how quickly the ambulance gets to them These patients are sat waiting for an unpredictable and potentially fatal cardiac event to happen Last months first threeday strike by junior doctors in England over their demand for a 35 pay rise led to 175000 outpatient appointments and operations being cancelled NHS bosses fear next weeks fourday stoppage which starts at 7am on Tuesday 11 April will force them to reschedule as many as 250000 appointments GrocottMason Mason and their colleague Mario Petrou the Brompton and Harefield hospitals clinical director for cardiovascular services decided to speak out to raise concerns  widely shared by senior doctors and NHS doctors  about patients with a range of serious health problems including cancer potentially coming to harm next week because their surgery is cancelled We cannot in all conscience stand by and just let this happen without advocating for our current and future patients said GrocottMason referring to his teams cardiovascular patients Heart patients across the country will face the same risks as most heart units are taking the same type of action and postponing operations listed for next week Sadly this increased risk is going to be true for patients needing planned heart surgery not just in London but across England said GrocottMason The British Medical Associations junior doctors committee decided not to offer any derogations or exemptions for any areas of lifeordeath care next week including AE and intensive care and maternity services in an attempt to ramp up pressure on the government The three surgeons urged the government and the BMA to hold talks to try to avert a strike and asked the BMA to rethink its stance on derogations and instead allow junior doctors to keep working next week in critical care units and cardiovascular surgery GrocottMason said the BMA should follow the lead of the Royal College of Nursing which exempted many areas of lifeordeath care from the strikes it has held since December A BMA spokesperson said Ahead of the first round of industrial action NHS England worked with trusts across England to assess their readiness for the planned industrial action In addition a joint communication from NHS Englands medical director and Prof Philip Banfield BMA chair of council was shared with all trusts in England explaining the process to request a derogation We met with NHS England four times per day during the strikes and not a single request was made over the course of three days of action The same arrangements will exist this time and it will be up to NHS England to decide if they want to use them,health

going to happen Flintham 61 from Rotherham is one of many who found the pandemic brought mental health challenges She experienced high levels of anxiety especially as she had elderly parents in poor health Every morning I would wake up stressed wondering if I my partner or parents would get Covid or die she says A very close friends husband died with Covid early on  it really brought home how bad it was Tina Flintham Research has found that in late 2020 British people in their 50s and early 60s were dealing with higher levels of psychological distress than they had ever experienced before in adulthood For many over50s the pandemic triggered a second midlife crisis with women worst affected Flintham who is now retired had been through a period of depression in her mid50s which she attributes to the menopause I was very low but I managed to carry on working It was a physical feeling of being down and went on for three months I was at the point of thinking go to the doctor but then it just went She says she gritted her teeth and got through it adding that she has always relied on exercise But lockdown brought new challenges for Flintham who worked for the local authority at the time Ive always been a very sociable person always meeting up with friends doing yoga and swimming but I had none of that to help me through I really missed swimming  I even dreamt about it She found taking walks in the nearby countryside was a godsend in coping with the stress I lost my confidence I dont go out half as much as I used to The turning point for her mental health came with the vaccine rollout and as society opened up While much of the anxiety began to dissipate she still feels its echoes Sometimes I wake up and have similar feelings about what today is going to bring I lost my confidence I dont go out half as much as I used to and I have to push myself to Once Im out Im fine but before I never even thought things like that Also being in confined spaces with lots of people  I still feel weird about that Mark Dawes Although Mark Dawes 60 had experienced bouts of mild to moderate depression before he was always able to cope by forcing himself to socialise and stay active But when the Londonbased charity worker lost his father on the second day of lockdown his grief blurred into depression for months I had to deal with the grief alone  even the funeral had to be fully virtual as it was not possible to travel he says Living alone was very isolating and all social life was stopped  and relying on public transport meant I could not even travel to go walking in the nearby countryside While he has experienced psychologically challenging periods before this time the isolation felt very different It all ground to a halt Then you had the pandemic itself which was pretty scary when it started off It was a blur of days with no events in them I was living but not really living About a year into the pandemic Dawes began to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy and with the loosening of the pandemic started to feel better But he says there has been a lasting impact including not being able to properly grieve for his father I dont enjoy life as much as I used to I look forward to things less  lifes a bit greyer It all ground to a halt  I was living but not really living The pandemic also landed a blow to those who had never dealt with mental health difficulties before In the early months of lockdown Sally not her real name in her early 60s developed severe anxiety and low mood for the first time in her life I was completely taken by surprise as I have never suffered with these issues before I spent large parts of the day in tears Everyday tasks became difficult and over time I found it hard to face people At nighttime I shook had hot flushes bad dreams and struggled to sleep I am finally beginning to enjoy life again Sally who is retired and lives in the east Midlands became very fearful of Covid When some restrictions began to be relaxed I struggled to cope with seeing people even in the garden I didnt feel able to go to public places such as shops Each morning I woke up with a feeling of dread and sadness By October 2020 she realised she needed help and began talking therapy over the phone In the end I decided I needed to face my fears and get back to some kind of normal life I began by forcing myself to do things such as go into shops little by little not something that I found easy she says adding that returning to the gym was also important I no longer think about Covid every waking moment and I am finally beginning to enjoy life again,health
