towards batters was revealed in his book and then executed in some fashion against the Delhi Capitals batsmen,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing h 5228 chars,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture  what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing helmets guards and pads to face him All you know is that you hate them Perhaps hates a strong word Or it isnt because all they want to do is make you look bad Theyll want to hit you for a boundary and if they do a slowmo of the shot will follow on the big screen to embarrass you even more A commentator will say you bowled too full too short or too wide and pick apart your technique Twitter will go into overdrive and say youre s or something and at the end of the day the captain will be asked in his press conference if you should be dropped for the next game writes Wood Compound this with 400 in four overs an envy inducing opening duo and a track that just offered 193 runs on it in the first innings with more dew settled on the surface And also the fact that his last IPL experience didnt go quite well Pulling a shutter down on all of it Wood steamed in to bowl that first delivery Trying to keep his strides short as he would mention later I feel at ease doing that charging in and letting it fly And just as he landed hard on that left foot with the impact shifting his toe right to the tip of his boot Wood let the ball fly Banged in short forcing a fivefeetsix Prithvi Shaw to hop and defend it down with all his might A hundredandforty something registered on the speed gun Quickest of the evening so far Itd get quicker The short ball has for long been the Achilles heel in Shaws short career So Wood delivered another Quick short but wide Now a little further up Softening him but keeping it quick And then he took it out of the proverbial hat A 1473kph fuller delivery angled in Pierced between the bat and pad to rattle the off stump About six months ago Wood had conceded he was almost done with Test cricket Good heavens he wasnt The 33yearold was in fact using the T20 stage to showcase his Test cricket arsenal A typical red ball setup to get that wicket One brings two here lads The most common of slip cordon phrases wouldve worked its way through his head There is no other reason that explains him catering to an almost identical pace and length off the next one Mitchell Marsh had been Australias top run scorer across the three ODIs and series in India He was used to such wickets and conditions having taken the attack to bowlers on these very surfaces On Saturday night however he stood posing for a straight drive as his off stump was cleaned up behind him Two wickets in two balls and Delhi sent in the closest they could to a Don Bradman For Sarfaraz Khan Wood packaged a Ctrl CV Shawstopping combo Short good length and full on the off Not a run was scored off the bat in that over This while the injury prone quick struggled with the dew I fall at even the best of times He had managed to bowl in a practice game under the same conditions during the evening at the same venue But at training you dont have the same intensity that you have during a match Intensity on which the Super Giants had to bank on for at least another over in a row David Warner had batted the most deliveries for Delhi so far Having been recently exiled from the Australian Test team there couldnt have been a better preAshes Test for the DC captain against one of Englands best Advertisement First up a 148 clicks banger that forced him to hop and fend deep in his crease Followed by a test of quick footwork to defend a good length ball on the off Then a 144 clicks short one which was negotiated for a single  the first off Wood Seeing as the new batter was on strike he decided to throw in a final surprise card and take the pace off In his threedelivery setup to Sarfaraz the England pacer catered only to the short length but turned down his speed from 140 to 137 kph A little more on the ball wouldve taken Sarfarazs uppercut over the long leg boundary Instead he was caught a couple of meters ahead Almost falling down while attempting the shot off a vicious incoming delivery Two overs Three runs Three wickets It wasnt quite game set match to Lucknow but Delhi never quite recovered from that Wood spell A spell meticulously worked on having tested its antagonists as if it were on a Test cricket morning and not under the lights during a franchise league The plan and preparation for it Morne Morkel LSG fast bowling coach has been really good with me Just try to bowl similar to what I do for England Wood shared with the player of the match trophy in his hand for a first five wicket haul in IPL 2023 This is the ideal format for him suggested former England spinner Graeme Swann on broadcast highlighting Woods constant bouts with injuries in the fiveday format In those first two overs though he had breathed Test cricket into a T20 match,Former England pace bowler Mark Wood has revealed the secrets of his fast bowling.,health
