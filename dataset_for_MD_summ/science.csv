Organisation ISRO on Sunday successfully flew and landed an autonomous reusable spaceplane The agency hoisted the Reusable Launch Vehicle Autonomous Landing Mission RLV LEX to an altitude of 45km beneath a helicopter then watched as it navigated a steep approach to land 46km downrange The vehicle is designed to launch atop a rocket enter orbit deploy payloads then return to Earth and land on a runway Readers will not be surprised to learn that the craft looks a lot like the USs retired Space Shuttle and Russias Buran reusable vehicle RLV LEX is however purely experimental at this stage and is yet to reach orbit A 2016 test saw the vehicle released at an altitude of 65km and successfully demonstrate hypersonic flight capabilities The Sunday test did not achieve similar speeds but did manage a hot landing at 350kmh ISRO hopes the vehicle one day makes it possible to launch payloads to orbit for just 4000kg  well below the cost of competing launch services  Simon Sharwood YouTube

after a lack of support from Microsoft and other big publishers In January the news about big publishers like Microsoft Sony and Nintendo not joining this years Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 event surfaced In March Microsoft confirmed it wouldnt be on the E3 showfloor but said it would costream Xbox Games Showcase as part of E3 Digital Xbox Head Phil Spencer also expressed support for E3 despite this decision Xbox is on the board of the ESA and I think a successful and healthy ESA is critical to what were trying to go do Spencer told IGN So we place our showcase like we always have done at a time where hopefully its convenient for press and even consumers that are going to the E3 event and thats what were trying to do now We will continue to work with ESA in terms of their plans As I said were on the board and we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to help make the E3 successful However as more publishers like Ubisoft pulled out of the event organizers at ReedPop and ESA decided to cancel E3 This was a difficult decision because of all the effort we and our partners put toward making this event happen but we had to do whats right for the industry and whats right for E3 said Kyle MarsdenKish ReedPop Global VP of Gaming We appreciate and understand that interested companies wouldnt have playable demos ready and that resourcing challenges made being at E3 this summer an obstacle they couldnt overcome For those who did commit to E3 2023 were sorry we cant put on the showcase you deserve and that youve come to expect from ReedPops event experiences Microsoft versus Google in cloud battle Recently the search giant slammed the software company by accusing it of anticompetitive cloud practices and said that its upcoming deals with European cloud vendors are not the absolute solution for licensing term concerns Googles comment came as its response regarding the latest antitrust complaints being scrutinized by the European Union regulators Vice President and Head of Platform for Google Cloud Amit Zavery detailed this in his statement to Reuters Theyre selectively kind of buying out those ones who complain and not make those terms available to everyone So that definitely makes it an unfair advantage to Microsoft and ties the people who complained back to Microsoft anyway Whatever theyre offering there should be terms across for everybody not just for one or two theyve chosen and pick and that shows you that they have so much market power they can kind of go and do those things individually My point to the regulators would be that they should look at this holistically even though one or two vendors might settle doesnt solve the broader problem And thats the problem we need to really resolve not individual vendors problems 2nd Gen

The new Galaxy S23 starts at 90 9819 chars,Weekly deals the best smartphone deals from the UK Germany India and the US This week we found some major discounts on current flagships plus deals on midrangers and some entrylevel phones Use the links below to jump to your region UK The new Galaxy S23 starts at 900 unless you engage in tradein deals The Galaxy S22 is still a fairly capable phone and it is a good deal cheaper at 540 This was the last generation of Exynospowered Sphones in Europe but the rest of the hardware is similar enough its not like the S23 got a QHD LTPO display or faster than 25W charging Alternatively you can pick up the Galaxy S21 FE 5G that one does have a Snapdragon chip even if it is the 888 The S22 is the better phone but is it 70 better If youre fine with or actually want a larger 64 display the FE could be better suited to you Alternatively the Poco F4 GT will get you the newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and an even larger 667 display not to mention super fast 120W charging no wireless The cameras arent as good as on the Samsungs though If you want a flagshipgrade camera the OnePlus 10 Pro is still around and packs a trio of Hasselblad modules including an 8MP 77mm tele lens It also uses the 8 Gen 1 chipset and offers both 80W wired and 65W wireless charging for its 5000mAh battery It costs more than the three models above however at 600 The Xiaomi 11T Pro is getting up in age its a 2021 model but it has a Snapdragon 888 for 350 120 less than the S21 FE While it doesnt have a tele cam the 108MP main camera does a decent job at zooming in This phone also has 120W fast charging and a 5000mAh battery no wireless though The Pixel 6a is under 300 and while its replacement the 7a is coming Google has not set a reveal date yet its rumored to launch in June Leaks point to a 500 price tag on the mainland so the 6a will probably stick around as the cheaper option By the way you can get the Pixel 6a bundled with the Pixel Buds Aseries Or you can get the TWS headset on its own for just over 60 Going up against the Pixel is the Galaxy A33 The new A34 is available in the UK already but it costs 90 more Compared to the Google Phone the A33 offers a larger 64 90Hz display vs 61 60Hz a microSD slot and a larger 5000mAh battery with 25W charging vs 4410mAh18W Well make a quick detour through Apple land Amazon offers the iPhone 14 for just under 800 a small discount compared to how much it costs on Applecom If thats too much or you want a smaller phone the iPhone 13 mini is 600 for a 128GB unit The Nokia G22 and Galaxy A13 both have mediumsized screens 65 and 66 respectively The Nokia offers a 90Hz IPS panel with HD resolution the Samsung is sharper but slower with an FHD 60Hz display The G22 has more processing power with the Unisoc T606 chipset which features a pair of A75 big cores vs all A55 cores in the Exynos 850 Its 5050mAh battery also does 20W charging vs 5000mAh 15W Both phones have microSD slots and 35mm headphone jacks Both phones have 50MP main cameras but only the Galaxy has an ultra wide lens 5MP sensor HMD partnered with iFixit to provide guides tools and parts for fixing the G22 at home Samsung does this only for its flagships Well wrap things up with a wide range of Galaxy tablets The Galaxy Tab S8 may offer the best priceperformance ratio All three Tab S8 models use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset and start with 8128GB memory configuration they all have card slots The Galaxy Tab S8 has a larger 124 Super AMOLED display compared to the 11 LCD on the vanilla model All three slates offer 120Hz refresh rate The Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is the biggest of the bunch and just plain big with a 146 display Between DeX mode and several keyboard options this can replace a laptop If those are too pricey the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite the 2022 rerelease costs less than half the Tab S8 It has a similarly sized 104 LCD but it is a 60Hz panel Also the Snapdragon 720G is anything but powerful Still with a microSD slot and speakers tuned by AKG this can be a great pick for multimedia and casual browsing Or if you just want something cheap the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is down to 120 The 87 1340 x 800px display isnt great and the Helio P22T is slower than even the 720G but at that price this could work as tablet for the little one  if they break it oh well Germany Google IO 2023 is scheduled for May 10 and we should get an update on the nextgen Pixels For now there is the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro which continue to duck under the pricing of Galaxy and iPhone flagships The Xiaomi 13 is normally a 1000 phone Amazon offers it for a bit less It comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset but lacks the triple 50MP camera setup of the Pro model Speaking of the Xiaomi 13 Pro its 1 camera can be yours for 1300 This also includes a QHD 120Hz LTPO display and faster 120W wired charging up from 67W Its a pricey phone but its camera impressed in our recent shootout Last week we listed the whole iPhone 14 generation which had pretty solid discounts on Amazon Those are still available so this week we wanted to focus on the previous generation Apple is still selling the nonPro duo but you can get a better deal on Amazon The Redmi Note 12 4G went on sale just this week and can be had for 200 Thats 100 less than the 5G version though note that the Note 12 5G has double the storage Other than the chipset the two models are pretty similar For another 100 on top of that you can pick up the Redmi Note 12 Pro with double the RAM and a more respectable Dimensity 1080 chipset instead of the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 in the vanilla 5G model This one also has faster charging and OIS on its 50MP camera 1156 Alternatively the venerable Samsung Galaxy A52s is still around and can be had for 130 less than the new Galaxy A54 The new model has some advantages though that price gap makes them seem pretty small What the Nokia has going for it is a microSD slot both have 35mm jacks and a stock Android that will be updated to Android 14 and will continue to get security patches until the end of 2024 at least The Nokia X20 costs 50 more than the Realme 9 Pro even though the Realme has the better chipset Dimensity 920 vs Snapdragon 480 and better camera 50MP main with OIS 8MP ultra wide vs 64MP main 5MP ultra wide and faster charging battery 4500mAh 60W vs 18W The Realme also has a 64 90Hz AMOLED display compared to a 667 IPS LCD 60Hz on the X20 India The OnePlus 10T and iQOO 9T both cost the same at 50000 They have large 120Hz AMOLED FHD displays and both are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 The batteries are similar with a slight advantage for the OnePlus 4800mAh150W for the 10T and 4700mAh120W for the iQOO The iQOO 9T has the lightly better cameras though with mostly identical main modules it also offers a better ultra wide 13MP vs 8MP and a short zoom lens  12MP 47mm Samsung started shipping the Galaxy A54 a week ago but initially the 8128GB units were hard to find Its 2000 cheaper than the 8256GB version and you can pick up a 256GB microSD for less than that or go with something bigger a 512GB SanDisk is 3330 The iQOO Neo 6 and Galaxy S20 FE are fairly close in price dont forget to click the 3000 coupon for the Samsung The iQOO uses the Snapdragon 870 chipset the S20 FE the vanilla Snapdragon 865 Both have midsized 120Hz displays FHD AMOLED panels The iQOO stands out with its 4700mAh80W battery vs 4500mAh25W for the Galaxy though it also has 15W wireless The Galaxy S20 FE has a 3x zoom camera 8MP and a microSD slot however Android 13 is likely its last OS update it is a 2020 model after all The iQOO is from mid2022 The vivo Y100 and Y56 went on sale last month They are fairly similar except hat the Y100 has the better screen 638 90Hz AMOLED vs 658 60Hz IPS LCD both FHD better chipset Dimensity 900 vs 700 and better main camera  64MP with OIS and 4K video vs 50MP no OIS no 4K The Y100 also has 44W fast charging for its 4500mAh battery the Y63 has more capacity 5000mAh but only charges at 18W Still its also 5000 cheaper The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G  the SMA146B variant specifically  uses the new Exynos 1330 chipset and has a 66 90Hz LCD with FHD resolution Its 5000mAh battery is as slow to charge as the Y56s it supports only 15W charging and it has a comparable 50MP main camera neither has an ultra wide lens The Tecno Spark 8 Pro is a rare sight in the sub10000 segment  fullfledged Android version 11 but still an FHD display 68 IPS LCD a large 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging and an okay 48MP main camera no ultra wide It also has a microSD slot and a 35mm jack It doesnt have 5G connectivity but the Helio G85 chipset is normally found in much pricier phones USA While Samsung was taking preorders for the Galaxy S23 series it offered a free memory upgrade  an offer that has since expired Amazon is bringing it back though This means that you can get a Galaxy S22 256GB for the same price as the 128GB unit The Galaxy S23 and S23 Ultra switch to 512GB for no extra cost over the 256GB models The Sony WF1000XM5 are just around the corner but the old XM4 left us with little to complain about even after months of usage Currently they are 50 below their usual price Sony also has the highly specific Link Buds which are designed so that you can always hear your surroundings  they have a hole in them For a more traditional design with Active Noise Cancellation you can get the LinkBuds S instead they arent as good as the WF1000XM4 but they cost 50 less too Alternatively you can have the Google Pixel Buds Pro at the same 150 price tag We have reviewed all of these buds so you can read up on which ones will suit you best If the prices are too high for you you can also grab the Pixel Buds Aseries for about half the cost,science,This week we found some major discounts on current flagships plus deals on midrangers and some entrylevel phones

chars,The democratic process of any country demands transparency and decency These two poles determine the electoral faith of citizens But electoral democracy is just one part of democracy It ensures that demos or the people of the nation have representation in structuring and functioning of the State By having an election their say in making laws is ensured And the law determines the State However do elections ensure democracy or is it the majority Aristotle says the will of the majority is a bad idea because it can undermine the State Democracy in its pristine form concedes to the will wherein various factors decide the majority In the Indian context Dr B R Ambedkar argued that Indian metrics of power are decided with the majority and the minority wherein the majority is both a number and a cultural majority This takes the shape of communal majoritarianism which acts as a selfcontained group that is unable to think of the rest of society Thus there have to be special constitutional provisions to advance the interests of the minorities and protect them from the atrocities of the communal majorities That is how polity is separate from democracy since the latter by nature demands revolution At the other end of democracy is autocracy which if married with the principle of democracy has the ability to produce demagoguery The role of any processual democracy is to ensure good functioning of the State and in return have a civilized society serving the needs of the citizens Also read  Is democracy dying A postcard from a village in Odisha Citizens having rights and duties prescribed by the Constitution ensure their participation in the engine of the State Thus the philosophy of liberalism is often conflated with that of democracy In a coherent form of democratic governance absolutism and fear of autocratic tyranny are balanced by an engaged Opposition An enigmatic process in a democratic society the Opposition like the government is also voted by the people Therefore it is the voice of the public that is unrepresented in decisionmaking The moral cause of the Opposition is to arouse a sense of liberty and patriotism through difficult nationalism In his RPI manifesto Dr Ambedkar had envisaged the work of the Opposition to be vigilant exceeding the onceinfive years elections that do not guarantee real democracy Recently Opposition parties such as the Congress CPI CPIM AAP JDU Shiv Sena and NCP held a meeting in New Delhi to discuss the authenticity of processual democracy Their suspicion was directed towards the efficacy of electronic voting machines EVMs handling the worlds largest elections The Opposition often talks of technological interference via the Internet and programming of the machine as a tool for manipulation But it must be noted that the parties present at the meeting have ruled or are currently in power in states Doubts over EVMs were also raised by the BAMCEF Backward and Minority Community Employees Federation They even launched a nationwide agitation on the issue Advertisement The research community has demonstrated its defiance of EVMs A 2010 study by Prasad Halderman and Gonggrijp observed that EVMs are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot Computer scientists from Italy and the US found that the system was open to compromise Though one must take into account the efficiency of conducting elections via EVMs the possibility of corrupting a gadget is easily possible The Government of India has been accused of deploying Pegasus software to spy on its citizens Systems run by the Internet are prone to cyberattacks as was proved in the case of Irans nuclear facility at Natanz Cyberattacks involve theft of confidential data to manipulate programmes With the public still ignorant of technological advances the existence of esoteric knowledge on software manipulation makes EVMs an unfavourable option for many So how does one theorize the modern world in the womb of technology that is giving birth to new democracy The Opposition should start by demonstrating its seriousness over EVMs and not simply

horas en cajeros automticos alrededor del mundo Jean Lee Geoff White y Viv Jones BBC World Service 2 abril 2023 Fuente de la imagen Getty Images Imagina que eres un empleado de bajos ingresos en India a quien se le ofrece un da de trabajo como extra en una pelcula de Bollywood Tu rol Ir a un cajero automtico y retirar algo de dinero En 2018 varios hombres en el estado de Maharashtra pensaron que estaban aceptando un papel secundario en una pelcula pero en realidad los estaban engaando para que se convirtieran en mulas de dinero recolectando efectivo en un ambicioso atraco bancario El asalto tuvo lugar durante un fin de semana de agosto de 2018 y se centr en el Banco Cooperativo Cosmos con sede en Pune En una tranquila tarde de sbado el personal de la oficina central del banco recibi repentinamente una serie de mensajes alarmantes Eran de la compaa de tarjetas de pago Visa en Estados Unidos advirtiendo que podra haber miles de demandas por grandes retiros de efectivo en cajeros automticos por personas que aparentemente usaban tarjetas del Banco Cosmos Pero cuando el equipo de Cosmos revis sus propios sistemas no vieron transacciones anormales Aproximadamente media hora despus solo para estar seguros autorizaron a Visa para que detuviera todas las transacciones de las tarjetas bancarias Cosmos Este retraso result extremadamente costoso Al da siguiente Visa comparti la lista completa de transacciones sospechosas con la oficina central de Cosmos alrededor de 12000 retiros separados de diferentes cajeros automticos en todo el mundo El banco haba perdido casi US14 millones Fue un crimen audaz caracterizado por su gran escala y su meticulosa sincronizacin Los delincuentes haban saqueado cajeros automticos en 28 pases diferentes incluidos Estados Unidos Reino Unido Emiratos rabes Unidos y Rusia Todo sucedi en el espacio de solo dos horas y 13 minutos una extraordinaria movilizacin global organizada y criminal Eventualmente los investigadores rastrearan sus orgenes hasta un oscuro grupo de piratas informticos que haban llevado a cabo una sucesin de estafas anteriores aparentemente ordenadas por Corea del Norte Pero antes de tener una idea ms amplia del robo los investigadores de la unidad de delitos cibernticos de Maharashtra se sorprendieron al ver imgenes de CCTV de decenas de hombres caminando hacia una serie de cajeros automticos insertando tarjetas bancarias y metiendo billetes en bolsas No sabamos de una red de mulas de dinero como esta dice el inspector general Brijesh Singh quien dirigi la investigacin Un grupo criminal tena un encargado que estaba monitoreando las transacciones de los cajeros automticos en tiempo real en una computadora porttil cuenta Singh Las imgenes de CCTV mostraron que cada vez que una mula de dinero intentaba quedarse con algo de efectivo el encargado lo vea y le daba una fuerte bofetada Usando las imgenes de las cmaras de seguridad y los datos de los telfonos mviles de las reas cercanas a los cajeros automticos los investigadores indios pudieron arrestar a 18 sospechosos en las semanas posteriores al atraco La mayora estn ahora en prisin en espera de juicio Singh dice que estos hombres no eran ladrones empedernidos Entre los arrestados haba un mesero un chofer y un zapatero Otro tena un ttulo de farmacia Eran gente noble afirma A pesar de esto l cree que cuando ocurri el atraco incluso los hombres reclutados como extras saban lo que realmente estaban haciendo Pero saban para quin estaban trabajando Los investigadores creen que el secreto y aislado estado de Corea del Norte estuvo detrs del atraco Corea del Norte es una de las naciones ms pobres del mundo pero una parte importante de sus limitados recursos se destina a la construccin de armas nucleares y misiles balsticos actividad que est prohibida por el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU Como resultado la ONU ha impuesto onerosas sanciones al pas lo que ha hecho que su comercio sea altamente restrictivo Desde que lleg al poder hace 11 aos el lder de Corea del Norte Kim Jong Un ha supervisado una campaa sin precedentes de pruebas de armas incluidas cuatro pruebas nucleares y varios intentos provocativos de lanzamientos de prueba de misiles intercontinentales Fuente de la imagen KRTReuters Pie de foto El lder norcoreano Kim Jongun inspecciona ojivas nucleares Las autoridades estadounidenses creen que el gobierno de Corea del Norte est utilizando un grupo de piratas informticos de lite para entrar en bancos e instituciones financieras de todo el mundo para robar el dinero que necesita para mantener a flote su economa y financiar su programa de armas Se cree que los hackers apodados Grupo Lazarus pertenecen a una unidad dirigida por la poderosa agencia de inteligencia militar de Corea del Norte la Oficina General de Reconocimiento Los expertos en seguridad ciberntica nombraron a los hackers en honor a la figura bblica de Lzaro que regresa de entre los muertos porque una vez que sus virus ingresan a las redes informticas es casi imposible eliminarlos El grupo salt a la fama internacional por primera vez cuando el entonces presidente de EEUU Barack Obama acus a Corea del Norte de piratear la red informtica de Sony Pictures Entertainment en 2014 El FBI acus a los piratas informticos de realizar el daino ataque ciberntico en represalia por La entrevista una pelcula cmica que representaba el asesinato de Kim Jong Un Fuente de la imagen ROBYN BECK Pie de foto Un cartel publicitario de La entrevista despus de que Sony anunciara que cancelara el estreno navideo de la pelcula Desde entonces el Grupo Lazarus fue sido acusado de intentar robar US1000 millones del banco central de Bangladesh en 2016 y de lanzar el ataque ciberntico WannaCry que intent chantajear a organizaciones e individuos en todo el mundo incluido el Servicio Nacional de Salud de Reino Unido Corea del Norte niega enrgicamente la existencia del Grupo Lazarus y todas las acusaciones de piratera informtica patrocinada por el Estado Pero los principales organismos de seguridad afirman que los ataques de Corea del Norte son ms avanzados ms descarados y ms ambiciosos que nunca Para el robo del Cosmos los hackers utilizaron una tcnica conocida como jackpotting llamada as porque hace que el cajero automtico derrame su efectivo como ocurre al ganar en una mquina tragamonedas Los sistemas del banco fueron inicialmente comprometidos de la manera clsica a travs de un correo electrnico de phishing que abri un empleado e infect la red informtica con un programa maligno Una vez dentro los hackers manipularon el software el llamado interruptor de cajero automtico que enva mensajes a un banco para aprobar un retiro de efectivo Con esto los piratas informticos tenan poder para permitir los retiros en cajeros automticos de sus cmplices en cualquier parte del mundo Lo nico que no podan cambiar era la cantidad mxima para cada retiro por lo que necesitaban muchas tarjetas y mucha gente en el terreno En preparacin para el atraco trabajaron con cmplices para crear tarjetas de cajero automtico clonadas utilizando datos de cuentas bancarias genuinas para crear tarjetas duplicadas que se pueden usar en cajeros automticos La compaa de seguridad britnica BAE Systems sospech de inmediato que era obra del Grupo Lazarus Los haba estado monitoreando durante meses y saba que estaban conspirando para atacar un banco indio Simplemente no saba cul Hubiera sido demasiada coincidencia que fuera otra operacin criminal dice el investigador de seguridad de BAE Adrian Nish El Grupo Lazarus es verstil y muy ambicioso agrega La mayora de los grupos criminales probablemente estaran suficientemente felices salindose con la suya con un par de millones y detenerse ah La logstica involucrada en el atraco al Cosmos es asombrosa Cmo encontraron los piratas informticos cmplices en 28 pases incluidos muchos que los ciudadanos de Corea del Norte no pueden visitar legalmente Fuente de la imagen Getty images Pie de foto Los ciudadanos norcoreanos no pueden viajar libremente Los investigadores de seguridad tecnolgica de EEUU creen que el Grupo Lazarus conoci a un facilitador clave en la web oscura donde hay foros completos dedicados a intercambiar habilidades de piratera y donde los delincuentes a menudo venden servicios de apoyo En febrero de 2018 un usuario que se haca llamar Big Boss public consejos sobre cmo realizar fraudes con tarjetas de crdito Tambin dijo que tena el equipo para hacer tarjetas de cajero automtico clonadas y que tena acceso a un grupo de mulas de dinero en Estados Unidos y Canad Este era precisamente el servicio que necesitaba el Grupo Lazarus para su ataque al Banco Cosmos y comenzaron a trabajar con Big Boss Le pedimos a Mike DeBolt director de inteligencia de Intel 471 una firma de seguridad tecnolgica en los EEUU que obtuviera ms informacin sobre este cmplice El equipo de DeBolt descubri que Big Boss haba estado activo durante al menos 14 aos y tena una serie de alias G Habibi y Backwood Los detectives de seguridad lograron vincularlo con todos estos nombres de usuario ya que us la misma direccin de correo electrnico en diferentes foros Bsicamente est siendo perezoso afirma DeBolt Vemos esto con bastante frecuencia los actores cambian su alias en un foro pero mantienen la misma direccin de correo electrnico En 2019 Big Boss fue arrestado en Estados Unidos y desenmascarado como Ghaleb Alaumary un canadiense de 36 aos Se declar culpable de delitos que incluyen el lavado de fondos de presuntos atracos bancarios de Corea del Norte y fue sentenciado a 11 aos y ocho meses Corea del Norte nunca ha admitido ninguna participacin en el trabajo del Banco Cosmos o cualquier otro esquema de piratera La BBC present acusaciones de participacin en el ataque del Cosmos a la embajada de Corea del Norte en Londres pero no recibi respuesta Sin embargo cuando contactamos previamente al embajador Choe Il respondi que las acusaciones de piratera informtica y lavado de dinero patrocinados por el estado de Corea del Norte son una farsa y un intento de los EEUU de manchar la imagen de nuestro estado En febrero de 2021 el FBI el Servicio Secreto de EEUU y el Departamento de Justicia anunciaron cargos contra tres presuntos piratas informticos del Grupo Lazarus Jon Chang Hyok Kim Il y Park Jin Hyok quienes dijeron que trabajan para la agencia de inteligencia militar de Corea del Norte Ahora se cree que estn de vuelta en Pyongyang Fuente de la imagen DoJ Pie de foto Kim Il Park Jin Hyok y Jon Chang Hyok Las autoridades estadounidenses y surcoreanas estiman que Corea del Norte tiene hasta 7000 piratas informticos capacitados Es poco probable que todos trabajen desde el interior del pas donde pocas personas tienen permiso para usar internet lo que dificulta ocultar las actividades de los usuarios Ms bien a menudo son enviados al extranjero Ryu Hyeon Woo un exdiplomtico norcoreano y una de las personas ms importantes que abandonaron el rgimen brind informacin sobre cmo trabajan los piratas informticos en el extranjero En 2017 trabajaba en la embajada de Corea del Norte en Kuwait ayudando a supervisar el empleo de unos 10000 norcoreanos en la regin En ese momento muchos estaban trabajando en obras de construccin en todo el Golfo y como todos los trabajadores de Corea del Norte deban entregar la mayor parte de sus salarios al rgimen Dijo que su oficina reciba una llamada diaria de un encargado de Corea del Norte que supervisaba a 19 hackers que vivan y trabajaban en espacios reducidos en Dubi Eso es realmente todo lo que necesitan una computadora que est conectada a internet afirm Corea del Norte niega haber enviado piratas informticos al extranjero solo trabajadores informticos con visas vlidas Pero la descripcin de Ryu encaja con las acusaciones del FBI sobre cmo operan estas unidades cibernticas desde dormitorios en todo el mundo En septiembre de 2017 el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU impuso las sanciones ms estrictas hasta el momento a Corea del Norte limitando las importaciones de combustible restringiendo an ms las exportaciones y exigiendo que los pases miembros de la ONU enviaran a los trabajadores norcoreanos a su pas para diciembre de 2019 Sin embargo los piratas informticos todava parecen estar activos Ahora estn apuntando a empresas de criptomonedas y se estima que han robado cerca de US3200 millones Las autoridades estadounidenses los han llamado los principales ladrones de bancos del mundo que utilizan teclados en lugar de armas Fuente de la imagen Getty

DNA reveals,A new ancient DNA study help confirm but also contradict and complicate the historical narrative that Swahilis paired up with Persians 1000 years ago in East Africa,About a millennium ago long before the age of internet dating Swahili women in eastern Africa paired up with a new type of suitor men from Persia a new study finds Researchers made the finding  4624 chars,Traditional Swahili culture had a matriarchal nature when Persian men married into the culture about 1000 years ago The Swahili retailed this matriarchal feature during colonial rule and modern times Here we see two Swahili women in Zanzibar circa 1890 About a millennium ago long before the age of internet dating Swahili women in eastern Africa paired up with a new type of suitor men from Persia a new study finds Researchers made the finding by studying the ancient DNA of 80 aristocrats buried in six medieval and early modern towns along the Swahili coast they wrote in a new study published March 29 in the journal Nature opens in new tab These international hookups occurred just as Islam was spreading to the Swahili region the researchers noted The study supports historical evidence that Swahili aristocrats are descendants of Persians who married Africans centuries ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale coauthors Chapurukha Kusimba opens in new tab professor of anthropology at University of South Florida and David Reich opens in new tab professor of genetics and human evolutionary biology at Harvard University wrote in The Conversation opens in new tab Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them This tomb site along the Swahili Coast in East Africa is one of the places where scientists uncovered ancient DNA from the Swahili elite Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida The Swahili civilization has existed for thousands of years along the coast of East Africa where they played a key role in the trade routes connecting Africa Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China Swahili people embraced Islam a little more than 1000 years ago fell under colonialist control in the 1500s and did not regain their independence until the mid 20th century The Swahili people were then largely absorbed into modern Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar The question of where the Swahili came from originally and how their unique culture evolved has been subject to debate among academics for at least a century Not all of these debates were carried out in good faith Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Kusimba and Reich wrote Related Polynesians and Native Americans paired up 800 years ago DNA reveals The new study shows that the story of the Swahili is neither straightforward nor far off from the civilizations own legends Anthropologist Chapurukha Kusimba from the University of South Florida made it his life mission to research the Swahili culture After receiving approval from the people of Swahili Kusimba was able to excavate cemetery remains Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida Upon examining the DNA of the medieval Swahili elite some of whom lived up to 800 years ago the scientists discovered that the majority of male ancestors came from Asia  particularly Persia or modernday Iran  while the majority of female ancestors came from Africa These findings bring out the African contributions and indeed the Africanness of the Swahili without marginalizing the Persian and Indian connection Kusimba said in a statement opens in new tab Further the Persians do not appear to have forced their ideologies upon their African partners Oral traditions and archaeological evidence suggest that the descendants of these AsianAfrican unions spoke an African language and that African women retained significant economic and social power The researchers suspect that the traditional matriarchal society of the Swahili was by then so entrenched that even the traditionally patriarchal Persian men followed local custom so that they could marry into powerful African families The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coasts African matriarchal traditions confirms that this was not a simple history of African women being exploited Kusimba and Reich wrote,science,The story of the Swahili is neither straightforward nor far off from the own legends Anthropologist

pi ricche del mondo hanno pessime abitudini nella scelta e gestione delle proprie password A rivelarlo una ricerca di NordPass  da anni che gli esperti di cybers 5584 chars,Anche i dipendenti delle aziende pi ricche del mondo hanno pessime abitudini nella scelta e gestione delle proprie password A rivelarlo una ricerca di NordPass  da anni che gli esperti di cybersecurity ripetono limportanza di scegliere password solide in particolar modo allinterno di contesti aziendali Ma i dipendenti delle societ pi importanti del mondo continuano a ritenere sufficienti credenziali banali come 123456 e password Da un certo punto di vista sembra paradossale che le societ pi ricche del pianeta con tutte le risorse necessarie per investire in cybersecurity si rivelino cos superficiali nella scelta e nella gestione delle password Da unaltra prospettiva per questo fenomeno dimostra ancora una volta che le cattive abitudini sono profondamente radicate in un numero sorprendente di utenti Questa ricerca ribadisce quanto sia importante velocizzare la transizione verso sistemi di autenticazione online alternativi ha dichiarato Jonas Karklys amministratore delegato di NordPass Anche se lanalisi di NordPass sulluso delle password da parte degli utenti di internet non si interrompe mai questanno lazienda ha deciso di concentrarsi nel dettaglio sulle password utilizzate dai dipendenti delle societ pi grandi del mondo da 31 Paesi diversi per proteggere gli account aziendali I ricercatori hanno quindi compilato una lista contenente le 20 password pi utilizzate per ogni settore industriale qui i dettagli Dummies sexy4sho e altre password particolari Secondo lo studio password e 123456 rispettivamente al primo e secondo posto nella classifica delle password pi usate al mondo dellanno scorso vanno per la maggiore anche nelle aziende pi importanti Nei 20 settori analizzati entrambe le password sono rientrate nella classifica delle 7 scelte pi utilizzate In alcuni settori si nota anche una creativit maggiore rispetto ad altri La password dummies  al sesto posto fra i dipendenti del settore dei beni di consumo sexy4sho traducibile in sicuramentesexy  al 16 posto fra quelli del settore immobiliare mentre snowman pupazzo di neve  all11 nel settore energetico E a quanto pare chi lavora nel settore finanziario sembra avere un bisogno urgente di staccare la spina perch le password pi utilizzate sono ready2go pronto a partire vacation vacanza e summer estate La musa ispiratrice delle password Cos come succede fra gli utenti standard le parole del dizionario nomi di persone e Paesi o semplici combinazioni di numeri lettere e simboli sono fra le chiavi pi comuni rilevate da questa ricerca Detto questo il rimanente 32 indica unaltra tendenza interessante I dipendenti delle compagnie pi ricche del mondo adorano le password che fanno riferimento diretto o indiretto al nome di unazienda La ragione sociale il nome di dominio usato dalle password aziendali parte del nome della ditta una sua abbreviazione il nome di un prodotto o di una societ controllata sono fra le fonti di ispirazione pi comuni Password di questo tipo sono al tempo stesso fragili e pericolose Questo perch gli hacker provano spesso password contenenti il nome aziendale per accedere in maniera illecita a sistemi di societ specifiche Non  un caso lesperienza suggerisce che password di questo tipo sono fra le pi comuni I dipendenti spesso evitano di usare credenziali complesse in particolar modo negli account condivisi Per questo motivo si trovano spesso a optare per scelte troppo semplici magari influenzate dal nome dellazienda ha continuato Karklys Numeri e ampiezza dello studio Lanalisi delle password delle aziende pi ricche al mondo  stata condotta in partnership con ricercatori indipendenti specializzati in incidenti di cybersecurity Sono state prese in considerazione le 500 societ pi importanti per capitalizzazione a rappresentare 31 Paesi e 20 settori industriali Stati Uniti 462 Cina 96 Giappone 58 India 42 Regno Unito 4 Francia 38 e Canada 36 sono stati i Paesi pi rappresentati in questa ricerca Per quanto riguarda invece i settori pi coinvolti si possono citare finanziario tecnologico e sanitario Le password sono destinate a morire Lo studio  lultimo di una serie di progetti legati alle password condotti da NordPass negli anni Nel 2021 sono state analizzate le password usate nelle aziende Fortune 500 mentre nel 2022 loggetto dellinvestigazione erano state le password dei manager aziendali pi importanti Ogni anno Nord Pass presenta anche la ricerca delle 200 password pi usate che offre uno sguardo dinsieme sulle tendenze principali in questo ambito Se i trend variano ogni anno a seconda del tipo di pubblico considerato in generale si pu notare come le persone continuino a gestire male le proprie password Sembra chiara la necessit di nuove soluzioni per lautenticazione online come le passkey ha sottolineato Karklys Aziende note per limpegno verso linnovazione come Google Microsoft Apple PayPal KAYAK ed eBay hanno gi adottato questa tecnologia offrendo soluzioni di accesso senza password ai propri utenti Secondo Karklys a breve saranno molte altre le aziende online che seguiranno questo percorso NordPass ha sviluppato una sua soluzione per conservare e gestire le passkey dei propri clienti e riferisce di stare sviluppando un nuovo strumento per le aziende che permetta di integrare in modo facile e intuitivo le passkey allinterno dei propri siti Secondo un report di IBM nel 2022 il furto delle credenziali ha continuato a

entertainment kites have also been utilized to distribute propaganda emit radio signals ward off supernatural forces and spy on others Today most people fly kites for pleasure and fun What you might not know is that in the wrong hands kites are extremely dangerous Data reveals that dozens of individuals are injured each year some even killed by kites One festival alone that occurred in India in January 2023 saw three children lose their lives and another 176 injured What follows are 10 of the most noteworthy times that people were killed when or by flying kites Related 10 Incredibly Tragic Unsolved Child Murders 10 An Indian Boy Electrocuted In Sangareddy India on January 12 2023 a boy and his friends climbed on top of a roof to fly kites The roof belonged to the rented house where one of the boys lived Unfortunately one of the boys flew his kite too close and touched a power line This led the boy to incur severe burns The boy then made the unwise mistake of attempting to remove the kite He later passed away at a nearby medical center The boy is reported to have received burns on over 90 percent of his body while the other two incurred 30 percent burns to their bodies Indias transmission voltage is 765 kV AC the highest voltage power lines can carry and the equivalent of 115000 volts Shocks above 2700 volts are often fatal while shocks above 11000 volts are usually fatal However it is the amount of current the amperes more so than the voltage that determines the outcome 1 9 Man Falls to Death Flying Kite In 2021 a 44yearold man had an unfortunate experience flying a kite The man was flying kites with his neighbors during a Sankranti celebration in Hyderabad India when he fell at least four stories The mishap occurred when the man neared the edge of the buildings terrace and lost his balance It is believed he was not aware that he was so close to the edge Unfortunately the man fell onto the metal gate surrounding the building dying on the scene before he could be transported to the hospital Following the accident the police commissioner requested that people stop flying kites from elevated places The commissioner also requested that parents instruct children not to run into dangerous areas like busy roads while trying to gather kites For context six stories range from 60 to 90 feet 183 to 274 meters tall While people flying kites often survive falls from 20 to 25 feet 61 to 76 meters the greater the height after that the more likely a fatality is to occur One study determined that falls from eight stories 98 feet or 299 meters are almost always deadly2 8 Man Electrocuted by Kite String Indias National Green Tribunal in July 2017 placed a complete prohibition on manja a nonbiodegradable kite string material made of nylon or other synthetics that prove harmful to animals birds and humans Two months later a 33yearold man who resided in eastern India failed to heed this regulation The man was flying a kite from the terrace of his home when it became entangled in hightension wire The manja had been partially made with glass and metal dust and proved to be a good conductor when it became caught up in a 33000volt power line The late mans son who was holding the string experienced shock and was thrown immediately backward The late man who owned a stationery shop owner was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries The mans daughter nephew and niece were also injured while attempting to move the mans hand away from the kite string3 7 Boy Dies after Fall from Giant Kite A fiveyearold boy in Vietnam passed away in 2015 after becoming caught in the ropes belonging to a giant kite The boy was then pulled into the air before falling 65 feet 20 meters to the ground Video recording captures the terrifying moment where onlookers could only watch in terror The kite took off into the air so fast that no one could save him The boy was freed when several of the kite strings snapped After being taken to the hospital the boy was pronounced dead The boy wandered off from his mother while members of the Saigon Kite Club tried to launch the large kite which contained a replica of the Vietnamese flag and was reported to have been almost 50 feet 15 meters wide A woman reported that the kite fell to the ground several times before it was launched by the wind When taking off the kite knocked down a table and a few chairs near the booth where the boys mother was working The boy is believed to have come close to the kite to retrieve soft drink bottles when he became caught up in the kite strings4 6 Giant Japanese Kite Kills One In 2015 a crowd in Higashiomi Japan watched as a more than 1000pound 453kilogram kite fell from the sky and wounded four individuals One of the men injured by the falling kite died from his injuries Spectators claimed that the kite showed instability within minutes of being airborne One commentator said that the kite tilted to the side and then came crashing to the ground while spectators hurried to find a safe place On the day the mishap occurred a weather report was issued for a strong wind warning Three others were injured in the incident including two elderly men and a young boy The annual Higashiomi Giant Kite Festival involves large kites made from bamboo and paper To make matters even more surprising this marked the second deadly accident involving a giant kite that occurred in Japan in a tenweek period5 5 Boy Dies after Falling into Gutter While Flying Kite In 2023 a boy in Cuttack India wandered out of his house without telling anyone While flying his kite the child fell into an open drain in the Bidanasi part of town and died At the time the boy left the house his family was sitting around watching television Due to their failure to stop the boy from falling into the drain the Cuttack Municipal Corporation officials later blamed the family for the boys death Construction work on the drain had stopped two months earlier but authorities left the drain open at several points If the Municipal Corporation had covered the drain with concrete slabs the accident would never have occurred This was not the only time that someone was harmed by falling into an open drain that month A few weeks earlier a South Korean journalist fell into an open drain in Bhubaneswar India while enjoying a cup of tea at a roadside stall6 4 Mumbai Boys Throat Slit Also in 2023 a boy in Mumbai India was taking in the sights from his familys sunroof while the vehicle traveled down the MumbaiAhmedabad National Highway to his familys vacation home Also traveling in the vehicle were the boys mother father sister and grandparents Suddenly the boy was injured when a kite string became wrapped around his neck At the time of the accident the vehicle was traveling at a moderate speed and very close to the familys destination The boy was promptly taken to the hospital with profuse bleeding The boys mother a doctor and another hospital physician tried to put pressure on the wound Still the boy passed away from his injuries The kite string that took the boys life was composed of nylon What the boy did not know was that same day very close to him a girl had lost her life in the same way while also looking out of a sunroof7 3 11 Killed at Pakistan Kite Festival Hundreds defy banned Pakistan kite flying festival  BBC News Watch this video on YouTube Eleven people were killed and over 100 injured at an annual spring festival in eastern Pakistan The festival is routinely celebrated with many bright kites Besides stray celebratory bullets other people were killed by kite strings electrocution caused by kites and falling off rooftops while flying kites Many kite flyers in Pakistan attempt to use wire or other sharp kite strings made from ground glass to try to cut rival kite strings or harm other kite flyers This can lead to substantial injuries and deaths for birds people and other animals though Pakistani police arrested more than 700 people for using dangerous kite strings or firing weapons during the festival Law enforcement also seized 282 illegally held weapons In 2006 Pakistani authorities even placed a temporary ban on kite flying following a series of festival deaths As a result of the ban the police arrested over 1000 people for selling or making harmful kite strings Following these 11 fatalities the ban was understandably reimposed 8 2 Man Riding Motorbike Killed by Kite String At the beginning of 2023 a man in Surat India riding a motorbike was killed when a stray kite string slit his neck At the time of the mishap the man was on his way home after work at a power loom factory at a diamond industrial estate Police reported that the man incurred substantial injuries to his throat and neck but

experienced a heart attack and a brain injury When ambulance workers arrived at the scene they found the man unconscious and not breathing The man was later pronounced dead Kite flying associations often suggest the highest degree of caution when flying stuntkites due to the substantial pull lift and speed Additionally UK laws prohibit flying kites greater than 197 feet 60 meters above the ground without the Civil Aviation Authoritys permission These safety precautions however did not stop the man10 fact checked by Darci Heikkinen,science,Kites are one of the most common objects to be

are a horrific consequence of climate change,In the opening scenes of The Ministry for the Future the novelist Kim Stanley Robinson imagines what happens to a small Indian town hit by a heatwave Streets empty as normal activity becomes imposs 10147 chars,I n the opening scenes of The Ministry for the Future the novelist Kim Stanley Robinson imagines what happens to a small Indian town hit by a heatwave Streets empty as normal activity becomes impossible Airconditioned rooms fill with silent fugitives from the heat Rooftops are littered with the corpses of people sleeping outside in search of a nonexistent breath of wind The electricity grid then law and order break down Like a medieval vision of hell the local lake fills with halfpoached bodies Across north India 20m die in a week Mr Robinson said he wrote his bestseller published in 2020 as a warning The IndoGangetic Plain which extends from the spine of Pakistan through northern India to the deltas of Bangladesh is home to 700m people and exceptionally vulnerable to the heat pulses that climate change is making more frequent It is one of the hottest poorest and most populous places on earth see map Its electricity grids are unreliable Between 2000 and 2019 South Asia saw over 110000 excess deaths a year due to rising temperatures according to a study in Lancet Planetary Health a journal Last years hot season which runs from March until the arrival of the monsoon in late May or early June was one of the most extreme and economically disruptive on record This years could rival it India has just experienced its hottest December and February since 1901 In March the India Meteorological Department  IMD  and its counterpart in Pakistan  PMD  warned of aboveaverage temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May On March 6th Narendra Modi Indias prime minister chaired a review on hot season preparedness Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority has kicked off a countrywide simulation to test emergency responses to the flooding that can follow extreme heat Despite a relatively cool March the coming weeks could be perilously hot On April 1st Mrutyunjay Mohapatra IMD s chief sounded the alarm again Scientists record heat stress as a combination of temperature and humidity known as a wetbulb measurement As this combined level approaches body temperature 37C it becomes increasing hard for mammals to shed heat through perspiration At a wetbulb temperature of around 31C dangerously little sweat can evaporate into the souplike air Brain damage and heart and kidney failure become increasingly likely Sustained exposure to a temperature of 35C the level Mr Robinson imagines in his book is considered fatal The IndoGangetic Plain is one of the few places where wetbulb temperatures of 35C have been recorded including on several occasions in the scorched Pakistani town of Jacobabad A report by the World Bank in November warned that India could become one of the first places where wetbulb temperatures routinely exceed the 35C survivability threshold The regular temperature last year peaked in Jacobabad which sits at the border of Pakistans provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at 51C Half the towns population of 200000 had by then fled in search of more bearable temperatures Even after the temperature began to ease in early June it was hard to resume regular activity Ali Bahar a dailywage labourer in Jacobabad recalls trying and failing to work in its surrounding fields in June While driving a tractor in 42C heat he felt feverish and dizzy then tumbled from the machine injuring his head Coworkers carried him to a local clinic which dished out the standard treatment of a packet of orangeflavoured rehydration salts Though he was discharged six hours later he was unable to work for a week The temperature record provides a horrifying account of the changes afoot According to the definition of a heatwave used by Indias weather agency which takes into account average annual local temperatures and the duration of the anomaly India saw on average 235 heatwaves every year in the two decades to 2019 more than double the annual average of 99 it saw between 1980 and 1999 Between 2010 and 2019 the incidence of heatwaves in India grew by a quarter compared to the previous decade with a corresponding increase in heatrelated mortality of 27 During last years hot season India experienced twice as many heatwave days as in the same period in 2012 the previous record year Climate change made last years heat pulse 30 times likelier than it would otherwise have been according to World Weather Attribution a global research collaboration That is both because it has raised Indias average annual temperatureby around 07C between 1900 and 2018and because it has made anomalous heat surges bigger and more frequent The magnifying effect of the built urban environment which can be 2C hotter than nearby rural areas is often especially pronounced in Indias concrete jungles Those living in slum housing which offer little air circulation and often use heatsucking materials such as tin suffer the worst of it If the climate warms by 2C compared with preindustrial levels as appears unavoidable such events would be more likely by an additional factor of 220 Even if the world makes more headway on curbing greenhousegas emissions than looks likely vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience wetbulb temperature episodes exceeding 31C which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans according to a paper by Elfatih Eltahir of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colleagues The costs of crippling heat are already vast Even working in the shade on an average summer day in Delhi results in labour losses of 1520 minutes per hour at the hottest times reckons Luke Parsons of Duke University in North Carolina Mr Parsons and colleagues have estimated that India loses 101bn man hours per year to extreme heat and Pakistan 13bn During last years withering hot season the wheat harvest was down by around 15 in both countriesand in some regions by as much as 30 Livestock perished The normal agricultural day became impossible Electricity outages in part caused by increased demand for cooling shut down industry and worse airconditioning India saw blackouts even in pampered cities such as Delhi the capital Schooldays were cancelled or curtailed A study in 2020 by McKinsey Global Institute  MGI  a corporate thinktank estimates that the loss of workinghours to extreme heat in India has risen from 10 of the maximum total before 1980 to 15 today Models suggest that proportion will double by 2030 The effect is hugely exacerbated by how labourintensive India and other hot and poor places are see chart In 2017 heatexposed work accounted for 50 of Indias GDP and employed 75 of the labour force or some 380m By 2030 reckons MGI such work will still make up 40 of GDP and the rising number of lost work hours could put at risk 2545 of GDP or 150250bn Pakistan could lose 659 of GDP due to climate change the World Bank warned last year as increased floods and heatwaves reduce agriculture and livestock yields destroy infrastructure sap labour productivity and undermine health What short of reversing global warming can be done Administrators in Ahmedabad a city in Indias western state of Gujarat offer a guide In 2010 it suffered a heatwave that killed 800 people in a week This was a shocking figure says Dileep Mavalankar As director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar Gujarats capital he helped Ahmedabad design Indias first heat action plan  hap  It recommended several simple but effective measures for example warn people of extreme temperatures advise them to stay indoors and drink lots of water and put emergency services on high alert Today there are estimated to be more than 100 such plans in Indias cities districts and states Karachi Pakistans commercial capital developed a similar plan after a heatwave in the city in 2015 killed 1300 people These steps probably contributed to a surprisingly low death toll during last years extended heatwave Early estimates identified only 90 deaths in India attributable to it The true number was probably much greater but may well have been lower than the 4000 who died on the IndoGangetic Plain from a heatwave in 2015 The fact that last years heatwave was exceptional places such as Jacobabad aside not particularly humid was probably the main reason for this It is also the case that poor places used to intense heat are better at adapting to it than illaccustomed rich ones Some hap s are better than others A new study by the Centre for Policy Research a thinktank in Delhi found that many oversimplified heat hazards by ignoring the role of humidity failed to target vulnerable groups and lacked adequate financing Provisions for forecasting heatwaves are also variable Indias IMD issues a daily heat bulletin with fiveday colourcoded forecasts Pakistan is much further behind The PMD is creaky in technology says Sherry Rehman the countrys minister for climate change To be better prepared we will need better forecasting abilities The two countries would do better by cooperating says the UN They will both increasingly be called on to take much costlier measures such as designing cold shelters rethinking urban planning and building materials and bailing out those unable to work in the heat We are going to have to learn to live in a warmer world says Gabriel Vecchi a scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey The question is how orderly costly or calamitous that learning process will be It is hard to find much comfort in the underlying facts Year by year parts of the poor and crowded IndoGangetic Plain will become increasingly unlivable for days or weeks on end Even the most capable government would struggle to prevent that leading to catastrophe And Indias much less Pakistans is not the most capable This is in fact where Mr Robinsons dystopian novel goes off the rails He imagines the heatwave he describes spurring transformative climate action around the world That was ludicrously unrealistic concluded Francis Fukuyama a political scientist Yet without such action it is hard to see what will stop one of the most dire promises of global warming becoming a horrifying reality ,science,South Asia has just experienced its hottest December and February since 1901 and the coming weeks could be perilously hot.

ramp up production This is a welcome development as we really need to get electric vehicles to as many markets as soon as practically possible to help supercharge the transition away from fossil fuel powered vehicles One of the leading companies in the EV space is BYD BYD sold just under 190000 EVs in 2020 And in only two years it managed to 10 this to over 1863494 vehicles last year 10 in 2 years how cool is that In that time BYD stopped making full ICE vehicles to focus only on battery electrics and plugin hybrids Its plugin hybrids have also been upgraded with the new models  their Super Hybrid DMi and DMp models This year BYD is planning to sell 36 million EVs which is double the number of EVs it sold last year This would be an incredible achievement should BYD manage it To show how big a deal this would be if the company manages to achieve this in 2020 just over 3 million EVs were sold worldwide from all automakers Now just two years later BYD alone will smash this number by a huge margin Although the majority of these sales will be in BYDs home market a decent chunk of the sales are expected to come from its accelerated push to open up in new markets around the world BYD has been on a roll announcing the entry into new markets on a seemingly weekly basis now BYD has launched some of its new BEVs in several markets around the world including India Thailand Australia Austria New Zealand Cambodia Nepal Laos and Singapore You can even get select passenger and commercial vehicles from BYD in Zimbabwe Kenya and other places on the African continent All of this recent expansion goes to show that a lot of planning has gone into this new aggressive export drive BYD has added yet another new market BYD has launched the Tang SUV Han flagship sedan and the Yuan Plus in Mexico It seems we get these announcements every week now Speaking at the launch Zou Zhou Country Manager of BYD Mexico said To start the passenger vehicle business in Mexico is a dream BYD has been pursuing for years and the dream has come true today Interestingly BYD is continuing with the name Yuan Plus in Mexico just as it is called in China and not going with the name ATTO 3 which has been used in other markets particularly in Europe New Zealand Australia Japan and other Asian nations This is probably because it is also called the Yuan Plus in Colombia and other places in South and Central America and the name was already known in that region from the previous ICE and hybrid versions The data sheet on BYD Mexicos website shows two options for the Yuan Plus the 4992 kWh and 6048 kWh versions BYD Blade Battery with 410 km and 480 km NEDC range respectively BYD also says that the Yuan Plus is a spacious Csegment SUV combining modern aesthetics with exceptional intelligence and efficiency derived from pioneering electric vehicle technology and smart connectivity It has been designed by Wolfgang Egger with the European customer in mind providing a stylish funinspired choice complete with very high levels of standard equipment Reports say the Yuan Plus will start from around 44000 The data sheet on BYD Mexicos websites shows the Tang SUV AWD with a 864 kWh Blade Battery 66 kW AC charging and 110 kW DC charging Reports say the Tang SUV will start from around 78000 The data sheet on BYD Mexicos website also show that the flagship Han sedan AWD has a 854kWh Blade Battery as well as 66kW AC and 110kW DC charging The Han starts from around 76000 BYD also recently partnered with Banco Santander Mexico for vehicle financing Through this strategic cooperation BYD is enabled to provide local consumers with a full range of auto finance solutions Specifically this partnership seeks to facilitate access to all new energy BYD vehicles to customers and noncustomers of the bank with an offer of a 10 down payment and financing of up to 72 months in addition to plans with 0 commission for opening Zhou Zou Country Manager of BYD Mexico said Our strategic cooperation with Santander aims to provide local consumers with firstclass auto finance services and solutions and reduce the financial risks of dealers and customers promoting the transformation to green mobility At Santander we continue to seek new partnerships to make it easier for our customers to acquire vehicles On this occasion we are pleased to go hand in hand with BYD said Julio Ascorve Zermeo CEO of Automotive Financing at Santander Mexico By financing these vehicles we contribute to reducing emissions which gives us an important edge in line with our values of sustainability and commitment to the environment So we have seen two big launches from BYD this week One in Spain and one in Mexico Im looking forward to finding out which markets are next on BYDs radar BYD is also looking to expand its passenger vehicle assembly and manufacturing footprint outside of China Earlier this month BYD started constructing a plant in Thailand that will produce 150000 vehicles per year There have been reports of discussions around setting up a factory in Brazil Perhaps Mexico could be another market BYD can look into seriously and expedite setting up a plant there BYD currently offers the more affordable compact hatchback the Dolphin in select markets The Dolphin was recently spotted testing in Australia and hopefully it will go on sale there soon as well as in other markets in Europe Another small vehicle coming soon from BYD is the BYD Seagull The BYD Seagull is expected to be priced close to 10000 in China This is a great price for a car with a 30 kWh battery a 55 kW motor and a top speed of 130 kmh It will also have a 38 kWh version It goes on sale in China later this month It is these types of small affordable EVs that will accelerate the adoption of electric mobility around the world Images courtesy of BYD I dont like paywalls You dont like paywalls Who likes paywalls Here at CleanTechnica we implemented a limited paywall for a while but it always felt wrong  and it was always tough to decide what we should put behind there In theory your most exclusive and best content goes behind a paywall But then fewer people read it We just dont like paywalls and so weve decided to ditch ours Unfortunately the media business is still a tough cutthroat business with tiny margins Its a neverending Olympic challenge to stay above water or even perhaps  gasp  grow So ,science,In this series of articles I will be looking at some of the major players in the electric vehicle space.

en cuenta El mundo podra superar los 15 grados de calentamiento por primera vez El Nio podra por primera vez hacer que el mundo supere los 15 grados centgrados de calentamiento por encima de los niveles preindustriales de mediados a finales del siglo XIX Los pases se comprometieron en el Acuerdo Climtico de Pars a limitar el calentamiento global a menos de 2 grados y preferiblemente a 15 grados en comparacin con las temperaturas preindustriales Los cientficos consideran que 15 grados de calentamiento es un punto de inflexin clave ms all del cual las posibilidades de inundaciones extremas sequas incendios forestales y escasez de alimentos podran aumentar drsticamente Un fenmeno de El Nio fuerte podra empujar al planeta a ese punto dijo Scaife aunque solo sea temporalmente Probablemente tendremos en 2024 el ao ms clido registrado a nivel mundial dijo a CNN Josef Ludescher cientfico principal del Instituto Potsdam para la Investigacin del Impacto Climtico El ao ms clido registrado actualmente es 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte El mundo ya ha visto aproximadamente 12 grados de calentamiento ya que los humanos continan quemando combustibles fsiles y produciendo contaminacin que calienta el planeta Y a pesar de los tres aos de enfriamiento de La Nia las temperaturas se han disparado a niveles peligrosos Europa sufri su verano ms caluroso en 2022 con temperaturas superiores a los 40 grados Celsius 104 Fahrenheit y Pakistn e India experimentaron una ola de calor abrasador donde partes del pas alcanzaron ms de 49 grados Celsius 120 Fahrenheit En ltima instancia si se alcanza el umbral de 15 grados o se pasa por alto por poco realmente no importa dijo Scaife Es la primera vez en la historia de la humanidad que ese valor est al alcance y ese es el punto realmente significativo Cualquiera que sea el nivel exacto de calentamiento que trae El Nio es muy probable que algunos de sus impactos incluidas las temperaturas extremas no tengan precedentes dijo Scaife Cada vez que tenemos un El Nio se suma a una cantidad cada vez mayor de calentamiento global que hemos acumulado Podra haber ms lluvia que rompa la sequa en el oeste California ha visto una avalancha de lluvia y nieve en los ltimos meses Eso podra intensificarse durante El Nio California ya enfrenta amenazas potenciales de inundaciones esta primavera inform la NOAA en marzo despus de que cayera nieve sin precedentes en la Sierra y lluvias torrenciales empaparan el resto del estado Una vez que El Nio entre en accin es probable que gran parte del estado sufra una mayor probabilidad de precipitaciones por encima de lo normal con un mayor riesgo de inundaciones deslizamientos de tierra y erosin costera dijeron expertos a CNN Incluso podra brindar un alivio significativo de la sequa a la cuenca del ro Colorado dijo Brad Rippey meteorlogo del Departamento de Agricultura de Estados Unidos Mientras que La Nia es histricamente un generador de sequa para Estados Unidos continentales El Nio es un rompedor de sequa dijo Rippey a CNN Aunque la ubicacin exacta de la sequa o la falta de ella vara considerablemente de un evento a otro La situacin en el ro Colorado que proporciona agua para beber riego y electricidad a aproximadamente 40 millones de personas en todo el suroeste se ha visto afectada por el uso excesivo y una sequa provocada por el cambio climtico La crisis del agua se ha vuelto tan grave que el gobierno federal anunci cortes de agua obligatorios nunca antes vistos en los ltimos dos aos Jon Gottschalck pronosticador jefe del Centro de Prediccin Climtica de la NOAA ampli la idea de Rippey y seal que una corriente en chorro ms fuerte y extendida del Pacfico corrientes de aire de flujo rpido en la atmsfera superior que influyen en el tiempo del da a da podra elevar las probabilidades de ros atmosfricos para la costa oeste al mismo tiempo que causa precipitaciones ms intensas en el sur Sequa calor y fuego en otros lugares En otras partes del mundo El Nio podra amplificar las sequas las feroces olas de calor y los peligrosos incendios forestales Sudfrica e India corren el riesgo de sequa y calor extremo al igual que las naciones cercanas al Pacfico occidental incluidas Indonesia Australia y las naciones insulares del Pacfico como Vanuatu y Fiji Para Australia que an se recupera de las extensas inundaciones es probable que El Nio traiga un clima mucho ms seco y clido especialmente en las reas orientales del pas Desde 1900 18 de los 27 aos de El Nio han significado una sequa generalizada de invierno y primavera dijo a CNN un portavoz de la Oficina de Meteorologa de Australia Sus recientes inundaciones tambin han aumentado los temores de una temporada de incendios forestales particularmente destructiva ya que el incremento del crecimiento de la vegetacin podra proporcionar combustible para los incendios a medida que el clima se vuelve ms seco y clido India tambin se prepara para los impactos de El Nio que puede debilitar el monzn que trae las lluvias de las que depende para llenar los acuferos y los cultivos El monzn tiende a verse ms afectado cuando hay un cambio de un invierno de La Nia que acabamos de ver a un verano de El Nio que es probable que sea el verano de 2023 dijo Raghu Murtugudde cientfico de sistemas de la Tierra en la Universidad de Maryland El dficit general de lluvias monznicas puede llegar al 15 dijo a CNN El Nio tambin podra hacer subir las temperaturas en India que ya experimenta olas de calor inusualmente tempranas Es un peligro compuesto porque las olas de calor y El Nio tienden a retrasar el inicio del monzn dijo Kieren Hunt cientfica investigadora de la Universidad de Reading en Inglaterra Meses de perodos secos supondran una enorme presin sobre la seguridad del agua afirm Un ocano Pacfico ms clido equivale a ciclones ms fuertes Una de las primeras huellas dactilares de El Nio segn Gottschalck ser evidente en los cambios en la actividad de los ciclones tropicales A diferencia de La Nia El Nio tiende a reducir la actividad de los huracanes en el Atlntico pero crea el efecto contrario en el Pacfico donde las aguas clidas pueden generar tifones ms intensos Los ciclones tropicales a menudo pueden formarse ms al oeste en la cuenca y permanecer ms fuertes por ms tiempo por lo que aumentan los impactos potenciales en Hawai dijo Gottschalck Esto significa ms posibilidades de tocar tierra e impactos impulsados de forma remota como mares ms fuertes y de mayor duracin fuertes lluvias y ms En otras partes del Pacfico Swain dijo que los modelos muestran aguas muy clidas frente a la costa de Per que ya generan precipitaciones inusualmente fuertes e inundaciones en los desiertos Ese es un precursor clsico de un evento significativo de El Nio A medida que El Nio se forme y se fortalezca a finales de este ao Per podra correr un riesgo an mayor de sufrir ms inundaciones El gobierno ya est listo para invertir ms de US 1000 millones en medidas climticas y meteorolgicas para prevenir lo peor Los arrecifes de coral podran sufrir un blanqueamiento catastrfico El Nio es un calentador de ocanos y el agua ms clida es una mala noticia para los arrecifes de coral Cuando se calientan demasiado los corales escupen las algas que viven dentro de su tejido lo que les proporciona tanto su color como la mayor parte de su energa Esto hace que los corales se vuelvan blancos en un fenmeno llamado blanqueamiento Si bien pueden recuperarse si las temperaturas eventualmente bajan el blanqueamiento los pone en mayor riesgo de inanicin y muerte Un perodo particularmente catastrfico de blanqueamiento de corales ocurri entre 2014 y 2017 afectando a todos los arrecifes importantes de la Tierra La Gran Barrera de Coral de Australia registr la muerte de casi el 30 de sus corales en una ola de calor marina rcord en 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte que comenz en 2015 Ms eventos de blanqueamiento masivo continuaron y con El Nio en el horizonte los cientficos estn cada vez ms preocupados por los impactos en el coral que simplemente no ha tenido tiempo suficiente para recuperarse Lo que se predice aqu da mucho miedo dijo Peter Houk profesor del Laboratorio Marino de la Universidad de Guam que estudia el coral en Micronesia Cada vez que viene uno crece un poco ms en intensidad El Nio no significa necesariamente que todo el coral se ver afectado dijo Houk Cada El Nio es diferente y siempre hay otros patrones climticos naturales en juego Pero cuando sucede es brutal asegur Cuando llegue El Nio ser una oportunidad para aprender ms sobre cmo reacciona el coral y dnde pueden aparecer focos de resiliencia dijo Houk Solo quiere que aguante un poco ms Esperamos que las predicciones sean incorrectas y luego podamos comprar algunos aos ms para que los corales se recuperen Ms hielo derretido en la Antrtida El hielo antrtico ya est en problemas y El Nio podra empeorarlo A principios de este ao los niveles de hielo en el continente descendieron a mnimos histricos por segunda vez en dos aos lo que provoc el temor de que despus de aos de altibajos ahora podra estar en una fuerte tendencia a la baja El Nio podra ayudar a acelerar este proceso segn una investigacin reciente que encontr un vnculo entre la fuerza y la frecuencia de los eventos de El Nio y la velocidad del derretimiento del hielo antrtico Los modelos que proyectan un mayor aumento de El Nio producen sistemticamente un derretimiento de la capa de hielo ms rpido que los modelos que proyectan un cambio menor en El Nio dijo a CNN Wenju Cai cientfico investigador jefe de CSIRO la agencia cientfica nacional de Australia Los cientficos vigilan de cerca a la Antrtida porque contiene una cantidad catastrfica de agua en su capa de hielo Aunque es poco probable que la capa de hielo de la Antrtida se derrita por completo tiene suficiente agua para elevar el nivel global del mar en 230 pies 70 metros En el plazo inmediato los eventos de El Nio tienen impactos divergentes en la Antrtida dijo Cai con aumentos y disminuciones en diferentes reas Pero en conjunto indic la tendencia es clara una disminucin general del hielo marino,science,El fenmeno de El Nio en el ocano Pacfico tropical La Nia ha sido uno de los cambios de prediccin a largo plazo a CNN el profesor Adam Scaife.

Optimism,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored these questions and more at our BakeOffs and Show Floor Sh,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored 19772 chars,Extreme weather events and their devastating impacts are more frequent and severe but which populations are most affected Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored these questions and more at our BakeOffs and Show Floor Showdowns at our Data and Analytics Summit in Orlando with 4000 of our closest DA friends and family We did two BakeOffs this year The first featured analytics and BI platform Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders while the other showcased high interest data science and machine learning platforms The BakeOffs are fastpaced fun and informative sessions that let you see leading vendors sidebyside using scripted demos and a common data set in a controlled setting And this years BakeOffs did not disappoint To extend the BakeOff experience to a broader range of vendors including smaller innovators we also did a series of Show Floor Showdowns for analytics and BI data science and machine learning and for data management The Show Floor Showdowns were held on the Exhibit Hall show floor and were based on the same demo script and data set used in the BakeOffs Any vendor that Gartner has covered in any of its research and all vendors that had a booth in the Data and Analytics Summit Orlando Exhibition Hall could apply to participate in Show Floor Showdowns From there participants were randomly selected and invited to present live at the Show Floor Showdown sessions We also gave the demo script and data set to all vendors in the Exhibit Hall to create demos for their booths and to submit for this blog For the vendors that participate in the BakeOff and Show Floor Showdowns it is in equal measure fun and extremely stressful Its a high stakes session where they put everything on the line in front of their arch competitors revealing whats coming and coveted sales tactics all while being judged by attendees It takes a fair bit of preparation extreme commitment and an ability to shine under pressure What Data Did We Use We use the BakeOffs and the Show Floor Showdowns as a platform for data for good This years scenario was to understand the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and the resulting devastating human and economic impact because of unpredictable weather conditions Are there mitigation strategies that can be implemented successfully that could provide policy guidance and reasons for optimism in the face of ever increasing frequency of extreme weather events We gave the vendors data from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD data and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA from the National Centers for Environmental Information They could supplement this data with any other relevant data sets Last years topic was the UNs Sustainable Development Goals In 2021 we explored vaccine effectiveness and inequity using global vaccine data In 2020 we analyzed population health data In past BakeOffs we explored loneliness and happiness data opioid epidemic data traffic fatalities college costs and homelessness The results showing the impact of flooding predictions for the future and reasons for optimism were fascinating This blog highlights some notable findings and the videos from participating vendors BI BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Microsoft Here is the link to Microsofts BI BakeOff video Qlik Key Findings In the US alone theres 367 billion in agricultural commodities at risk to flooding in the US alone There have been 338 weather events that have created over a 1 billion dollars USD plus of damage totaling to 24 trillion in damages altogether and averaging 71 billion per event For most coastal countries climate change and flooding are critical topics of policy and development strategies A large part of underdeveloped Asian countries ranging from Bangladesh to Vietnam are at high risk of flooding events Here is the link to Qliks BI BakeOff video Salesforce Tableau Key Findings Unlike other European countries the Netherlands has the most square meters of land at risk of flooding as well as the greatest population at risk of flooding 70 While there are many factors that can contribute to flood risk such as changes in landuse from urbanization and deforestation there are also natural geographic features that can put certain populations at increased flood risk These factors include  of population at risk average elevation and  of inland waterways throughout a region A big factor as to why Netherlands faces extreme flooding risk is that 15 of the region is comprised of inland waterways As population density increases in major metropolitan areas predisposed to flooding risk to life and livelihood is expected to continue to increase In 2000 the Netherlands had 85 million people at risk of catastrophic flooding In 2040 that number is projected to grow to 102 million Here is the link to Tableaus BI BakeOff video Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Alteryx Key Findings The task was to analyze the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and provide mitigation strategies The objective was to identify highrisk areas the US Department of Interior should focus their resources for river flooding over the next 10 years Climate change may lead to more frequent and severe flooding Through the analysis we found regions with high risk of flooding including Big Horn County in Montana which has a high Native American population at higher risk of safety and economic impact Recommended mitigation strategies include improved infrastructure early warning systems landuse planning and community engagement focused on the middle Rockies surrounding areas Here is the link to Alteryxs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Dataiku Dataiku chose to focus on flood risk by geography and floodings economic impact on commercial insurance policies and claims With a business use case of defining a location and insurance strategy for a proposed warehouse in southeast Florida here are some of the key findings Extreme rainfall and rising sea levels are driving up both flood frequency and insurance costs especially in highrisk Florida areas Southern Floridas Atlantic coast has increased flood risk leading to more and costlier flood insurance claims in areas like Homestead and Miami compared to West Palm Beach and Port Saint Lucie Our analysis suggests prioritizing Hobe Sound or Stuart FL for real estate investment due to no past floods or claims within a 60minute driving radius reducing risks to warehouse contents and distribution routes Interpretation of our machine learning model suggests buying 50k in building coverage and 100k in warehouse content coverage as the latter significantly boosts predicted flood claim payouts Here is the link to Dataikus Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video SAS SAS took the view that mitigating and anticipating flooding events should be focused on the goal of helping people SAS created on top of the traditional statistical and machine learning models to predict events a set of four unique models specifically focused on helping people impacted by flooding An optimization network model cost network flow algorithm to optimally help displaced people reach public shelters and safer areas An optimization network model vehicle routing algorithm to optimize routes and the time it takes to transport displaced people to public shelters and safer areas An autocorrelation forecasting model to identify parameter estimators associated with relevant variables that impact the likelihood of flooding events Based on these estimators SAS created an easy to use whatif dashboard The user can change the variable values to understand how these changes would impact the likelihood of future flooding events A time series regression on referenced spatial data to estimate future flooding locations within hurricanescyclones paths The hope is governments could prepare for a flooding event and consider mitigating actions to help people in future danger Here is the link to SASs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Analytics and BI Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Course5 Intelligence Key insights from Course5 Intelligence include The US states with the highest susceptibility to coastal flooding for a 10year return period are Alaska Delaware Maryland and New Jersey Louisiana Arkansas Mississippi and West Virginia are the US states with the greatest vulnerability to river flooding for a 10year return period During river flooding Louisiana experiences more severe impacts on builtin lands and crops with exposure percentages of 5060 for builtin lands and 4045 for crops based on data from the OECD on river flooding Between the years 2000 and 2020 river flooding in Louisiana caused crop damages worth 270 million and property damages worth 91 billion Heavy rainfall along with storms is one of the primary causes of flooding in Louisiana as evidenced by the graph of flood frequencies vs annual precipitation  Some of the other general reasons for flooding in Louisiana are hurricanes poor drainage levee breaches and deforestation Also based on the historical data there is a very high chance of flooding in Louisiana in the year 2024 with a likelihood of 31 According to ChatGPTs suggestion some of the flood mitigation strategies that could be deployed by the government in Louisiana are improve the drainage system improve building standards improve land use practices and improve emergency response Here is the link to Course5s Show Floor Showdown video Datamatics Key Findings In China Impact of coastal flooding on built up area exposure has increased from 445 in year 2000 to 664 in year 2020 In Washington Impact of coastal flooding on built up area exposure has increased from 0  1 in year 2000 to 5  7  in year 2020 The key driver analysis for Coastal flooding in United States has shown significant differences between flooding at a state level and at a country level Further our analysis shows the significance of exposure to coastal flooding in terms of builtup area cropland and land exposure New York  Builtup Area Exposure is significant California  Land Exposure is significant Texas  Land Exposure is significant The Entire United States  Builtup Area Exposure is significant Here is the link to Datamatics Show Floor Showdown video Domo Key Findings YearoverYear YoY analysis has shown that based on data from the first quarter of 2023 the Northern Gulf Coast of Florida Leon County has a hotter average temperature than the previous 4 years Weather station analysis shows that Leon County Florida has received the most precipitation by 50 over other key flood zones in Florida although MiamiDade county has had the most flood events year to date Insights driven by regression analysis demonstrate that major storm events 100year 50year and 25year impact zones for built up areas and will continue to increase over the next 5 years as 10year impact zones stabilize thus identifying that major storm event activity will continue to grow in size and impact on the surrounding areas of typical flood events Although Leon and MiamiDade counties are seeing the largest impact respectively due to increased precipitation and flood events Lee County has the highest average damage in dollars per event due to hurricane activity Here is the link to Domos Show Floor Showdown video Incorta Here is the link to Incortas Show Floor Showdown video LTIMindtree Lumin picked up the South Asia Region for the river flooding analysis Some of their key insights include India has seen the highest population more than 40 million impacted by river flooding in the last five years This river flooding has been caused by severe land precipitation but has been exacerbated by growth in dry grassland cover and artificial surface cover at the cost of vegetative cover A quick simulation revealed that continued urbanization in India would lead to another 6500 square kilometers of land area being exposed to floods in a five year horizon A statewise deep dive uncovered the densely populated West Bengal and Bihar as the most affected regions with 17 million people exposed to floods in Bihar There is however a cause for optimism as the trend of flood mortality or the casualties from flooding events has decreased steadily Densely and moderately populated regions in India have seen a significant drop in flood mortality  This decrease in casualties is driven by drop in the number of flooding events and the number of days of flooding but the number of people displaced due to flooding in India continues to remain fairly high each year causing massive social and economic upheaval Here is the link to LTI Mindtrees Show Floor Showdown video SAP Analytics Cloud Key Findings River Flood has more impact on Population and Economics The only exception is in the Netherlands where Coastal Flood is a significant problem Population at Risk Cropland at Risk and Total Land at Risk all have a linear relationship with Population Cropland and Land in a country Due to this the largest and most populated countries suffer more typically found in Asia The most suffering countries are at the same time largest Agriculture producers with a high share of Agriculture in their GDS Therefore flooding is not only dangerous for people and infrastructure but also has a large economic effect especially affecting food supply through Agriculture Countries with a high GDP per capita are in the safest positions regarding flood while low GDP per capita countries are strongly affected by floods Here is the link to SAP Analytics Clouds Show Floor Showdown video Tellius  Was not selected for the Show Floor Showdown this year but provided a video by the deadline as per the participation rules Key Findings After analyzing global disasters across the past 30 years to understand the impact of floods vs other natural disasters we discovered that from 1990 to 1991 there were a lot of land and mud slides in eastern Asia that led to a 388 increase in total affected population due to floods caused by heavy rains Put simply indirect floodrelated disasters have proven devastating to human life loss When exploring river and coastal flooding for the USA on a city level river flooding area had a drastic increase starting from 2015 Finally by enriching the data with flood Insurance claims we found that the most recent dollar claim value impact occurring in Ida Oklahoma Here is the link to Telliuss Show Floor Showdown video Data Science and Machine Learning Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Aible Key Findings Predicting floods is not as actionable as focusing our resources on trying to address floods that affect at least 100 people Such a specific goal enabled a far more useful analysis We need to balance multiple KPI such as lives affected vs economic impact of the floods as well as stay within relevant budgets We need to consider fairness For example if we stayed within current budgets and only focused on the economic impact of floods we would underinvest in underdeveloped regions This would be contrary to the goals of a hypothetical UN agency By trying out different definitions of fairness we can balance our fairness goals against economic ones A manual process cannot possibly consider so many different constraints but an AIfirst businessoutcomedriven approach conducts such analysis in minutes Here is the link to Aibles Show Floor Showdown video eQ Technologic Key Findings Cropland exposure and Builtup area exposure related parameters play a major role is deciding the flood predictions As for USA maximum floods have occurred in Quarter2 The highest cause of floods remains heavy rains and torrential rains It is observed that Texas has maximum floods in the last 5 years and they have been successful in reducing the damage due to floods in last 3 years Arizona has also reduced the damage and fatalities caused due to floods in the last 3 years Across the world it is observed that cropland exposure to river floods have gone down over the years Similarly buildup area exposure to coastal floods has also gone down Here is the link to EQ Technologics Show Floor Showdown video Data Management Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos These vendors provided findings related to managing the data in their platforms Cloudera Hybrid analytics and transaction functions can coexist on the same data management platformbut require different storage processing memory and channels management from each other This reinforces the demand for workload management and separate optimization techniques Orchestration is the key to data management across intercloud multicloud and hybrid onpremises systems Pervasive and persistent monitoring of use cases can result in automation of patternbased or repetitive tasks Patternbasis can also consist of gradual drift and shift of workload patterns and this can be built into a predictive efficiency model Metadata management goes beyond technical metadata and even combining that with business metadata when it infers or anticipates new users of recently introduced data assets Effectively the pull analytics data search can be converted into a push and verify model in which new data is pushed to existing use cases Cloudera comes from being built for the cloud era Here

collaborative air combat The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now  The post Rafale F41 Standard ,A Rafale F41 during testing with the AASM 1000 guided bomb Photo DGA The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now  5309 chars,The new standard brings major capability upgrades which pave the way for collaborative air combat The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now ready for fielding While the announcement was released just few days ago the qualification arrived on March 13 2023 shortly after the first aircraft in the new configuration was delivered to the Base Arienne 118 at MontdeMarsan The first plane we received is one of the F3Rs that we sent to the Flight Test Center of the Directorate General of Armaments in Istres for their software transformation explains Lieutenant Colonel Guillaume second in command of the Fighter and Experimentation Squadron ECE Other brand new aircraft will come directly from the Dassault production lines and will complete the fleet of fighters sent gradually to Istres for their transition from the F3R standard to the F41 The first Rafale F41 has been assigned to the Centre dExpertise Arienne Militaire Military Air Expertise Center followed by a second aircraft a week later where it immediately started operational testing the day after the delivery As mentioned by Lt Col Guillaume the DGA confirmed all the Rafales of the Air and Space Force and the French Navy will be gradually retrofitted to this new standard Dassault also resumed the deliveries of new Rafales to French military after a fouryear interruption The development of the Rafale F4 standard started in early 2019 when the contract for the new upgrade was notified by the Ministry of Defense soon after the certification of the F3R standard This standard is based on four pillars connectivity engagement availability and the detection and fight against threats said the Minister of the Armed Forces in that occasion This F4 standard is a technological leap an industrial leap a strategic leap According to the DGA improving the connectivity of the Rafale and the associated networked employment methods both in a national and allied context is the primary goal of the F4 standard The new standard will be the first step towards the networked multiplatform capabilities of the future Systme de Combat Arien Futur SCAF The F4 standard will include upgrades of existing capabilities like the Thales RBE2 Active Electronically Scanned Array AESA radar the Spectra Systme de Protection et dvitement des Conduites de Tir du Rafale or in English SelfProtection Equipment Countering Threats to Rafale Aircraft electronic warfare system the OSF Optronique secteur frontal frontal sector optronics the InfraRed Search and Track IRST the Thales Talios targeting pod the Reco NG reconnaissance pod and the communications suite However there will also be important new capabilities like the Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display HMD the MICA NG NextGeneration airtoair missile and the new 1000 kg variant of the Safran AASM Armement AirSol Modulaire Hammer PrecisionGuided Munition PGM Many of the new capabilities have been extensively tested during a test campaign in 2021 where two Rafale 41 were included in largescale realistic scenarios where the crews also implemented unspecified collaborative combat functionalities to localize adversaries by passive means The HMD is a longwaited capability for the Rafale Initially the Sagem Gerfaut HMD was chosen in the early 2000s to equip the Rafale however the program was later dropped According to reports Qatar and India asked for an HMD on their aircraft so the Elbit Targo II was integrated on the Rafale France however chose to integrate the Scorpion with a first test campaign carried out in Cazaux during March 2021 preceded by parachute compatibility tests to verify that the new helmet is safe for the pilot in the event of an ejection As for the 1000 kg AASM the new variant sees the AASM kit applied on the BLU109 penetrator warhead or the standard Mk84 but also to new developments in progress from the French company ARESIA BA84 and P1000 bomb bodies according to the missions needs The first separation tests were performed in December 2020 at the DGA Flight test center in Cazaux The new AASM variant has have also a specific range increase kit to extend its standoff firing range and was certified at the end of 2022 The Rafale will be able to carry up to three of these bombs of which one under the fuselage and two under the wings similarly to the already certified GBU24 Paveway III The Talios targeting pod has also been upgraded as announced by the DGA in November 2022 with the delivery of the 31st pod which is the first of the upgraded variant Among the new capabilities the pod has a highdefinition mode which integrates a near infrared imager and a color widefield sensor expected to be fully exploited by the Rafale 42 standard and an integrated datalink Among the other modifications the DGA mentioned the evolution of passive threat detection algorithms increased data exchange capacities between Rafales greater protection against cyber threats and improvements in fire control for the use of the Meteor missile with the missile managed by an aircraft other than the firing aircraft The Meteor missile was introduced with the F3R standard and became operational in 2021 intended to be used in conjunction with the MICA EM for long range engagements,science,The French Air and Space Force has started fielding the new Rafale F41 standard.

siren for lifethreatening storms in Americas heartland a new computer model that combines artificial intelligence AI and NASA satellite data could sound the alarm for dangerous space weather The model uses AI to analyze spacecraft measurements of the solar wind an unrelenting stream of material from the Sun and predict where an impending solar storm will strike anywhere on Earth with 30 minutes of advance warning This could provide just enough time to prepare for these storms and prevent severe impacts on power grids and other critical infrastructure The Sun constantly sheds solar material into space  both in a steady flow known as the solar wind and in shorter more energetic bursts from solar eruptions When this solar material strikes Earths magnetic environment its magnetosphere it sometimes creates socalled geomagnetic storms The impacts of these magnetic storms can range from mild to extreme but in a world increasingly dependent on technology their effects are growing ever more disruptive For example a destructive solar storm in 1989 caused electrical blackouts across Quebec for 12 hours plunging millions of Canadians into the dark and closing schools and businesses The most intense solar storm on record the Carrington Event in 1859 sparked fires at telegraph stations and prevented messages from being sent If the Carrington Event happened today it would have even more severe impacts such as widespread electrical disruptions persistent blackouts and interruptions to global communications Such technological chaos could cripple economies and endanger the safety and livelihoods of people worldwide In addition the risk of geomagnetic storms and devastating effects on our society is presently increasing as we approach the next solar maximum  a peak in the Suns 11year activity cycle  which is expected to arrive sometime in 2025 To help prepare an international team of researchers at the Frontier Development Lab  a publicprivate partnership that includes NASA the US Geological Survey and the US Department of Energy  have been using artificial intelligence AI to look for connections between the solar wind and geomagnetic disruptions or perturbations that cause havoc on our technology The researchers applied an AI method called deep learning which trains computers to recognize patterns based on previous examples They used this type of AI to identify relationships between solar wind measurements from heliophysics missions including ACE Wind IMP8 and Geotail and geomagnetic perturbations observed at ground stations across the planet From this they developed a computer model called DAGGER formally Deep Learning Geomagnetic Perturbation that can quickly and accurately predict geomagnetic disturbances worldwide 30 minutes before they occur According to the team the model can produce predictions in less than a second and the predictions update every minute The DAGGER team tested the model against two geomagnetic storms that happened in August 2011 and March 2015 In each case DAGGER was able to quickly and accurately forecast the storms impacts around the world Previous prediction models have used AI to produce local geomagnetic forecasts for specific locations on Earth Other models that didnt use AI have provided global predictions that werent very timely DAGGER is the first one to combine the swift analysis of AI with real measurements from space and across Earth to generate frequently updated predictions that are both prompt and precise for sites worldwide With this AI it is now possible to make rapid and accurate global predictions and inform decisions in the event of a solar storm thereby minimizing  or even preventing  devastation to modern society said Vishal Upendran of the InterUniversity Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics in India who is the lead author of a paper about the DAGGER model published in the journal Space Weather The computer code in the DAGGER model is open source and according to Upendran it could be adopted with help by power grid operators satellite controllers telecommunications companies and others to apply the predictions for their specific needs Such warnings could give them time to take action to protect their assets and infrastructure from an impending solar storm such as temporarily taking sensitive systems offline or moving satellites to different orbits to minimize damage With models like DAGGER there could one day be solar storm sirens that sound an alarm in power stations and satellite control centers around the world just as tornado sirens wail in advance of threatening terrestrial weather in towns and cities across America Related Links Space Weather at NASA Solar Science News at SpaceDaily,science,Scientists have developed a computer model that can quickly and accurately predict where an impending solar storm will strike anywhere on Earth with 30 minutes of advance warning.
