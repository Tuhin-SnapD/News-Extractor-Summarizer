Journal reporter w 5243 chars,WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan the State Department said Sunday In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan whom the statement said was wrongfully detained US officials said they were considering a similar determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time Should that happen his case would be largely transferred to the office of the US Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Joe Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was Let him go The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editorinchief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation US consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Rep Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee noted that the government has advised US citizens to leave Russia This is not unexpected in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following Turner ROhio told CNNs State of the Union In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the chance of progress in US efforts to free its detained citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized On Saturday night Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram Interactions between the top US and Russian diplomats have been rare since Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 though they did have a brief conversation last month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference of foreign ministers in India It was the highestlevel inperson talks between the two countries since the war That interaction was their first contact since last summer when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a US proposal for Russia to release Whelan and Griner Though Whelan was not included in the oneforone swap that resulted in the release of Griner US officials said they remain committed to bringing him home Contact us at letterstimecom,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian

credibility For generations Swahilis have maintained matrilineal family burial gardens such as this one in Faza town Lamu County Credit Chapurukha Kusimba 2012 CC BYND The legacy of the medieval Swahili civilization is a source of extraordinary pride in East Africa as reflected in its language being the official tongue of Kenya Tanzania and even inland countries like Uganda and Rwanda far from the Indian Ocean shore where the culture developed nearly two millennia ago Its ornate stone and coral towns hugged 2000 miles 3200 kilometers of the coast and its merchants played a linchpin role in the lucrative trade between Africa and lands across the ocean Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China By the turn of the second millennium Swahili people embraced Islam and some of their grand mosques still stand at the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Lamu in Kenya and Kilwa in Tanzania Selfgovernance ended following Portuguese colonization in the 1500s with control later shifting to the Omanis 17301964 Germans in Tanganyika 18841918 and British in Kenya and Uganda 18841963 Following independence coastal peoples were absorbed into the modern nationstates of Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar So who were the Swahili people and where did their ancestors originally come from Ironically the story of Swahili origins has been molded almost entirely by nonSwahili people a challenge shared with many other marginalized and colonized peoples who are the modern descendants of cultures of the past with extraordinary achievements Working with a team of 42 colleagues including 17 African scholars and multiple members of the Swahili community weve now published the first ancient DNA sequences from peoples of the Swahili civilization Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them Colonization affected how the story was told Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Postcolonial scholars including one of us Kusimba pushed back against that view Earlier researchers had inflated the importance of nonAfrican influences by focusing on imported objects at Swahili sites They minimized the vast majority of locally made materials and what they revealed about African industry and innovation But viewing Swahili heritage as primarily African or nonAfrican is too simplistic In fact both perspectives are byproducts of colonialist biases The truth is that colonization of the East African coast did not end with the departure of the British in the middle of the 20th century Many colonial institutions were inherited and perpetuated by Africans As modern nationstates formed with governments controlled by inland peoples Swahili people continued to be undermined politically and economically in some cases as much as they had been under foreign rule Decades of archaeological research in consultation with local people aimed to address the marginalization of communities of Swahili descent Our team consulted oral traditions and used ethnoarchaeology and systematic surveys along with targeted excavations of residential industrial and cemetery locations Working with local scholars and elders we unearthed materials such as pottery metal and beads food house and industrial remains and imported objects such as porcelain glass glass beads and more Together they revealed the complexity of Swahili everyday life and the peoples cosmopolitan Indian Ocean heritage Ancient DNA analysis was always one of the most exciting prospects It offered the hope of using scientific methods to obtain answers to the question of how medieval people are related to earlier groups and to people today providing a counterweight to narratives imposed from outside Until a few years ago this kind of analysis was a dream But because of a technological revolution in 2010 the number of ancient humans with published genomescale data has risen from nothing to more than 10000 today Surprises in the ancient DNA We worked with local communities to determine the best practices for treating human remains in line with traditional Muslim religious sensitivities Cemetery excavations sampling and reburial of human remains were carried out in one season rather than dragging on indefinitely A detailed line drawing captures the way one persons remains were discovered during cemetery excavation at Mtwapa in 1996 Credit Eric Wert 2001 CC BYND Our team generated data from more than 80 people mostly elite individuals buried in the rich centers of the stone towns We will need to wait for future work to understand whether their genetic inheritance differed from people without their high status Contradicting what we had expected the ancestry of the people we analyzed was not largely African or Asian Instead these backgrounds were intertwined each contributing about half of the DNA of the people we analyzed We found that Asian ancestry in the medieval individuals came largely from Persia modernday Iran and that Asians and African ancestors began mixing at least 1000 years ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale Another surprise was that mixed in with the Persians Indians were a significant proportion of the earliest migrants Patterns in the DNA also suggest that after the transition to Omani control in the 18th century Asian immigrants became increasingly Arabian Later there was intermarriage with people whose DNA was similar to others in Africa As a result some modern people who identify as Swahili have inherited relatively little DNA from medieval peoples like those we analyzed while others have more One of the most revealing patterns our genetic analysis identified was that the overwhelming majority of maleline ancestors came from Asia while femaleline ancestors came from Africa This finding must reflect a history of Persian males traveling to the coast and having children with local women One of us Reich initially hypothesized that these patterns might reflect Asian men forcibly marrying African women because similar genetic signatures in other populations are known to reflect such violent histories But this theory does not account for what is known about the culture and there is a more likely explanation Traditional Swahili society is similar to many other East African Bantu cultures in being substantially matriarchalit places much economic and social power in the hands of women In traditional Swahili societies even today ownership of stone houses often passes down the female line And there is a long recorded history of female rulers beginning with Mwana Mkisi ruler of Mombasa as recorded by the Portuguese as early as the 1500s down to Sabani binti Ngumi ruler of Mikindani in Tanzania as late as 1886 Our best guess is that Persian men allied with and married into elite families and adopted local customs to enable them to be more successful traders The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coasts African matriarchal traditions confirms that this was not a simple history of African women being exploited African women retained critical aspects of their culture and passed it down for many generations How do these results gleaned from ancient DNA restore heritage for the Swahili Objective knowledge about the past has great potential to help marginalized peoples By making it possible to challenge and overturn narratives imposed from the outside for political or economic ends scientific research provides a meaningful and underappreciated tool for righting colonial wrongs This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license Read

leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament f 6314 chars,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament following his conviction by a Surat court in a defamation case Congress leaders have taken to the streets in large numbers instead of going to the higher court to seek relief against the order of the CJM court Talking of the legal aspect many Congress leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself The alleged undue haste in sending the notice of disqualification to Rahul Gandhi has also come under severe criticism by the Congress leaders Their legal experts have argued that since the sole basis of disqualification is the sentencing for two years jail term hence suspension of the sentence has to be construed to mean an automatic suspension of the disqualification Even before the Surat court pronounced its verdict on March 23 several legal experts had expressed similar opinions and held that there were indeed very dim chances of Rahul losing his parliamentary seat in the likely event of his conviction and sentencing However in truth such experts need to read the relevant legal provisions afresh It is expressly stated in the sub section 3 of section 8 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two yearsshall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release From a bare reading of the relevant provision it is obvious that disqualification results directly from the conviction Actual imprisonment is not a necessary condition for disqualification Further the intent of the lawmakers who enacted the RP Act undoubtedly was to effect disqualification immediately upon conviction on a criminal charge involving sentence of imprisonment or fine as specified in the section 8 of the Act Their intent is evident from the heading of this section which readsDisqualification on conviction for certain offences Also Read  Here is the election speech Rahul Gandhi was convicted and has lost his MP seat for It is interesting to recall the manner in which Rahul Gandhi publicly tore down in September 2013 a copy of the ordinance brought out by the then government headed by Dr Manmohan Singh to circumvent the SC judgment for the purpose of saving subsection 84 of the RP Act At that time Rahul Gandhi was an idealist young leader eager to project himself as the cleanest politician much like his late father Rajiv Gandhi and committed to the cause of purging politics of criminal elements in India Terming the ordinance as an attempt to block the way to decriminalization of politics which had been cleared by the Supreme Court by their judgment in the Lily Thomas case Rahul had expressed his anger and disgust in no uncertain terms and blasted the impugned ordinance That the ordinance had been brought out by the government of his own party made no dent on his resolve to ensure the withdrawal of the ordinance It is indeed an irony that the very same Rahul Gandhi should fall prey to the absence of the very same instrument of law he had opposed so vehemently about a decade back He could not have imagined this development in his wildest dreams while tearing down the impugned ordinance in a press conference held in 2013 This is not the first time that a legislator has lost his seat upon conviction on a criminal charge Rasheed Masood was the first such lawmaker to lose his seat in the Parliament in October 2013 Since then more than 20 other legislators have been disqualified including Vikram Saini Ashok Chandel Kuldeep Senger all of the BJP and Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party To be fair to Rahul Gandhi it must be conceded that while all these legislators were disqualified on conviction of such heinous crimes as rape of minor and murder he had been held guilty of mere criminal defamation that too for certain words uttered by him during an election speech However as pointed out by eminent lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani the prevailing law so long as the conditions of conviction and sentencing specified in section 8 of the RP Act are fulfilled makes no distinction on the basis of the nature of crime Therefore from a legal point of view there is no merit in the protests of Congressmen on this count However it is high time to make suitable amendments in the law relating to disqualification of members of the parliament and the state legislative assemblies so as to provide for different treatment to the law makers on the basis of the nature of crime they are convicted of It is highly unreasonable to treat someone guilty of defamation by making loose talks at par with those found guilty of rape and murder However talking of the political side of the matter it is obvious that the high moral ground being claimed by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress does not rightfully belong to them in the present political context prevailing in the country His claim of fighting for the democracy in India does not convince anyone in the country in view of the past record of the Congress governments under the leadership of his grandmother who suspended even the fundamental rights of Indian citizens including the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution Indira Gandhi holds a record in dismissing state governments at the drop of a hat including that in the most sensitive state of Jammu and Kashmir The murder of democracy charge was more aptly applicable when the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister NT Rama Rao was dismissed in 1984and was replaced by his finance minister N Bhaskar Rao even when Rama Rao was undergoing treatment in the US Advertisement Similarly the allegation of arrogance Rahul Gandhi is so fond of levelling against the PM does not hold much water given the way Gandhi stubbornly turned down all suggestions to apologise in the courtroom in the case for his defamatory words His claims to be walking in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi is ridiculous It is expected of the leaders of men to be humble enough to apologise when they are obviously in the wrong not to try to turn their follies into virtue with a view to derive political mileage Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh  Kailash Gupta is former director

aziende pi ricche del mondo hanno pessime abitudini nella scelta e gestione delle proprie password A rivelarlo una ricerca di NordPass  da anni che gli esperti di cybersecurity ripetono limportanza di scegliere password solide in particolar modo allinterno di contesti aziendali Ma i dipendenti delle societ pi importanti del mondo continuano a ritenere sufficienti credenziali banali come 123456 e password Da un certo punto di vista sembra paradossale che le societ pi ricche del pianeta con tutte le risorse necessarie per investire in cybersecurity si rivelino cos superficiali nella scelta e nella gestione delle password Da unaltra prospettiva per questo fenomeno dimostra ancora una volta che le cattive abitudini sono profondamente radicate in un numero sorprendente di utenti Questa ricerca ribadisce quanto sia importante velocizzare la transizione verso sistemi di autenticazione online alternativi ha dichiarato Jonas Karklys amministratore delegato di NordPass Anche se lanalisi di NordPass sulluso delle password da parte degli utenti di internet non si interrompe mai questanno lazienda ha deciso di concentrarsi nel dettaglio sulle password utilizzate dai dipendenti delle societ pi grandi del mondo da 31 Paesi diversi per proteggere gli account aziendali I ricercatori hanno quindi compilato una lista contenente le 20 password pi utilizzate per ogni settore industriale qui i dettagli Dummies sexy4sho e altre password particolari Secondo lo studio password e 123456 rispettivamente al primo e secondo posto nella classifica delle password pi usate al mondo dellanno scorso vanno per la maggiore anche nelle aziende pi importanti Nei 20 settori analizzati entrambe le password sono rientrate nella classifica delle 7 scelte pi utilizzate In alcuni settori si nota anche una creativit maggiore rispetto ad altri La password dummies  al sesto posto fra i dipendenti del settore dei beni di consumo sexy4sho traducibile in sicuramentesexy  al 16 posto fra quelli del settore immobiliare mentre snowman pupazzo di neve  all11 nel settore energetico E a quanto pare chi lavora nel settore finanziario sembra avere un bisogno urgente di staccare la spina perch le password pi utilizzate sono ready2go pronto a partire vacation vacanza e summer estate La musa ispiratrice delle password Cos come succede fra gli utenti standard le parole del dizionario nomi di persone e Paesi o semplici combinazioni di numeri lettere e simboli sono fra le chiavi pi comuni rilevate da questa ricerca Detto questo il rimanente 32 indica unaltra tendenza interessante I dipendenti delle compagnie pi ricche del mondo adorano le password che fanno riferimento diretto o indiretto al nome di unazienda La ragione sociale il nome di dominio usato dalle password aziendali parte del nome della ditta una sua abbreviazione il nome di un prodotto o di una societ controllata sono fra le fonti di ispirazione pi comuni Password di questo tipo sono al tempo stesso fragili e pericolose Questo perch gli hacker provano spesso password contenenti il nome aziendale per accedere in maniera illecita a sistemi di societ specifiche Non  un caso lesperienza suggerisce che password di questo tipo sono fra le pi comuni I dipendenti spesso evitano di usare credenziali complesse in particolar modo negli account condivisi Per questo motivo si trovano spesso a optare per scelte troppo semplici magari influenzate dal nome dellazienda ha continuato Karklys Numeri e ampiezza dello studio Lanalisi delle password delle aziende pi ricche al mondo  stata condotta in partnership con ricercatori indipendenti specializzati in incidenti di cybersecurity Sono state prese in considerazione le 500 societ pi importanti per capitalizzazione a rappresentare 31 Paesi e 20 settori industriali Stati Uniti 462 Cina 96 Giappone 58 India 42 Regno Unito 4 Francia 38 e Canada 36 sono stati i Paesi pi rappresentati in questa ricerca Per quanto riguarda invece i settori pi coinvolti si possono citare finanziario tecnologico e sanitario Le password sono destinate a morire Lo studio  lultimo di una serie di progetti legati alle password condotti da NordPass negli anni Nel 2021 sono state analizzate le password usate nelle aziende Fortune 500 mentre nel 2022 loggetto dellinvestigazione erano state le password dei manager aziendali pi importanti Ogni anno Nord Pass presenta anche la ricerca delle 200 password pi usate che offre uno sguardo dinsieme sulle tendenze principali in questo ambito Se i trend variano ogni anno a seconda del tipo di pubblico considerato in generale si pu notare come le persone continuino a gestire male le proprie password Sembra chiara la necessit di nuove soluzioni per lautenticazione online come le passkey ha sottolineato Karklys Aziende note per limpegno verso linnovazione come Google Microsoft Apple PayPal KAYAK ed eBay hanno gi adottato questa tecnologia offrendo soluzioni di accesso senza password ai propri utenti Secondo Karklys a breve saranno molte altre le aziende online che seguiranno questo percorso NordPass ha sviluppato una sua soluzione per conservare e gestire le passkey dei propri clienti e riferisce di stare sviluppando un nuovo strumento per le aziende che permetta di integrare in modo facile e intuitivo le passkey allinterno dei propri siti Secondo un report di IBM nel 2022 il furto delle credenziali ha continuato a

Streets empty as normal activity becomes imposs 10147 chars,I n the opening scenes of The Ministry for the Future the novelist Kim Stanley Robinson imagines what happens to a small Indian town hit by a heatwave Streets empty as normal activity becomes impossible Airconditioned rooms fill with silent fugitives from the heat Rooftops are littered with the corpses of people sleeping outside in search of a nonexistent breath of wind The electricity grid then law and order break down Like a medieval vision of hell the local lake fills with halfpoached bodies Across north India 20m die in a week Mr Robinson said he wrote his bestseller published in 2020 as a warning The IndoGangetic Plain which extends from the spine of Pakistan through northern India to the deltas of Bangladesh is home to 700m people and exceptionally vulnerable to the heat pulses that climate change is making more frequent It is one of the hottest poorest and most populous places on earth see map Its electricity grids are unreliable Between 2000 and 2019 South Asia saw over 110000 excess deaths a year due to rising temperatures according to a study in Lancet Planetary Health a journal Last years hot season which runs from March until the arrival of the monsoon in late May or early June was one of the most extreme and economically disruptive on record This years could rival it India has just experienced its hottest December and February since 1901 In March the India Meteorological Department  IMD  and its counterpart in Pakistan  PMD  warned of aboveaverage temperatures and heatwaves until the end of May On March 6th Narendra Modi Indias prime minister chaired a review on hot season preparedness Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority has kicked off a countrywide simulation to test emergency responses to the flooding that can follow extreme heat Despite a relatively cool March the coming weeks could be perilously hot On April 1st Mrutyunjay Mohapatra IMD s chief sounded the alarm again Scientists record heat stress as a combination of temperature and humidity known as a wetbulb measurement As this combined level approaches body temperature 37C it becomes increasing hard for mammals to shed heat through perspiration At a wetbulb temperature of around 31C dangerously little sweat can evaporate into the souplike air Brain damage and heart and kidney failure become increasingly likely Sustained exposure to a temperature of 35C the level Mr Robinson imagines in his book is considered fatal The IndoGangetic Plain is one of the few places where wetbulb temperatures of 35C have been recorded including on several occasions in the scorched Pakistani town of Jacobabad A report by the World Bank in November warned that India could become one of the first places where wetbulb temperatures routinely exceed the 35C survivability threshold The regular temperature last year peaked in Jacobabad which sits at the border of Pakistans provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at 51C Half the towns population of 200000 had by then fled in search of more bearable temperatures Even after the temperature began to ease in early June it was hard to resume regular activity Ali Bahar a dailywage labourer in Jacobabad recalls trying and failing to work in its surrounding fields in June While driving a tractor in 42C heat he felt feverish and dizzy then tumbled from the machine injuring his head Coworkers carried him to a local clinic which dished out the standard treatment of a packet of orangeflavoured rehydration salts Though he was discharged six hours later he was unable to work for a week The temperature record provides a horrifying account of the changes afoot According to the definition of a heatwave used by Indias weather agency which takes into account average annual local temperatures and the duration of the anomaly India saw on average 235 heatwaves every year in the two decades to 2019 more than double the annual average of 99 it saw between 1980 and 1999 Between 2010 and 2019 the incidence of heatwaves in India grew by a quarter compared to the previous decade with a corresponding increase in heatrelated mortality of 27 During last years hot season India experienced twice as many heatwave days as in the same period in 2012 the previous record year Climate change made last years heat pulse 30 times likelier than it would otherwise have been according to World Weather Attribution a global research collaboration That is both because it has raised Indias average annual temperatureby around 07C between 1900 and 2018and because it has made anomalous heat surges bigger and more frequent The magnifying effect of the built urban environment which can be 2C hotter than nearby rural areas is often especially pronounced in Indias concrete jungles Those living in slum housing which offer little air circulation and often use heatsucking materials such as tin suffer the worst of it If the climate warms by 2C compared with preindustrial levels as appears unavoidable such events would be more likely by an additional factor of 220 Even if the world makes more headway on curbing greenhousegas emissions than looks likely vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience wetbulb temperature episodes exceeding 31C which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans according to a paper by Elfatih Eltahir of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and colleagues The costs of crippling heat are already vast Even working in the shade on an average summer day in Delhi results in labour losses of 1520 minutes per hour at the hottest times reckons Luke Parsons of Duke University in North Carolina Mr Parsons and colleagues have estimated that India loses 101bn man hours per year to extreme heat and Pakistan 13bn During last years withering hot season the wheat harvest was down by around 15 in both countriesand in some regions by as much as 30 Livestock perished The normal agricultural day became impossible Electricity outages in part caused by increased demand for cooling shut down industry and worse airconditioning India saw blackouts even in pampered cities such as Delhi the capital Schooldays were cancelled or curtailed A study in 2020 by McKinsey Global Institute  MGI  a corporate thinktank estimates that the loss of workinghours to extreme heat in India has risen from 10 of the maximum total before 1980 to 15 today Models suggest that proportion will double by 2030 The effect is hugely exacerbated by how labourintensive India and other hot and poor places are see chart In 2017 heatexposed work accounted for 50 of Indias GDP and employed 75 of the labour force or some 380m By 2030 reckons MGI such work will still make up 40 of GDP and the rising number of lost work hours could put at risk 2545 of GDP or 150250bn Pakistan could lose 659 of GDP due to climate change the World Bank warned last year as increased floods and heatwaves reduce agriculture and livestock yields destroy infrastructure sap labour productivity and undermine health What short of reversing global warming can be done Administrators in Ahmedabad a city in Indias western state of Gujarat offer a guide In 2010 it suffered a heatwave that killed 800 people in a week This was a shocking figure says Dileep Mavalankar As director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar Gujarats capital he helped Ahmedabad design Indias first heat action plan  hap  It recommended several simple but effective measures for example warn people of extreme temperatures advise them to stay indoors and drink lots of water and put emergency services on high alert Today there are estimated to be more than 100 such plans in Indias cities districts and states Karachi Pakistans commercial capital developed a similar plan after a heatwave in the city in 2015 killed 1300 people These steps probably contributed to a surprisingly low death toll during last years extended heatwave Early estimates identified only 90 deaths in India attributable to it The true number was probably much greater but may well have been lower than the 4000 who died on the IndoGangetic Plain from a heatwave in 2015 The fact that last years heatwave was exceptional places such as Jacobabad aside not particularly humid was probably the main reason for this It is also the case that poor places used to intense heat are better at adapting to it than illaccustomed rich ones Some hap s are better than others A new study by the Centre for Policy Research a thinktank in Delhi found that many oversimplified heat hazards by ignoring the role of humidity failed to target vulnerable groups and lacked adequate financing Provisions for forecasting heatwaves are also variable Indias IMD issues a daily heat bulletin with fiveday colourcoded forecasts Pakistan is much further behind The PMD is creaky in technology says Sherry Rehman the countrys minister for climate change To be better prepared we will need better forecasting abilities The two countries would do better by cooperating says the UN They will both increasingly be called on to take much costlier measures such as designing cold shelters rethinking urban planning and building materials and bailing out those unable to work in the heat We are going to have to learn to live in a warmer world says Gabriel Vecchi a scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey The question is how orderly costly or calamitous that learning process will be It is hard to find much comfort in the underlying facts Year by year parts of the poor and crowded IndoGangetic Plain will become increasingly unlivable for days or weeks on end Even the most capable government would struggle to prevent that leading to catastrophe And Indias much less Pakistans is not the most capable This is in fact where Mr Robinsons dystopian novel goes off the rails He imagines the heatwave he describes spurring transformative climate action around the world That was ludicrously unrealistic concluded Francis Fukuyama a political scientist Yet without such action it is hard to see what will stop one of the most dire promises of global warming becoming a horrifying reality ,"In the opening scenes of The Ministry for the Future, the novelist Kim Stanley Robinson imagines what happens to a small Indian town hit by a heatwave",science

temperaturas rcord durante los ltimos cuatro aos informaron cientficos en enero Luego a mediados de marzo los climatlogos notaron que la temperatura global de la superficie del mar subi a un nuevo mximo La increble tendencia preocupa a los expertos sobre lo que podra ocurrir en el futuro especialmente porque los pronsticos indican que El Nio est en camino y junto con l impactos como calor extremo ciclones tropicales peligrosos y una amenaza significativa para los frgiles arrecifes de coral La Nia y El Nio son fenmenos naturales en el ocano Pacfico tropical La Nia se caracteriza por temperaturas ocenicas ms fras que el promedio mientras que El Nio trae temperaturas ms clidas que el promedio Ambos tienen una gran influencia climtica en todo el mundo Y es casi seguro que un cambio

en cuenta El mundo podra superar los 15 grados de calentamiento por primera vez El Nio podra por primera vez hacer que el mundo supere los 15 grados centgrados de calentamiento por encima de los niveles preindustriales de mediados a finales del siglo XIX Los pases se comprometieron en el Acuerdo Climtico de Pars a limitar el calentamiento global a menos de 2 grados y preferiblemente a 15 grados en comparacin con las temperaturas preindustriales Los cientficos consideran que 15 grados de calentamiento es un punto de inflexin clave ms all del cual las posibilidades de inundaciones extremas sequas incendios forestales y escasez de alimentos podran aumentar drsticamente Un fenmeno de El Nio fuerte podra empujar al planeta a ese punto dijo Scaife aunque solo sea temporalmente

registrado actualmente es 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte El mundo ya ha visto aproximadamente 12 grados de calentamiento ya que los humanos continan quemando combustibles fsiles y produciendo contaminacin que calienta el planeta Y a pesar de los tres aos de enfriamiento de La Nia las temperaturas se han disparado a niveles peligrosos Europa sufri su verano ms caluroso en 2022 con temperaturas superiores a los 40 grados Celsius 104 Fahrenheit y Pakistn e India experimentaron una ola de calor abrasador donde partes del pas alcanzaron ms de 49 grados Celsius 120 Fahrenheit En ltima instancia si se alcanza el umbral de 15 grados o se pasa por alto por poco realmente no importa dijo Scaife Es la primera vez en la historia de la humanidad que ese valor est al alcance y ese es el punto realmente significativo Cualquiera que sea el nivel exacto de calentamiento que trae El Nio es muy probable que algunos de sus impactos incluidas las temperaturas extremas no tengan precedentes dijo Scaife Cada vez que tenemos un El Nio se suma a una cantidad cada vez mayor de calentamiento global que hemos acumulado Podra haber ms lluvia que rompa la sequa en el oeste California

Estados Unidos continentales El Nio es un rompedor de sequa dijo Rippey a CNN Aunque la ubicacin exacta de la sequa o la falta de ella vara considerablemente de un evento a otro La situacin en el ro Colorado que proporciona agua para beber riego y electricidad a aproximadamente 40 millones de personas en todo el suroeste se ha visto afectada por el uso excesivo y una sequa provocada por el cambio climtico La crisis del agua se ha vuelto tan grave que el gobierno federal anunci cortes de agua obligatorios nunca antes vistos en los ltimos dos aos Jon Gottschalck pronosticador jefe del Centro de Prediccin Climtica de la NOAA ampli la idea de Rippey y seal que una corriente en chorro ms fuerte y extendida del Pacfico corrientes de aire de flujo rpido en la atmsfera superior que influyen en el tiempo del da a da podra elevar las probabilidades de ros atmosfricos para la costa oeste al mismo tiempo que causa precipitaciones ms intensas en el sur Sequa calor y fuego en otros lugares En otras partes del mundo El Nio podra amplificar las sequas las feroces olas de calor y los peligrosos incendios forestales Sudfrica e India corren el riesgo de sequa y calor extremo al igual que las naciones cercanas al Pacfico occidental incluidas Indonesia Australia y las naciones insulares del Pacfico como Vanuatu y Fiji Para Australia que an se recupera de las extensas inundaciones es probable que El Nio traiga un clima mucho ms seco y clido especialmente en las reas orientales del pas Desde 1900 18 de los 27 aos de El Nio han significado una sequa generalizada de invierno y primavera dijo a CNN un portavoz de la Oficina de Meteorologa de Australia Sus recientes inundaciones tambin han aumentado los temores de una temporada de incendios forestales particularmente destructiva ya que el incremento del crecimiento de la vegetacin podra proporcionar combustible para los incendios a medida que el clima se vuelve ms seco y clido India tambin se prepara para los impactos de El Nio que puede debilitar el monzn que trae las lluvias de las que depende para llenar los acuferos y los cultivos El monzn tiende a verse ms afectado cuando hay un cambio de un invierno de La Nia que acabamos de ver a un verano de El Nio que es probable que sea el verano de 2023 dijo Raghu Murtugudde cientfico de sistemas de la Tierra en la Universidad de Maryland El dficit general de lluvias monznicas puede llegar al 15 dijo a CNN El Nio tambin podra hacer subir las temperaturas en India que ya experimenta olas de calor inusualmente tempranas Es un peligro compuesto porque las olas de calor y El Nio tienden a retrasar el inicio del monzn dijo Kieren Hunt cientfica investigadora de la Universidad de Reading en Inglaterra Meses de perodos secos supondran una enorme presin sobre la seguridad del agua afirm Un ocano Pacfico ms clido equivale a ciclones ms fuertes Una de las primeras huellas dactilares de El Nio segn Gottschalck ser evidente en los cambios en la actividad de los ciclones tropicales A diferencia de La Nia El Nio tiende a reducir la actividad de los huracanes en el Atlntico pero crea el efecto contrario en el Pacfico donde las aguas clidas pueden generar tifones ms intensos Los ciclones tropicales a menudo pueden formarse ms al oeste en la cuenca y permanecer ms fuertes por ms tiempo por lo que aumentan los impactos potenciales en Hawai dijo Gottschalck Esto significa ms posibilidades de tocar tierra e impactos impulsados de forma remota como mares ms fuertes y de mayor duracin fuertes lluvias y ms En otras partes del Pacfico Swain dijo que los modelos muestran aguas muy clidas frente a la costa de Per que ya generan precipitaciones inusualmente fuertes e inundaciones en los desiertos Ese es un precursor clsico de un evento significativo de El Nio A medida que El Nio se forme y se fortalezca a finales de este ao Per podra correr un riesgo an mayor de sufrir ms inundaciones El gobierno ya est listo para invertir ms de US 1000 millones en medidas climticas y meteorolgicas para prevenir lo peor Los arrecifes de coral podran sufrir un blanqueamiento catastrfico El Nio es un calentador de ocanos y el agua ms clida es una mala noticia para los arrecifes de coral Cuando se calientan demasiado los corales escupen las algas que viven dentro de su tejido lo que les proporciona tanto su color como la mayor parte de su energa Esto hace que los corales se vuelvan blancos en un fenmeno llamado blanqueamiento Si bien pueden recuperarse si las temperaturas eventualmente bajan el blanqueamiento los pone en mayor riesgo de inanicin y muerte Un perodo particularmente catastrfico de blanqueamiento de corales ocurri entre 2014 y 2017 afectando a todos los arrecifes importantes de la Tierra La Gran Barrera de Coral de Australia registr la muerte de casi el 30 de sus corales en una ola de calor marina rcord en 2016 que sigui a un El Nio muy fuerte que comenz en 2015 Ms eventos de blanqueamiento masivo continuaron y con El Nio en el horizonte los cientficos estn cada vez ms preocupados por los impactos en el coral que simplemente no ha tenido tiempo suficiente para recuperarse Lo que se predice aqu da mucho miedo dijo Peter Houk profesor del Laboratorio Marino de la Universidad de Guam que estudia el coral en Micronesia Cada vez que viene uno crece un poco ms en intensidad El Nio no significa necesariamente que todo el coral se ver afectado dijo Houk Cada El Nio es diferente y siempre hay otros patrones climticos naturales en juego Pero cuando sucede es brutal asegur Cuando llegue El Nio ser una oportunidad para aprender ms sobre cmo reacciona el coral y dnde pueden aparecer focos de resiliencia dijo Houk Solo quiere que aguante un poco ms Esperamos que las predicciones sean incorrectas y luego podamos comprar algunos aos ms para que los corales se recuperen Ms hielo derretido en la Antrtida El hielo antrtico ya est en problemas y El Nio podra empeorarlo A principios de este ao los niveles de hielo en el continente descendieron a mnimos histricos por segunda vez en dos aos lo que provoc el temor de que despus de aos de altibajos ahora podra estar en una fuerte tendencia a la baja El Nio podra ayudar a acelerar este proceso segn una investigacin reciente que encontr un vnculo entre la fuerza y la frecuencia de los eventos de El Nio y la velocidad del derretimiento del hielo antrtico Los modelos que proyectan un mayor aumento de El Nio producen sistemticamente un derretimiento de la capa de hielo ms rpido que los modelos que proyectan un cambio menor en El Nio dijo a CNN Wenju Cai cientfico investigador jefe de CSIRO la agencia cientfica nacional de Australia Los cientficos vigilan de cerca a la Antrtida porque contiene una cantidad catastrfica de agua en su capa de hielo Aunque es poco probable que la capa de hielo de la Antrtida se derrita por completo tiene suficiente agua para elevar el nivel global del mar en 230 pies 70 metros En el plazo inmediato los eventos de El Nio tienen impactos divergentes en la Antrtida dijo Cai con aumentos y disminuciones en diferentes reas Pero en conjunto indic la tendencia es clara una disminucin general del hielo marino,"El presidente de la Comisin Nacional, Luis Inacio Caldern, y el presidente de la Comisin de Derechos Humanos, Luis Inacio Caldern, han sido informado ayer durante el sbado",science

urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Wh,WASHINGTON Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who 5158 chars,Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan whom the statement said was wrongfully detained US officials said they were considering a similar determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time Should that happen his case would be largely transferred to the office of the US Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan  the State Department said Sunday Advertisement Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was let him go Advertisement The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editor in chief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation US consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Representative Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee noted that the government has advised US citizens to leave Russia This is not unexpected in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following Turner an Ohio Republican told CNNs State of the Union Advertisement In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the chance of progress in US efforts to free its detained citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized On Saturday night Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram Interactions between the top US and Russian diplomats have been rare since Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 though they did have a brief conversation last month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference of foreign ministers in India It was the highestlevel inperson talks between the two countries since the war Advertisement That interaction was their first contact since last summer when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a US proposal for Russia to release Whelan and Griner Though Whelan was not included in the oneforone swap that resulted in the release of Griner US officials said they remain committed to bringing him home,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to immediately release journalist Anna Politkovskaya.,science
