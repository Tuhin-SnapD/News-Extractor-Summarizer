analyses concerning the position of the Cayman Islands in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 Twenty years later t 62883 chars,The Cayman Islands is a key node in contemporary global finance yet it is severely underresearched This paper compiles the first anatomy of the Cayman offshore financial center OFC utilizing all sources of publicly available data about the three main segments banking direct investment and portfolio investment The analysis is performed both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different segments This dissection of the Cayman OFC shows that the United States is the largest counterparty in all segments with Japan playing an important role too In fact when excluding longterm Treasuries Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world Hedge funds are the main factor for this strong CaymanUS link About 60 of global hedge fund assets are legally domiciled in Cayman  an extraordinary spatial concentration in such a tiny jurisdiction A novel contribution to the analysis of the Cayman OFC is the introduction of the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach This approach provides one plausible explanation for the unparalleled rise of the Cayman OFC by seeing this jurisdiction as one node in an AngloAmerican triangle together with the USA and the UK Caymans sovereign power INTRODUCTION Small place big money was the apt title of one of the first analyses concerning the position of the Cayman Islands in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 Twenty years later the archipelago south of Cuba is of course still small in geographic terms The amount of foreign capital booked in the Cayman offshore financial center OFC however has become bigger in this period of time  much bigger Significantly improved availability of data concerning OFCs and their counterpart countries during the last two decades allows for a better understanding of the role that the Cayman Islands plays in international finance This tiny group of islands in the Caribbean with roughly 58000 inhabitants and a domestic economy of less than US3 billion has attracted foreign capital of over US4100 billion if we take into account banking assets direct investment and portfolio investment note that the total stock of external assets is likely much higher because there are no data available for trusts see Harrington Citation2016 Setting the amount of foreign assets in relation to the GDP of a particular jurisdiction results in a specific offshoreintensity ratio Fichtner Citation2015 According to this ratio the Cayman Islands is by far the most intensive OFC in the world with foreign assets amounting to over 1500 times Caymans domestic economy Moreover the Cayman Islands is not only large in relative terms but also in absolute ones the small Caribbean archipelago has attracted more external assets than advanced industrial countries such as Japan Canada or Italy despite them having economies several hundred times Caymans GDP Consequently Cayman is not just any random small island OFC it is one of the largest financial centers in the world and a central node in contemporary global finance However this unique OFC is severely underresearched As the legal domicile of choice for the global hedge fund industry Clarkson et al Citation2014 and as the second largest jurisdiction in the world regarding the issuance of assetbacked securities ABS from 1983 to 2008 Cetorelli and Peristani Citation2012 the Cayman Islands has played a key role for financial innovation in recent decades From 2004 to 2007 Cayman had even been the largest jurisdiction concerning the issuance of collateralized debt obligations CDOs according to Culp and Forrester Citation2010 Hedge funds as well as opaque CDOs have contributed to the development of the global financial crisis and thus such financial innovation has serious consequences for international financial stability Lysandrou Citation2012 Lysandrou and Nesvetailova Citation2015 Wjcik Citation2013a Citation2013b Utilizing all sources of publicly available data this paper compiles the first anatomy of the pivotal Cayman OFC The aim is to perform a finegrained analysis of the three main segments of crossborder finance 1 banking 2 direct investment and 3 portfolio investment This indepth case study of the Cayman Islands OFC is highly complementary to recent studies in Economic Geography eg on the role of advanced business services for offshore finance Wjcik Citation2013a on offshore jurisdictions and foreign direct investment FDI Haberly and Wjcik Citation2015a Citation2015b and finally on the political geography of offshore banking Haberly and Wjcik Citation2014 In order to further our understanding of the extremely successful development of the Cayman OFC this paper introduces the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach from international relations IRs and International Political Economy IPE to the analysis of the Cayman OFC Furthermore I analyze the important role of Japan which has escaped virtually all existing studies about the Cayman Islands The remainder of this paper is organized in six sections In the first section I briefly discuss the existing research about the Cayman Islands The second section analyzes the development of the oldest segment of the Cayman OFC  banking The following two sections are dedicated to the large domain of investment Specifically in the third section I scrutinize the comparatively small but growing segment of direct investment before analyzing the major segment of portfolio investment including the crucial hedge fund sector in the fourth section The fifth section introduces the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach to the research on the Cayman OFC Finally the sixth section concludes by discussing avenues of future research as well as some policy implications RESEARCH ABOUT THE CAYMAN OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTER Despite the importance of the Cayman Islands OFC the literature is still surprisingly scant Scholars from Economic Geography have arguably contributed the most to advancing our understanding of the Cayman Islands and its role in the international financial system Roberts Citation1995 237 conclusion that the Caymans have created the image of a respectable upmarket OFC and strategically positioned themselves at the nexus of the circuits of fast and fungible financial capital is still valid today Furthermore Roberts Citation1995 argues that the status as a dependent territory of the UK is of central importance for the success of the Cayman Islands as an OFC because this status guarantees political stability She identifies a series of 1960s laws designed to attract foreign capital as a cornerstone for the development of the Cayman OFC Rapid growth began in the 1970s after the end of the Bretton Woods system and the concomitant transition to free exchange rates which included the abolition of capital controls by most Western countries According to Roberts Citation1995 the number of foreign banks active in the Cayman Islands grew at an annual average rate of 23 between 1972 and 1982 This is primarily due to the rapid development of the Euromarkets in the City of London Palan Citation1998 Burn Citation1999 which subsequently included OFCs such as the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands Ridley Citation2007 Hudson Citation1998a has compared the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas and concludes that the specific development of these OFCs can only be explained by analyzing the behavior of transnational actors eg American and Canadian banks and lawyers and important counterpart countries primarily the USA Moreover he emphasizes the key role of trust by foreign financial actors in the particular OFC which takes time to develop and in practice limits the mobility of capital Hudson Citation1998b Hudson Citation2000 confirms the view by Roberts Citation1995 that the status as a British dependency has been beneficial to the Cayman Islands because the independence of the Bahamas in 1973 led to a flight of capital from there to Cayman Besides Economic Geography IR and IPE have contributed significantly to the research about offshore finance in general and the Cayman OFC in particular Palan Citation1998 635 coined one of the most cogent definitions of offshore finance Offshore is legal enclaves distinguished from their onshore brethren not necessarily because of their location but because they define a territory or a realm of activities in which states choose to withhold some or all of their regulations and taxation In that sense offshore signals a profound fissure in the life of the state system it denotes nothing less than the bifurcation of the juridical space of sovereignty into mutually dependent relative spaces Palan et al Citation2010 too stress the importance that the Cayman Islands is a British dependency in fact it is still legally correct to refer to the British Overseas Territories as colonies of the UK Hendry and Dickinson Citation2011 4 Moreover Palan et al Citation2010 report that in 2008 Cayman was the fourth largest international banking center in the world however concentrating only on shortterm financing An important point that Palan et al Citation2010 highlight is that most OFCs and Cayman in particular act as secrecy jurisdictions Secrecy through opaque financial structures played a key role in the corporate scandals of Enron Olympus and Parmalat as well as in the nearcollapse of the large hedge fund LTCM which all had significant subsidiaries in Cayman According to the Tax Justice Network the Cayman Islands is number five in the 2015 Financial Secrecy Index which combines a secrecy score with a global scale weight in financial services exports TJN Citation2015a Cobham et al Citation2015 Caymans relatively high secrecy score of 65 however is lower than those of other major OFCs such as Switzerland 73 or Singapore 69 reflecting regulatory improvements in recent years TJN Citation2015b The analysis of the Cayman Islands OFC by Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 focuses primarily on legal aspects but nonetheless represents one of the most comprehensive endeavors to trace the development of this jurisdiction since the 1960s Their core argument is that the success of the Cayman OFC stems primarily from what they call the collaborative policymaking process that includes local politicians and regulators foreign experts mainly lawyers from Canada and the USA as well as British officials Moreover Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 argue that the high reliability of the Cayman legal system based on English common law and  even more important  its ability to innovate have been crucial for the rise of the Cayman Islands to one of the largest financial centers in the world A central example that Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 discuss is the creation of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority CIMA in the mid1990s the legislation for CIMA was developed together with the leading Cayman law firm Maples  Calder founded by two British lawyers in the 1960s and the Bank of England Finally Harrington Citation2016 24 has argued that the creation of the Cayman Special Trust Alternative Regime STAR law in 1997 represented a crucial innovation as it eliminated the need for a trust to have beneficiaries  another step in the cooptation of characteristics of the corporate structure making trusts more convenient for use in commercial investment Besides the academic literature on the Cayman OFC there are analyses from governmental and international organizations The United States Government Accountability Office GAO has conducted a study about the factors that cause US citizens and corporations to shift financial activities to the Cayman Islands In addition to the obvious motivation to save taxes another reason was to simplify transactions with third countries the good reputation of the Cayman Islands for stability legal certainty and compliance with international standards also seems to play an important role for the success of this jurisdiction GAO Citation2008 In 2009 the IMF has assessed the regulation of the Cayman Islands financial center The locally available expertise in matters of financial law and accounting  mainly provided by large international advanced business services firms  is identified as an important competitive advantage of this jurisdiction The greatest danger to the success of the Cayman Islands OFC according to the IMF Citation2009 11 is reputational risk  the potential loss of confidence by foreign investors Finally the OECD found Cayman to be largely compliant with international standards of tax information exchange OECD Citation2013 The various studies presented here have analyzed a range of important aspects concerning the development of the Cayman Islands OFC However the most obvious research gap is that there is no publication that has systematically compiled all available data about this OFC  both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different financial segments Such an anatomy of all relevant financial data is a fundamental prerequisite for a profound and comprehensive analysis of this pivotal OFC The Cayman OFC can be analytically separated in three distinct yet interrelated segments banking direct investment and portfolio investment OFFSHORE BANKING Banking represents the historical foundation upon which Cayman has built its OFC During the 1960s the Cayman Islands enacted a series of laws tailored to attract financial business from abroad especially banks TJN Citation2015b The crucial decision that enabled the later development of the Cayman Islands OFC was to remain under British sovereignty when in 1962 Jamaica which had governed Cayman became independent Expatriate lawyers from Britain and Canada drafted many Cayman laws either copying them from the Bahamas or adapting British laws Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 Through its history as a British colony the Cayman Islands inherited English common law This is of central importance to the success of the Cayman OFC because financial actors from Anglophone countries USA UK Canada etc are familiar with it and because in the English legal tradition law evolves in a bottomup fashion from individual case decisions thus significantly facilitating transnational finance The key difference between common law and civil law is that in general Anglophone common law only stipulates what is prohibited whereas civil law France Germany Japan etc identifies what is permitted Vlcek Citation2008 The consequence is that new financial innovations such as ABS CDOs or hedge funds can be set up easily because strict regulation is only put in place in case of conspicuous misconduct or strong pressure from powerful foreign actors The Bahamas was one of the biggest offshore banking centers in the 1960s When however Nassau experienced political instability in the late 1960s leading to the independence of the Bahamas from the UK in 1973 Cayman was ready and took over much of the fleeing business Hudson Citation1998a Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 Ridley Citation2007 During the 1970s and 1980s Cayman experienced rapid growth in offshore banking due to the liberalization and deregulation of finance pursued primarily by the USA and the UK as well as the development of the Euromarkets  themselves a kind of offshore market because Britain decided to withhold regulations on the trading of foreign currencies in the City of London Burn Citation1999 Data on crossborder banking in the Cayman Islands began in 1983 and come from the Bank for International Settlements BIS The BIS collects two kinds of statistics the Locational Banking Statistics LBS and the Consolidated Banking Statistics CBS each using a different methodology The LBS capture the positions of all banking offices resident in the reporting countries 44 in 2015 including Cayman visvis counterparties located in over 200 countries Thus the LBS are based on the principle of residence Note that in the LBS banks record their positions on an unconsolidated basis including intragroup claims and liabilities between subsidiaries of the same bank The CBS on the other hand are based on the nationality of banks These statistics capture the consolidated positions of internationally active banking groups headquartered in the reporting countries 31 in 2015 Data include the claims of foreign subsidiaries of reporting banks but exclude intragroup positions The CBS can thus be used to analyze the exposure of internationally active banks of different nationalities to individual jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands In other words LBS measure all international positions of banks resident in Cayman insideout perspective whereas CBS measure the consolidated international banking claims visvis banks and nonbanks located in the Cayman Islands outsidein perspective Figure 1 shows LBS claims and CBS data for Cayman from end1983 to end2014 The

Offshore Banking Sector 19832014 billion US Display full size Figure 1 Development of the Cayman Offshore Banking Sector 19832014 billion US From 1983 to 1991 the international claims of bank subsidiaries resident in the Cayman Islands LBS grew much faster than the consolidated claims of internationally active banking groups from the countries participating in the CBS on counterparties resident in Cayman From the early 1990s until the mid2000s both measures grew with approximately the same pace LBS increased from about US415 billion to roughly US1125 billion while CBS increased from around US90 billion to over US600 billion Then however LBS grew by 50 in just two years to a peak of over US1800 billion in 20072008 when the global financial crisis began before stabilizing at around US1400 billion from 2012 until today The financial crisis did not stop the upward trend of the Cayman Islands in CBS Consolidated foreign claims briefly declined from over US900 billion in 2007 to US735 billion in late 2008 However since then claims have increased steadily to a new alltime peak of US1060 billion in 2014 or roughly 350 times Caymans GDP These are astonishing dimensions for such a tiny jurisdiction with only about 58000 inhabitants In most segments of crossborder banking Cayman is in the global top five In one specific measure the Cayman Islands is even the third largest jurisdiction This is external loans and deposits of reporting banks visvis individual countries unconsolidated outsidein perspective part of LBS Table 1 shows the 15 largest jurisdictions in this segment of crossborder banking in March 2015 The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 1 External loans and deposits of reporting banks visvis individual countries March 2015 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table The banking statistics by the BIS provide other useful information about the Cayman offshore banking sector as well For example 68 of the claims reported by banking offices located in the Cayman Islands are intragroup 26 are to nonbanks and only 6 are to other banks  and over 91 of all claims are in US dollar BIS Citation2015a These numbers seem to confirm the findings by the IMF Citation2009 that the largest factor for the Cayman banking sector is US banks that transfer clients funds to overnight sweep accounts in the Cayman Islands over 57 of all assets in 2008 Such sweep accounts are profitable for banks and their clients mostly large corporations because they reduce reserve requirements and because excess funds in checking accounts can automatically be swept overnight in instruments such as Eurodollar deposits repurchase agreements or money market funds FDIC Citation2009 Cayman acts as a pure conduit for foreign banks in this segment or in the words of Gonzalo Jalles the CEO of Cayman Finance a significant part of the banking assets registered in Cayman are US banks placing overnight deposits in their own Cayman registered branch The money is effectively being transferred between accounts in NY and not being exposed to how a local banker in Cayman decides to invest it Klein Citation2013 Historically overnight sweep accounts in OFCs such as the Caymans developed because Regulation Q prohibited US banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts Regulation Q was repealed in 2011 and this may partly explain the drop in Cayman LBS from US1800 billion in 2011 to about US1400 billion since then see Figure 1 Existing Regulation D however still limits the number of domestic sweeps to six per month FED Citation2012 Sweep accounts in the Cayman Islands allow US banks to evade Regulation D When the Federal Reserve discontinued the reporting of data on domestic sweeps in March 2012 they measured just over US800 billion The IMF report suggests that sweeps of US banks to their Cayman branches are about the same magnitude According to US Treasury International Capital TIC data in June 2015 total US banking and shortterm securities claims on the Cayman Islands amounted to almost US720 billion or nearly 20 of total US international claims  the second highest value of all countries behind the UK with US860 billion Treasury Citation2016 On balance overnight sweep accounts of US banks in the Cayman Islands increase the complexity of the US financial system reduce reserve requirements of US banks and potentially increase clients risk because Cayman accounts are not insured by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation LBS data can also be used in another way to analyze unconsolidated crossborder positions reported by banking offices located in the BIS reporting countries visvis counterparties resident in the Cayman Islands According to these data the unconsolidated claims by BIS reporting banks to the Cayman Islands measured US1840 billion in March 2015 Interestingly over 56 of these claims are on nonbanks and only 44 on banks BIS Citation2015a In addition a surprisingly high share of 17 is denominated in Japanese yen 70 in US dollar and 7 in euro This is a strong indication that Japan plays a significant yet hitherto not analyzed role in the Cayman OFC Then there are also the CBS which are reported by nationality of banks The consolidated positions on counterparties resident in Cayman allow for a precise geographical analysis of the Cayman offshore banking center Specifically I use consolidated claims on an ultimate risk basis including other potential exposures In March 2015 these consolidated claims on counterparties resident in the Cayman Islands amounted to US1074 billion BIS Citation2015b Before we turn to a granular geographical analysis it is important to note that the vast majority of the claims are on nonbank financial over 73 which in all likelihood is mainly hedge funds and other investment vehicles Table 2 shows the claims of the ten largest countries The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 2 Consolidated claims on the Cayman Islands by nationality of reporting banks March 2015 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table Table 2 clearly shows that banks from the USA and Japan play the dominant role regarding consolidated claims on the Cayman Islands together they account for 63 Switzerland also plays a significant role but mainly due to US72 billion in guarantees extended to counterparties resident in Cayman included in other potential exposures German banks have the largest exposure to Cayman through derivatives contracts US18 billion and American banks have the highest credit commitments with almost US25 billion A detailed analysis of the CBS data reveals several other interesting facts The three categories bundled in other potential exposures derivatives contracts guarantees extended and credit commitments all show a strong peak in 200809 reflecting the prominent role of derivatives and special purpose vehicles legally domiciled in Cayman in the financial crisis Furthermore there are a number of abrupt jumps in the data of some countries for example total claims by US banks excluding other potential exposure leaped from US40 billion in December 2008 to US163 billion in March 2009 Since then US claims have increased steadily to over US283 billion in March 2015 Japanese claims jumped from US226 billion in December 2012 to US284 billion in March 2013 It is unclear whether these leaps only reflect better reporting by banks or genuine increased claims What is striking in Table 2 is that claims visvis banks are negligible compared to claims on nonbank financial This shows that the Cayman Islands do not function as an international banking center in the sense that banks from different nationalities lend to each other but rather that foreign banks mainly American and Japanese ones lend money to hedge funds and other investment funds Foreign banks resident in Cayman mostly conduct intragroup transactions in US dollar During the last thirty years the Cayman Islands has become one of the largest international banking centers  the global financial crisis notwithstanding However this section has shown that we need to dissect the anatomy of the Cayman offshore banking sector in order to understand its role in the international financial system which lies mainly in being the offshore jurisdiction of choice for US and Japanese banks The next section turns towards the dissection of Cayman direct investment DIRECT INVESTMENT Before we analyze the geography of Cayman inward and outward direct investment it is necessary to briefly discuss what direct investment means The huge domain of investment is separated into direct investment and portfolio investment Portfolio investment is defined as equity or debt instruments that are held passively to make financial gains the characteristic feature of FDI by contrast is the aim of the investor to exert control over a foreign company UNCTAD Citation2015a Globally the segment of portfolio investment is much larger than direct investment The former amounts to US48 trillion and the latter measures US28 trillion IMF Citation2015 Citation2016 This discrepancy is even more distinct for the Cayman Islands because a significant part of global FDI is greenfield projects ie the building of new facilities The tiny size of the domestic Cayman economy precludes significant inflows of greenfield FDI Hence foreign portfolio investment is much larger than FDI and the vast majority of Cayman direct investment has to be related to finance Table 3 shows the ten largest counterpart countries of the Cayman Islands for both inward direct investment IDI and outward direct investment ODI The data are from the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey CDIS by the IMF The Cayman Islands does not participate in the CDIS However IDI and ODI counterpart values allow the IMF to derive data for Cayman The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Table 3 Inward and outward direct investment stocks of the Cayman Islands 2014 billion US Download CSVDisplay Table CDIS data are available only since 2009 Cayman direct investment has more than doubled in just five years IMF Citation2015 However comparable to banking we do not know if these numbers reflect genuine growth or just better reporting In 2014 total Cayman IDI amounted to about US550 or over 180 times the GDP of the Cayman Islands  a very high value Note that Cayman direct investment is likely even higher than these numbers suggest because we do not have the corresponding direct investment data from other large OFCs such as Bermuda the British Virgin Islands BVI or Jersey Cayman ODI US540 billion is lower than IDI the difference of US17 billion is either Cayman direct investment into nonreporting OFCs or outward portfolio investment We can assume this because given the tiny size of the domestic Cayman economy virtually all inward investment portfolio and direct investment has to leave the jurisdiction again possibly changing its form while passing through Thus the Cayman Islands and other OFCs with minuscule GDPs are pure entrept jurisdictions concerning investment The United States is by far the largest source of direct investment with 52 of total IDI into Cayman see Table 3  Data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA allow us to dissect US ODI to the Cayman Islands more precisely The BEA only publishes US ODI data for United Kingdom Islands Caribbean which includes BVI Cayman Islands Montserrat and Turks and Caicos Islands this amounted to US288 billion in 2014 BEA Citation2015 However we can infer from the CDIS data on US ODI that Cayman accounts for almost 100 of this stock Hence it is reasonable to transfer the details of BEA data on United Kingdom Islands Caribbean to the Cayman Islands Thus in 2014 just two categories accounted for 80 of Cayman IDI from the US 1 holding companies nonbank and 2 finance including depository institutions with over 40 each  all categories pertaining to manufacturing are negligible US185 million The USA is also the largest destination for Cayman ODI US100 billion The Netherlands is the second largest source of Cayman IDI and the third largest destination for Cayman ODI US54 billion respectively US76 billion The Netherlands is the dominant global direct investment conduit specializing in Special Purpose Entities SPEs Weyzig Citation2013 has conducted an indepth case study about the Netherlands and found that Dutch SPEs allow multinational enterprises MNEs to avoid paying withholding taxes in many developing and EU countries and enable profit shifting through royalty payments Table 3 shows that the Cayman Islands is involved in this process via direct investment tofrom the Netherlands Luxembourg another large global direct investment conduit plays a similar role as the second largest destination for Cayman ODI US88 billion UNCTAD Citation2015b estimates that developing countries face tax revenue losses of US100 billion per year due to the role of OFCs and SPEs in international direct investment Brazil and China also use the Cayman Islands as a direct investment conduit in fact Cayman is the largest destination of Brazilian FDI IMF Citation2015 A combined ChinaHong Kong would be the second largest destination for Cayman ODI Cayman ODI to ChinaHong Kong has more than doubled from 2009 to 2014 US41 billion to US94 billion IMF Citation2015 Chinese MNEs have been found to channel direct investment through OFCs directly and also indirectly via Hong Kong not only to minimize taxes roundtripping but also to conceal the ownership of assets and to gain access to foreign capital markets Vlcek Citation2013 Buckley et al Citation2015 The BVI also under UK sovereignty is by far the largest offshore jurisdiction concerning Chinese direct investment in 2013 an astonishing US780 billion had flown from there to ChinaHong Kong IMF Citation2015 The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has revealed that  with the help of advanced business services firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers  many relatives of Chinas political and economic elite have set up shell companies in the BVI highlighting the role of OFCs as secrecy jurisdictions Walker Guevara et al Citation2014 The role of the Cayman Islands for Chinese investment seems to be more focused on MNEs from China that seek access to US capital markets The advanced business services firm PriceWaterhouse has devised a legal innovation in 2000 that allowed many Chinese corporations to circumvent Chinas restrictions on foreign investment in industries such as IT ecommerce and education Gillis Citation2012 This legal device is called the variable interest entity VIE VIEs allow Chinese corporations to publicly list abroad usually in the USA and thus to gain access to foreign capital The legal structure works as follows The Chinese corporation is separated into two parts  the businesses that are open to foreign ownership are transferred to a socalled wholly foreign owned enterprise WFOE the restricted businesses are put in the VIE which is owned and controlled by Chinese individuals Then an offshore holding company is created that owns the WFOE typically in the Cayman Islands because until 2014 it had been the only OFC allowed to publicly list corporations in both the USA and Hong Kong Sutherland and Anderson Citation2015 Subsequently the Cayman holding lists its shares in the USA However the problematic aspect had been how to consolidate the restricted businesses that are part of the VIE without violating Chinese rules on foreign investment The solution devised by accounting firms was to mimic ownership through a series of legal contracts between the Cayman company and the VIE These contracts give the Cayman holding enough de facto control over the Chinese VIE that it is able to consolidate it under current accounting rules even though Chinese law actually prohibits foreign investment in this sector Thus this legal structure constitutes a grey zone with considerable hidden risk for investors in the Cayman company because the whole structure rests on the willingness of Chinese authorities to tolerate it In 2014 the Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba the Cayman holding that is raised a record US25 billion with its initial public offering IPO in the USA thus probably perpetuating the VIE structure given the sheer size of the IPO However investors in Alibaba have no de jure control over the Chinese corporation as they only own shares in the Cayman holding Alibaba describes the situation to investors in a registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as follows You may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the US federal courts may be limited because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and most of our directors and all of our executive officers reside outside the United States SEC Citation2014 Chinas government seems to tolerate the use of VIEs in restricted sectors but only if the offshore holding is controlled by Chinese individuals through dual class shares or other arrangements Gillis Citation2015 This episode shows that Cayman is at the forefront of new developments in finance that often involve enormous risk for some parties shareholders in this case while benefiting others Chinese founders Cayman itself Furthermore the rise of VIEs supports the argument that there is an advanced business servicesoffshore nexus Wjcik Citation2013a that drives the development of OFCs Haberly and Wjcik Citation2015b have found that Cayman is part of the Anglo Alliance direct investment network acting as a strong link between the Pax Americana and the Greater China subnetworks This section has shed new light on the specific characteristics of Cayman direct investment However even though it already measures about half a trillion US dollar it represents the smallest of the three financial segments The largest segment by far is portfolio investment PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT Equity and debt instruments eg shares and bonds that are held for financial gain ie are below 10 of voting rights represent the bulk of global crossborder portfolio investment The most comprehensive data source for this segment is the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey CPIS by the IMF In mid2015 70 jurisdictions have participated in the CPIS including Cayman However the Cayman Islands reports only portfolio investment held by banks thus excluding the vast hedge fund sector Lane and MilesiFerretti Citation2010 Zucman Citation2013 This renders the official Cayman CPIS data virtually useless In addition to the reported assets the IMF also publishes derived portfolio investment liabilities These data are derived from the 70 reporting countries and cover 234 jurisdictions Especially for nonreporting OFCs or underreporting jurisdictions derived portfolio investment liabilities are extremely useful For mid2015 the Cayman Islands reported outward portfolio investment assets of US61 billion IMF Citation2016 The derived portfolio investment liabilities however reveal that Cayman inward portfolio investment is over US2574 billion  42 times more than the official Cayman data suggest Thus at mid2015 the Cayman Islands have been the sixth largest financial center in the world concerning crossborder portfolio investment The USA has been the largest jurisdiction with US9790 billion followed by the UK US3728 billion France US3049 billion Luxembourg US2926 billion and Germany with US2835 billion IMF Citation2016 The huge discrepancy between reported assets that exclude hedge funds and derived liabilities which include them shows that the hedge fund industry plays a central role for Cayman portfolio investment Zucman Citation2013 The financial geography of the Cayman hedge fund sector is analyzed in detail further below First I disaggregate Cayman portfolio investment in order to identify the largest counterpart countries As Coates and Rafferty Citation2007 have noted however the true nationality ie the ultimate ownership of portfolio investment is hard to verify because investment instruments may crossmultiple jurisdictions The countries participating in CPIS have reported US2574 billion of portfolio investment into the Cayman Islands in mid2015 The largest counterparty by far has been the USA with US1206 billion or 47 followed by Japan US558 billion Hong Kong US343 billion the UK US91 billion and Luxembourg with US83 billion IMF Citation2016 These five countries are responsible for almost 90 of total portfolio investment into Cayman Due to the severe underreporting of the Cayman Islands CPIS data are not useful for determining the destinations of Cayman portfolio investment Japan is the only major counterparty of Cayman that reports portfolio investment liabilities an encouraged item of CPIS in mid2015 Japan measured US51 billion of inward portfolio investment from the Cayman Islands Thus less than one tenth of the Japanese portfolio investment of over half a trillion US dollar to Cayman has flown back A substantial share has probably ended up in the USA According to US Treasury data the value of US securities held in Cayman amounted to a staggering US1506 billion in mid2015 making the Cayman Islands the third largest counterpart jurisdiction behind Japan and China Treasury Citation2016 In fact when excluding longterm US Treasuries of which the central banks or other public institutions from both Japan and China hold more than US1000 billion Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world US portfolio investment into Cayman amounted to US1206 billion Hence Cayman portfolio investment into the USA is US300 billion larger than vice versa It is reasonable to assume that a substantial share of this difference can be ascribed to investors from Japan and Hong Kong that use Cayman as a conduit for portfolio investment into the large American equity markets In 2003 the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority CIMA has created the Retail Mutual Funds Japan Regulations in order to enable Japanese financial institutions to launch hedge and mutual funds domiciled in Cayman eligible for Japanese investors The process included several visits by CIMA personnel to Japan and substantial research to align these specific Cayman regulations to Japanese laws Solomon Harris Citation2006 Thus Cayman acts as a fund conduit for Japanese investors providing them with a degree of secrecy when they invest in the USA in emerging markets and possibly in politically sensitive China Japan Times Citation2012 The combination of US Treasury data for US securities held in Cayman and CPIS data for all other holdings enables us to visualize Caymans position in international portfolio investment Figure 2 shows fourteen large countries in this segment that have significant investment ties with Cayman the size of the jurisdictions is equivalent to their value of inward portfolio investment from the other thirteen economies The Cayman Islands and all portfolio investment into this jurisdiction is shown in red The USA as the dominant country in crossborder investment is put at the center of the graph and colored dark grey as well as the portfolio investment into the USA all other jurisdictions are shown in light grey Jurisdictions have been arranged for maximum visual clarity The figure makes clear that the USA is still the undisputed center for international portfolio investment followed by the UK France Germany and Japan play a much smaller role as destinations of portfolio investment China for which CPIS data became available for the first time in mid2015 is still small in portfolio investment due to strong restrictions for foreign investors see Fichtner Citation2016 for four novel visualizations of global finance Figure 2 shows that Cayman is one of the largest global nodes for portfolio investment but primarily acts as a conduit for investment into the USA either via American roundtripping or from Japan and Hong Kong Luxembourg Switzerland and the UK also report notable portfolio investment into Cayman but on a much smaller scale than compared to the USA Japan and Hong Kong In mid2015 portfolio investment from Cayman to the United States US1506 billion has actually been the largest individual crossborder stock of portfolio investment in the world ahead of US portfolio investment into the UK with US1336 billion note that reserve holdings such as the large amount of US Treasuries held by Japan and China are excluded in CPIS This massive holding of portfolio investment by Cayman residents can only be understood by analyzing the financial geography of the Cayman hedge fund industry The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Figure 2 The Cayman Islands position in international portfolio investment mid2015 Display full size Figure 2 The Cayman Islands position in international portfolio investment mid2015 Until recently data on the global hedge fund industry had been exclusively collected by private companies such as Hedge Fund Research HFR In 2011 the International Organization of Securities Commissions IOSCO began publishing biannual hedge fund surveys These surveys however only cover large hedge funds with assets of more than US500 million In 2014 over 50 of the 1486 large hedge funds surveyed have been domiciled in Cayman IOSCO 2015  for large UK hedge funds the value is even 69 FCA Citation2015 According to the consulting firm OliverWyman in 2013 about 60 of total hedge fund assets have been legally domiciled in the Cayman Islands  14 in BVI 12 in Delaware Clarkson et al Citation2014 Hence both sources indicate that Cayman is the domicile of choice for the global hedge fund industry The fact that the majority of the entire hedge fund industry is legally concentrated in Cayman is remarkable for such a tiny jurisdiction Figure 3 plots the development of total hedge fund assets and Cayman portfolio investment Data for hedge funds are from HFR which maintains a database of over 7500 funds data for derived portfolio liabilities are from the IMF and data for estimated portfolio assets are from Zucman Citation2015 The anatomy of the Cayman Islands offshore financial center AngloAmerica Japan and the role of hedge funds All authors Jan Fichtner httpsdoiorg1010800969229020161243143 Figure 3 Development of Hedge Fund Assets and Cayman Portfolio Investment 20012014 billion US Display full size Figure 3 Development of Hedge Fund Assets and Cayman Portfolio Investment 20012014 billion US The result is astonishing all lines have moved extremely close together from 2001 to 2014 This suggests that 1 Cayman has been able to maintain its role as the leading domicile for hedge funds throughout this period and 2 that the hedge fund industry is significantly larger than the data from HFR indicate Calculations by the author based on CIMAs Investments Statistical Digest suggest that the Cayman hedge fund industry had approximately US2030 billion in assets under management in 2013 net asset value of master funds and standalone funds divided by 082 in order to adjust for the 18 of nonreporting funds see CIMA Citation2014 Thus if Cayman accounted for 60 of total hedge fund assets in 2013 the global hedge fund industry should have amounted to nearly US3400 billion instead of US2630 billion  this is consistent with estimates from eVestment for mid2013 which put global assets under management by hedge funds at US3411 billion Baert Citation2013 The remaining difference between Cayman hedge funds assets of US2030 billion and Cayman portfolio investment of US2200 billion is probably attributable to the estimated 15 of global private equity assets that are domiciled in Cayman Clarkson et al Citation2014 Hedge funds domicile in Cayman because there are no direct taxes because regulation is at once both lax and sophisticated based on English common law and finally because the jurisdiction enables a certain degree of secrecy The Financial Times revealed in 2011 that a small group of jumbo directors sat on the boards of hundreds of hedge funds making it virtually impossible for them to effectively fulfill their fiduciary duties to investors in the words of a quoted expert We have specialist directorship firms building obscenely large portfolios of directorships without even earning a rebuke from the Caymans regulator Jones Citation2011 A case that illustrates how hedge funds use Cayman secrecy is Tiger Global This fund created shell companies in Cayman with firm names including the legal suffices of European countries such as the Dutch NV or the German GmbH Then Blau GmbH Fest NV and other shells build up short positions in several listed corporations whose shares fell significantly after negative research reports emerged which could have been ordered by Tiger Global netting the fund substantial profits Johnson Citation2014 Paradoxically Cayman regulations have to be loose to a certain extent to give hedge funds enough flexibility but at the same time the regulatory infrastructure has to be sophisticated to maintain the image of a trustworthy upmarket OFC to investors and to avoid pressure by foreign countries Probably due to foreign pressure the Cayman regulator began publishing yearly investment statistics in 2008 These data allow for a granular analysis of the financial geography of Caymans giant hedge fund sector which comprised over 11300 funds at end2013 CIMA Citation2014 I do not use data on all registered funds but only on master funds to avoid doublecounting through funds of hedge funds detailed data on standalone funds are not available Master funds had net assets of US1230 billion in 2013 which represents about 60 of total Cayman hedge fund assets About 75 of master fund assets have been invested in North America Canada and the USA and only 19 in Europe probably mainly in the UK Thus there is a strong concentration of hedge fund investment in the USA investment in Canada is likely minor Hedge funds require a range of services to function such as net asset calculation as well as registrar and transfer agency services CIMA data show that the vast majority of these services is being provided in just three jurisdictions all of which are Englishspeaking the Cayman Islands 34 Ireland 28 and the USA 22 Finally there is detailed information about the location of hedge fund managers these data are crucial because they show where the investment decisions are actually being made Again we find a significant geographic concentration in Englishspeaking or Anglophone countries The United States is clearly dominant an extraordinary 70 of all master fund assets have been managed in the USA The UK ie London accounted for 16 This means that approximately 86 of master hedge fund assets have been managed in just these two countries For the USA CIMA statistics provide granular data about hedge fund manager locations New York is the predominant management location with over 40 of all net assets domiciled in Cayman Connecticut accounted for 11 and California for 7 Illinois and Massachusetts accounted for about 3 each while roughly 2 have been managed in Texas New Jersey and Minnesota respectively CIMA Citation2014 Thus just two greater regions acted as the management location for at least 70 of total assets New YorkBoston including Greenwich and Westport in Connecticut and London From research about the world city network we know that New York and London are the two dominant global financial centers Taylor et al Citation2011 Taylor and Derudder Citation2015 Wjcik Citation2013b  drawing on Strange Citation1998  uses the term the New YorkLondon axis or simply NYLON to describe the joint dominance of these to interconnected financial centers see Norfield Citation2016 for an insightful analysis of Londons role in global finance The extreme concentration of global hedge fund managers in these two greater regions however seems unparalleled with the possible exception of the investment banking industry which is also concentrated in NYLON  and strongly connected to hedge funds The AngloAmerica or Anglosphere approach from IR and IPE seems especially apposite to explain the joint dominance of the USA and the UK in global finance Moreover this approach provides a plausible explanation for the huge size and the specific anatomy of the Cayman OFC that this paper has dissected THE ANGLOAMERICAANGLOSPHERE APPROACH The Anglosphere approach by Vucetic Citation2011 7 builds upon constructivism and conceptualizes the community of the Englishspeaking countries as based on a shared racialized AngloSaxon identity a social kind that exists because people believe it exists Vucetic bases his analysis on historical case studies about crucial interactions between the core countries of the Anglosphere USA UK Canada Australia and New Zealand He deliberately chose episodes that directly concern the field of national security as this domain is commonly theorized to represent the leastlikely case for cooperation between sovereign states in an anarchical system of IRs He argues that it clearly is a puzzle for most conventional IR theories how the AngloAmerican war became unthinkable while peace and cooperation became dependable Vucetic Citation2011 20 Hence there is a particularly high level of trust between Anglophone decisionmakers because they generally do not perceive counterparts from the Anglosphere as an other Gamble Citation2006 9 uses the term AngloAmerica and argues that the Anglophone countries represent an imagined community which has not one distinct center but consists of different states and nations such as Australia Britain Canada Ireland New Zealand Scotland Wales and the United States He argues that AngloAmerica is a political space constituted by wider economic political ideological and cultural relationships Gamble Citation2003 86 Scholars have found empirical evidence for the existence of a specific AngloAmerican model of capitalism Hall and Soskice Citation2001 and Amable Citation2003 argue that the Anglophone economies constitute a distinct socioeconomic model  liberal market economies or marketbased economies in which financial markets play a pivotal role Moreover the legal systems of all Anglophone countries and territories are based on common law which facilitates financial activities within this AngloAmerican transnational space Green Citation2015 has shown that an AngloAmerican developmental sphere was crucial to the development of the pivotal Euromarkets in London which in turn led to a transatlantic regulatory feedback loop that induced wider international financial deregulation Thus AngloAmerica has played a key role for financial globalization The revelations about the unparalleled cooperation by the Anglophone countries in the extremely sensitive field of intelligence dubbed the Five Eyes have corroborated the cogency of the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach significantly McGregor Citation2013 Virtually all international socioeconomic statistics treat the Anglophone countries solely on the grounds where they are located geographically ie the UK is seen as part of Europe Australia as belonging to AsiaPacific and Cayman BVI and others as Caribbean The AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach on the other hand suggests that these states and territories generally have much more in common with other Anglophone countries than with neighboring countries and thus should be analyzed together Research by Heemskerk and Takes Citation2016 supports this view Utilizing community detection through modularity maximization they analyze how the largest one million global corporations are connected through interlocking directorates They find evidence for the existence of a globally dominant North Atlantic  Commonwealth Community which integrates the Anglophone countries Applying the AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach to the Cayman Islands opens new avenues for explaining the extraordinary size and the unique anatomy of this central OFC The fact that Cayman is under British sovereignty has been seen as central by Roberts Citation1995 and Hudson Citation2000 as this status provides political stability What has not been discussed so far is that this political status also provides a high level of trust to the United States the predominant counterparty of Cayman In 2009 London suspended local government in the Turks and Caicos Islands another British dependency and put the governor in charge for two years due to evidence for widespread corruption Reuters Citation2009 see also Clegg Citation2012 Hintjens and Hodge Citation2012 This event demonstrated that the UK will guarantee stability in all of its offshore colonies such as BVI Bermuda Jersey or Cayman which makes them qualitatively different from aspirant OFCs that are independent such as Panama Belize or the Seychelles The development of the Cayman OFC is inextricably linked with its sovereign power the UK In the 1960s the Colonial Office assisted Cayman as well as the BVI and others with the adoption of British laws in order to establish OFCs reportedly to avoid being left with financially dependent territories in the Caribbean Picciotto Citation1992 Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 However British support for the Cayman OFC continued after London ended development aids to Cayman in the mid1970s supposedly because it was thought that Cayman and other British OFCs brought more business to the City of London than they caused tax avoidance in the UK Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 London also played a key role in repeatedly assisting negotiations with Washington when the USA complained about conspicuous deficiencies in Cayman regulations Arguably only this tripartite relation has made it possible that Cayman became the domicile of choice for the hedge fund industry and the largest holder of US securities excluding Treasuries in the world Thus the Cayman Islands can be conceived as a quintessentially AngloAmerican OFC A final key link between AngloAmerica and the Cayman OFC is the advanced business servicesoffshore nexus identified by Wjcik Citation2013a Virtually all leading advanced business services firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers KPMG ErnstYoung and Deloitte as well as most large global law firms are AngloAmerican ie have the majority of their operations in Anglophone countries primarily in NYLON and are often the result of mergers between American and British firms AngloAmerican advanced business services firms have played a pivotal role for the ascent of the Cayman OFC In fact two former heads of the Cayman regulator CIMA have been recruited from such firms which are involved in the creation of most Cayman laws pertaining to finance Freyer and Morriss Citation2013 The nexus between the UK advanced business services and Cayman can be also be inferred from the very high value of British services exports to the Cayman Islands which have amounted to about US35 billion in 2013 ONS Citation2015 This value is higher than British services exports to much larger countries such as Denmark India or Hong Kong The AngloAmericaAnglosphere approach presented in this paper as one plausible explanation for the unique development of the Cayman Islands OFC is related to but also differs from the concept of the Second British Empire by Palan Citation2015 According to that argument the UK dependencies Bermuda BVI Cayman Jersey Guernsey etc but also former colonies such as Cyprus Hong Kong and Singapore form a Second British Empire in finance which is centered on the City of London This concept is indeed very useful to highlight the ancillary role of the UK colonies for the strong position of the City of London in international finance see also Norfield Citation2016 on this point however I would be skeptical to include Hong Kong and Singapore because both are clearly not under the sovereignty of the UK anymore and also compete with the City in certain financial segments The AngloAmericaAnglosphere concept has the advantage to stress the strong transAtlantic financial integration of the City with New York ie NYLON Whereas the term Second British Empire would suggest that London is firmly in control I would argue that in many cases there is a joint AngloAmerican leadership in international finance see Fichtner Citation2016 for a study of the persistent structural power of AngloAmerica in nine key segments of global finance The analysis of the Cayman Islands OFC in this paper shows that while it is an important factor that this jurisdiction is under UK sovereignty Cayman primarily caters to the interests of American and to a lesser degree also Japanese investors and is not as strongly connected to the City of London,business,The Cayman Islands is the world's largest offshore financial centre (OFC) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

established to deliver justice according to law Sometimes justice may stumble but litigants in India can reasonably hope that if they continue the journey on the tortuous path they will get justice eventually With that preface I shall explain a case that has caught the attention of the whole country and stirred passions on either side of the political divide On March 23 2023 a Magistrate in Gujarat convicted Mr Rahul Gandhi of the offence of defamation Section 499 IPC and imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years After pronouncing the sentence the Magistrate suspended the sentence Nonetheless on March 24 Mr Gandhi was disqualified and his seat in the Lok Sabha was declared vacant Here is the path the case travelled 13042019 Mr Gandhi made an election speech in Kolar Karnataka 16042019 Mr Purnesh Modi MLA BJP filed a complaint before a Magistrate in Surat Gujarat that Mr Gandhi had defamed the entire Modi community 07032022 Complainant sought and obtained a stay of the trial of his own complaint from the HC Gujarat 07022023 Mr Gandhis speech in the Lok Sabha on the Adani Groups issues 16022023 Complainant withdrew his Petition before the HC Gujarat 21022023 Trial resumed before the Magistrate 17032023 Trial concluded judgment reserved 23022023 Magistrate delivered a 168page judgment found Mr Gandhi guilty imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment Shortly thereafter the Magistrate suspended the sentence 24032023 Lok Sabha Secretariat notified the disqualification of Mr Gandhi A routine case that meandered for three years suddenly acquired urgency and surged forward at lightning speed from resumption of trial to conviction in 30 days The puzzle is what imparted the urgency Why did the complainant obtain a stay of the trial of his own complaint and why did he nine days after Mr Gandhi spoke in the Lok Sabha withdraw his petition and seek immediate resumption of the stalled trial Who was defamed The complainant alleged that the Modi communitycaste to which he belonged was defamed Frankly I do not know whether there is a community called Modi or if everyone with the surname Modi belonged to one community or caste The Indian Express has explained March 28 2023 that the word Modi does not denote any specific community or caste In Gujarat the Modi surname is used by Hindus Muslims and Parsis There are people with the Modi surname among Vaishnavas Baniyas Kharwas fishermen from Porbandar and Lohanas who are a community of traders The newspaper also found that there is no community or caste by the name Modi in the Central list of OBCs Also there is no Modi in the Central list for Bihar or Rajasthan In the Central list for Gujarat there is Modi Ghanchi For me who had forsworn caste six decades ago and does not recognise caste the entire argument of defaming a communitycaste allegedly 13 crorestrong makes the head spin Punishment Sentence Suspended According to the complaint it was a case of slander Under IPC Section 500 the punishment may extend to imprisonment for 2 years or with fine or with both I know of no case since 1860 when the IPC came into force where the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 2 years was imposed in a case of slander Ordinarily where a sentence of imprisonment for three years or less is imposed the accused is granted bail so that he is a free person to seek relief from a higher court against the conviction and sentence However in this case within minutes of imposing the sentence the Magistrate himself suspended the sentence Advertisement Section 83 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 provides that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction In the case of Mr Gandhi there is a conviction but no sentence that is effective or operating Therefore did he incur a disqualification on March 23 2023 It is a moot question Many have asked the question and are looking for an answer However the powers that be had no doubt whatsoever Within 24 hours whether they had asked the question or not and whether they had found the answer or not the Lok Sabha Secretariat disqualified Mr Gandhi Who can Disqualify Article 1022e of the Constitution of India provides that a person shall be disqualified for being a member if he is disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament Be it noted that the words used are not shall stand disqualified but shall be disqualified implying that an order of disqualification will be necessary The obvious question has been asked by among others Mr PDT Achary former secretary general of the Lok Sabha who has the authority to disqualify Article 103 may contain the answer it says if any question arises the question shall be referred for the decision of the President who shall obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and shall act according to such opinion In Mr Gandhis case the question was not referred to the President nor did the Election Commission offer any opinion So who took the decision Was it the Honble Speaker or a body known as the Lok Sabha Secretariat No one knows Advertisement Adapting Winston Churchill the case and its outcomes so far are riddles wrapped in a mystery,business,In our series of letters from Indian journalists we take a look at the disqualification of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi in a defamation case.

leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament f 6314 chars,Written by Kailash Gupta It is curious to note that the Congress is concentrating on the political side rather than the legal one in the case of Rahul Gandhis disqualification from the Parliament following his conviction by a Surat court in a defamation case Congress leaders have taken to the streets in large numbers instead of going to the higher court to seek relief against the order of the CJM court Talking of the legal aspect many Congress leaders have questioned the action of the Lok Sabha secretariat on the ground that the sentence had been suspended by a month by the trial court itself The alleged undue haste in sending the notice of disqualification to Rahul Gandhi has also come under severe criticism by the Congress leaders Their legal experts have argued that since the sole basis of disqualification is the sentencing for two years jail term hence suspension of the sentence has to be construed to mean an automatic suspension of the disqualification Even before the Surat court pronounced its verdict on March 23 several legal experts had expressed similar opinions and held that there were indeed very dim chances of Rahul losing his parliamentary seat in the likely event of his conviction and sentencing However in truth such experts need to read the relevant legal provisions afresh It is expressly stated in the sub section 3 of section 8 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two yearsshall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release From a bare reading of the relevant provision it is obvious that disqualification results directly from the conviction Actual imprisonment is not a necessary condition for disqualification Further the intent of the lawmakers who enacted the RP Act undoubtedly was to effect disqualification immediately upon conviction on a criminal charge involving sentence of imprisonment or fine as specified in the section 8 of the Act Their intent is evident from the heading of this section which readsDisqualification on conviction for certain offences Also Read  Here is the election speech Rahul Gandhi was convicted and has lost his MP seat for It is interesting to recall the manner in which Rahul Gandhi publicly tore down in September 2013 a copy of the ordinance brought out by the then government headed by Dr Manmohan Singh to circumvent the SC judgment for the purpose of saving subsection 84 of the RP Act At that time Rahul Gandhi was an idealist young leader eager to project himself as the cleanest politician much like his late father Rajiv Gandhi and committed to the cause of purging politics of criminal elements in India Terming the ordinance as an attempt to block the way to decriminalization of politics which had been cleared by the Supreme Court by their judgment in the Lily Thomas case Rahul had expressed his anger and disgust in no uncertain terms and blasted the impugned ordinance That the ordinance had been brought out by the government of his own party made no dent on his resolve to ensure the withdrawal of the ordinance It is indeed an irony that the very same Rahul Gandhi should fall prey to the absence of the very same instrument of law he had opposed so vehemently about a decade back He could not have imagined this development in his wildest dreams while tearing down the impugned ordinance in a press conference held in 2013 This is not the first time that a legislator has lost his seat upon conviction on a criminal charge Rasheed Masood was the first such lawmaker to lose his seat in the Parliament in October 2013 Since then more than 20 other legislators have been disqualified including Vikram Saini Ashok Chandel Kuldeep Senger all of the BJP and Azam Khan of the Samajwadi Party To be fair to Rahul Gandhi it must be conceded that while all these legislators were disqualified on conviction of such heinous crimes as rape of minor and murder he had been held guilty of mere criminal defamation that too for certain words uttered by him during an election speech However as pointed out by eminent lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani the prevailing law so long as the conditions of conviction and sentencing specified in section 8 of the RP Act are fulfilled makes no distinction on the basis of the nature of crime Therefore from a legal point of view there is no merit in the protests of Congressmen on this count However it is high time to make suitable amendments in the law relating to disqualification of members of the parliament and the state legislative assemblies so as to provide for different treatment to the law makers on the basis of the nature of crime they are convicted of It is highly unreasonable to treat someone guilty of defamation by making loose talks at par with those found guilty of rape and murder However talking of the political side of the matter it is obvious that the high moral ground being claimed by Rahul Gandhi and the Congress does not rightfully belong to them in the present political context prevailing in the country His claim of fighting for the democracy in India does not convince anyone in the country in view of the past record of the Congress governments under the leadership of his grandmother who suspended even the fundamental rights of Indian citizens including the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution Indira Gandhi holds a record in dismissing state governments at the drop of a hat including that in the most sensitive state of Jammu and Kashmir The murder of democracy charge was more aptly applicable when the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister NT Rama Rao was dismissed in 1984and was replaced by his finance minister N Bhaskar Rao even when Rama Rao was undergoing treatment in the US Advertisement Similarly the allegation of arrogance Rahul Gandhi is so fond of levelling against the PM does not hold much water given the way Gandhi stubbornly turned down all suggestions to apologise in the courtroom in the case for his defamatory words His claims to be walking in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi is ridiculous It is expected of the leaders of men to be humble enough to apologise when they are obviously in the wrong not to try to turn their follies into virtue with a view to derive political mileage Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh Kailash Gupta former director defence estates Western Command Chandigarh  Kailash Gupta is former director

dittatura dei generali alla democrazia dal blocco culturale alla Korean Wave londa coreana Che Andrew Jackson docente di Korean Studies alla Monash University di Melbourne cos spiega a 7 Durante i quasi 30 anni di dittatura i sudcoreani non potevano viaggiare allestero a meno che non avessero pi di 50 anni appartenessero a una buona famiglia oppure avessero motivi di lavoro o di studio Per avere il visto bisognava pagare un sacco di soldi Uno dei messaggi che i dittatori usavano era cultural blockade  un embargo della cultura Tutto questo fino al 1987 Lanno in cui fu introdotta la democrazia nel 1988 la Corea avrebbe ospitato le Olimpiadi Il professore Jackson racconta che prima di allora la produzione di film uno dei veicoli principali di emancipazione e di crescita era inesistente dallestero ne arrivavano pochissimi da Hollywood da Hong Kong in ogni caso tutti politicamente innocui Ma cerano dei buchi nel muro del regime e qualche film italiano o la nouvelle vague francese arrivava illegalmente Le video cassette venivano duplicate e diffuse ognuno cos creava il proprio cinema un cinema underground La diffusione dei film avveniva nei campus universitari poi i

molto seguita Limportazione della cultura port a un passaggio cruciale cio alla voglia di produrla Tanto che le persone che ora sono ai vertici dellindustria culturale sono le stesse che si autoeducarono in quello spirito di resistenza alla dittatura spiega Jackson Durante il regime ci fu un boom economico e cos nei primi anni 90 persone giovani si ritrovarono con tanti soldi da spendere

relationships and geopolitics surrounding international oil trading continue to evolve a spate of recent transactions and agreements have crated chatter that the petrodollar may be losing its longtime global dominance,The US dollar has been the dominant currency for international oil trades for decades A spate of   recent deals and bilateral agreements involving key oil sellers and buyers has created chat 6158 chars,The US dollar has been the dominant currency for international oil trades for decades A spate of   recent deals and bilateral agreements involving key oil sellers and buyers has created chatter that the petrodollars dominance could be fading getty Following up on last weeks assessment of the rapidly evolving complexion of the world order in crude oil trading a spate of recent oilrelated international deals raises questions about whether the dominance of the petrodollar is evolving as well While no one has been surprised by Russias responding to western sanctions by pressuring its oil buyers to conduct transactions in roubles recent deals made among other nations to conduct trades in crude and petroleum products using other currencies have raised more eyebrows Examples Of Recent Deals So what is all the chatter about Here are a few examples of recent international deals and new alliances that are raising questions about the future of the petrodollar On March 28 Brazil and China two members in the increasingly influential BRICS Alliance announced an agreement to conduct all future trade transactions using their own currencies China ranks as Brazils biggest trading partner On March 8 Reuters reported that Indian customers have paid for most Russian oil in nondollar currencies including the United Arab Emirates dirham and more recently the Russian rouble multiple oil trading and banking sources said On March 29 Saudi Arabia announced it has agreed to become a dialogue partner in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization a Chinaled political economic and security organization designed to compete with similar Western organizations This latest indication of strengthening ties between Saudi Arabia and China came just just weeks after the Kingdom and Iran announced an agreement to reestablish diplomatic relations that had been brokered by China weeks after the Kingdom and Iran announced an agreement to reestablish diplomatic relations that had been brokered by China Also on March 28 French oil giant Total Energies announced it had completed its first purchase of liquefied natural gas LNG from Chinese oil company CNOOC using the Chinese Yuan as the currency These and other agreements conducted in recent months have led to speculation that as oil markets continue to evolve the petrodollar could be losing its influence Some Background While a high percentage of international crude oil trades had long been conducted in US currency the petrodollar was more formally established as the global currency of mark for such trades in 1973 in the wake of the first Arab oil embargo Then the Richard Nixon administration executed an agreement with Saudi Arabian Prince Fand Ibn Abdel Aziz in which the Saudi Kingdom agreed to conduct its oil trades in US dollars in exchange for US military support and hardware The establishment of this arrangement between what at the time were the largest buyer of crude oil the United States and the biggest exporter of the product Saudi Arabia created a paradigm that other importing and exporting nations quickly began to follow Since that time a strong majority of international oil trades have traditionally been conducted in US currency ie the petrodollar Today even amid global tensions shifting international trade arrangements and a spate of new deals to conduct transactions in competing currencies like the Russian rouble and the Chinese Yuan a recent analysis by PhD economist Anas Alhajji managing partner of Energy Outlook Advisors points out that fully 60 of official foreign exchange reserves conducted in Q1 2022 were transacted using US dollars according to IMF data Alhajji adds Yes with the rise of the euro Japans yen and Chinas yuan the US dollar lost some ground but here is the shocker based on the most recent data from the International Monetary Fund IMF the US dollars share is where it was in 1995 What The Future Could Hold Though Russia and a few other oil producing countries have pressured buyers to conduct trades in nondollar currencies for years there is no question that the divisive nature of Vladimir Putins war on Ukraine has caused such pressures to rise In our interview in February SP Global Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin pointed out that just 37 of the worlds 195 countries are enforcing western sanctions applied to Russia exacerbating alreadyextant international divisions Such divisions and pressures to trade outside the petrodollar seem likely to only continue to increase as Russias war lingers on without resolution The ongoing rise of China as a geopolitical power and competitor to US international dominance and the postWWII liberal world order also seems certain to increase pressure on the current petrodollar system The heightening influence of the BRICS Alliance and its plans for expansion seems likely to also result in stronger competition to the US dollar in international trades BRICS members Brazil Russia India China and South Africa voted last year to consider admitting new members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed recently that more than a dozen nations have since expressed an interest in joining the group Saudi Arabia has been frequently mentioned as a likely possibility to make that move Other countries rumored to have expressed an interest include Egypt Indonesia Turkey Thailand and the United Arab Emirates All of these factors could lead to declining influence of the US and its currency in international dealings Still while recognizing all of these factors Alhajji emphatically states that the US dollar is losing ground but it is not losing dominance Bottom Line There can be little doubt that the United States is in the process of gradually pulling back from the role it adopted at the end of WWII to become the worlds global policeman Despite their major rhetorical differences this gradual pulling back has been a prevailing feature of the presidencies of Barack Obama Donald Trump and Joe Biden It is not an accident that the influence of the petrodollar has declined apace with this US pullback For now though diminished the petrodollar remains the dominant currency for trades in oil and petroleum products But that status will continue to evolve along with the ongoing realignment of global trade and geopolitical alliances,business,The US dollar has been the dominant currency for international oil trades for decades

Services   USCIS field office in Tukwila Washington on March 3 2020 Photo by JASON REDMONDAFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Department of Homeland Securitys regulation that allows the spouses of H1B visa holders to work a significant victory for highly skilled foreignborn professionals their families and the companies that employ them US District Judge Tanya S Chutkan granted the defendants DHS motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs Save Jobs USA motion Intervenors Immigration Voice and Anujkumar Dhamija as well as amici curiae comprising more than forty companies and organizations    filed briefs in support of Defendants motion noted the opinion We are thrilled that the Court agreed with our view that the law allows spouses of people here in the United States suffering in decadeslong green card backlogs caused by NationalOrigin based discrimination to at least have the right to work in the United States while they wait in these discriminatory backlogs said Immigration Voice President Aman Kapoor in a statement that referenced percountry limits which lead to longer wait times for employmentbased immigrants from certain countries particularly India The spouses of H1B visa holders now can have a level of assurance that the work authorization granted them in 2015 will be more difficult for future administrations to take away since it is based on a regulation that the court has said is a valid exercise of the power Congress delegated to Homeland Security to set the conditionsincluding work authorizationon admission of nonimmigrants according to William Stock of Klasko Immigration Law Partners Stock notes A future administration would have to go through the notice and comment rulemaking process again and would have to establish that the economic costs of depriving the US workforce of tens of thousands of skilled workers would outweigh any economic benefit asserted from the changed rule This decision confirms that tens of thousands of H4 employeeshighly skilled and critical members of their teamsare lawfully employed said Paul Hughes of McDermott Will  Emery The courts correct analysis follows decades of consistent practice and recognition that the Executive may determine categories of visa holders eligible for employment Hughes drafted the amicus brief for over forty companies and organizations The H4 Rule is lawful noted the brief On the merits Plaintiff has presented no basis to invalidate this enormously consequential rule To the contrary it has been uncontroversial for decades that DHS is empowered to authorize the employment of lawfully admitted noncitizens andparticularly in view of the important interests just describedit exercised that power in an eminently reasonable manner here The companies and organizations that filed the amicus brief included Amazon Apple Business Roundtable US Chamber of Commerce Cisco Systems FWDus Google Intel Microsoft and others H4 Spouses And The Global Battle For Talent Citing the need to compete for global talent in 2015 Obama administration officials issued a rule to allow the spouses of H1B visa holders to work in the United States Under the regulation if an H1B professional husband or wife has an approved immigrant petition I140 a key step in obtaining an employmentbased green card a spouse in H4 dependent status is eligible for an employment authorization document EAD The rule also applies if the H1B professional has waited a year since filing an I140 petition or permanent labor certification and was extending H1B status beyond six years While this regulation has benefited many spouses their families and the US economy it is much more restrictive than Canadas rule which grants work authorization to all spouses of skilled workers wrote economist Madeline Zavodny in a 2022 National Foundation for American Policy NFAP analysis Zavodny estimates almost 90 of the spouses of H1B visa holders have at least a bachelors degree and over half have a graduate degree Zavodny recommended allowing all spouses of H1B visa holders to work USCIS certainly has the authority to extend the ability to work to all H1B spouses And making employment authorization for spouses incident to status would avoid the gaps in employment that spouses have suffered due to USCIS processing delays said Jon Wasden of Wasden Law in a 2022 interview The recent court decision supports Wasdens view H4 employment authorization is critically important to the affected individuals employers like amici and the health of the overall economy according to the companies and organizations represented in the amicus brief The provision of employment authorization to certain H4 visaholders has become by necessity a vital component of the immigration system Not only is this employment authorization immensely significant to the tens of thousands of families that have organized their lives around the availability of H4 employment but it also brings critical benefits to the companies including amici and their members that employ these skilled motivated and vibrant individuals as valued colleagues In all these individuals contribute immediately to Americas overall economy and the nations continued global economic competitiveness Court Rejected Argument DHS Lacks Authority To Provide Work Authorization To H4 Spouses Save Jobs USAs primary argument was Congress never gave DHS the authority to provide work authorization to H4 spouses and other foreign nationals But as the DC Circuit has recently explained that contention runs headlong into the text of the INA decades of Executivebranch practice and both explicit and implicit congressional ratification of that practice according to Judge Chutkans opinion The Circuits analysis in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v United States Department of Homeland Security is directly applicable to this case The DC Circuit squarely rejected the argument that DHS lacked statutory authority to authorize employment as part of Optional Practical Training after an international student graduates school noted the judge The DC Circuits holding and reasoning in Washtech apply with equal force in this case according to Judge Chutkans opinion Like the Optional Practical Training program at issue there Defendant promulgated the H4 Rule here pursuant to its timeandconditions and general regulatory authority as confirmed by IRCA Immigration Reform and Control Act    In short Congress has expressly and knowingly empowered Defendant to authorize employment as a permissible condition of an H4 spouses stay in the United States The opinion cites the amicus brief from businesses and organizations DHS and its predecessors have authorized employment not just for students but also for their spouses and dependents For instance DHS has long extended work authorization to spouses of foreign government officials and spouses of employees or officers of international organizations Rather than refuting the straightforward interpretation of the INA Immigration and Nationality Act that permits DHS to exercise that authority Congress has repeatedly blessed it by leaving the relevant provisions of the INA untouched even as it as amended other portions of the statute during the last several decades That constitutes persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress Mindful of controlling precedent in this Circuit this court will not disturb it Court Rejected Plaintiffs Argument On Separation Of Powers And Nondelegation Doctrine Judge Chutkan rejected Save Jobs USAs contention that the H4 regulation violates the separation of powers and nondelegation doctrine citing the WashTech decision which explained how the INAs text and structure establishes the limiting principle to constrain DHSs regulatory authority According to the Washtech opinion pursuant to the Secretarys obligation to exercise its rulemaking power in keeping with the statutes text and structure DHS must ensure that the times and conditions it attaches to the admission of nonimmigrant visaholders are reasonably related to the purpose for which they were permitted to enter Judge Chutkan writes The H4 Rule satisfies that statutory requirement But the requirements mere existence provides an intelligible principle of delegation and is therefore fatal to Plaintiffs nondelegation challenge Court Rejected Argument H4 Rule Is Arbitrary And Capricious Judge Chutkan rejected the argument that the H4 regulation is arbitrary and capricious Plaintiff argues that the H4 Rule reversed without explanation a prior policy established by Congress and DHSie that H4 spouses had no work authorization according to Judge Chutkan The court disagrees As Washtech explained the INA empowers but does not require Defendant to set certain conditions of nonimmigrant visaholders stay in the United States potentially including work authorization Defendants choice to exercise its statutory discretion did not change that policy After Defendant and Intervenors made the same argument in their briefing Plaintiff failed to respond Judge Chutkan wrote that the defendant DHS explained why it decided to authorize work authorization for H4 spouses In doing so Defendant also demonstrated how the H4 Rule is reasonably related to the nature and purpose of the H4 visa class Plaintiff Save Jobs USA initially contends that Defendant entirely failed to consider the negative effect that the H4 Rule could have on American workers according to Judge Chutkans opinion Plaintiff recognizesas it mustthat Defendant did consider that effect and instead takes aim at Defendants methodology for doing so Defendant calculated that even if every eligible H4 spouse took advantage of the rule in the first year the year with the most newlyeligible H4 spouses it would amount to less than 012 of the US workforce notes Judge Chutkan By contrast Defendant noted that commenters predicting negative impacts on American jobs did not provide any empirical support for that prediction In light of that data Defendant concluded that the H4 Rules benefits outweighed its minimal economic costs That suffices to establish a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made    Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the H4 Rule was arbitrary and capricious The summary judgment in favor of H4 spouses DHS and employers is expected to benefit families employers and the US economy The ruling places on firmer legal grounds the ability of DHS to provide work authorization to the spouses of H1B visa holders,business,A federal judge ruled in favour of the Department of Homeland Security regulation that allows the spouses of H1B visa holders to work a significant victory for highly skilled foreignborn professionals their families and the companies that employ them

einer Seite lesen Mit Truppen und viel Geld sollten Demokratie Aufschwung und Frauenrechte nach Afghanistan kommen Trotz einiger kurzfristiger Verbesserungen endete der Einmarsch im Desaster Eine Bilanz die zeigt warum Afghanistans innere Widersprche haben sich immer wieder in der externen Machtagenda verfangen Besonders seine Nachbarn spielen dabei eine destabilisierende Rolle Gemeinsame ethnische Zugehrigkeiten ber Grenzen hinweg haben den Spielplan der Nachbarn erleichtert die ethnische Karte im darauffolgenden Stellvertreterkrieg zu ihrem Vorteil zu nutzen Es berrascht nicht dass Afghanistan seit den 1970erJahren Zeuge von EthnoStammeskriegen geworden ist Das Land ist auch seit Jahrzehnten den Eingriffen externer Mchte ausgesetzt was es zum Schauplatz eines neuen groen Spiels macht Es war ein Labor fr viele Experimente der internationalen Gemeinschaft von denen nur wenige realisiert wurden Externe Akteure haben neue Strategien implementiert gescheiterte Experimente hinter sich gelassen und es den Afghanen berlassen die Scherben aufzusammeln Fr das Verstndnis der sich entfaltenden Krise in Afghanistan kommt der Analyse externer Mchte entscheidende Bedeutung zu Whrend der zwei Jahrzehnte internationaler Intervention in Afghanistan nach dem Sturz des TalibanRegimes im Jahr 2001 wurden erhebliche Fortschritte in den Bereichen MdchenFrauen Minderheitenrechte Demokratie und Menschenrechte erzielt Dieser Beitrag erschien zuerst in der Monatszeitschrift Welttrends Die Wirtschaft des Landes erholte sich Allerdings wurde dies hauptschlich durch internationale Hilfe und Untersttzung erreicht  was die Gewinne im Wesentlichen fragil machte Die Art der internationalen Intervention mit ihrer Betonung auf Projekten mit hoher Sichtbarkeit und schneller Wirkung bot nicht den langfristigen Aufbau von Institutionen die zur Stabilisierung des Landes erforderlich sind Stattdessen hat es sowohl fr die Regierung als auch fr die internationale Gemeinschaft eine Legitimittskrise geschaffen weil es die Grundbedrfnisse der Brger wie Sicherheit Gesundheit Beschftigung und Justiz in den lndlichen Gebieten nicht erfllt hat Die Taliban nutzten diese Legitimittskrise aus  wobei der Aufstand in den abgelegenen Gebieten des Sdens und Ostens wo die Reichweite der Regierung begrenzt war die Untersttzung der Bevlkerung fand Die bernahme von Kabul am 15 August 2021 war daher fr langjhrige Beobachter keine berraschende Entwicklung insbesondere nach der Unterzeichnung des Friedensabkommens der USA mit den Taliban am 29 Februar 2020 Die Zeichen standen seitdem an der Wand Die faktische Abwesenheit der afghanischen Regierung in der Anfangsphase des Friedensprozesses hatte sie weiter geschwcht und unfhig gemacht aus einer Position der Strke heraus mit den Taliban zu verhandeln Nach der bernahme durch die Taliban ist Afghanistan mit einer schweren wirtschaftlichen und humanitren Krise konfrontiert Die USA und die internationale Gemeinschaft scheinen nach ihrem Abzug die Afghanen wieder vergessen zu haben Die Ukraine und der IndoPazifik ziehen die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich Vor diesem Hintergrund steht meine kritische Untersuchung der Rolle der internationalen Gemeinschaft in Afghanistan in einer Reihe von Sektoren  Sicherheit Demokratie und politische Rechenschaftspflicht und schlielich Wirtschaftsmanagement und Regierungsfhrung UnSicherheit DemokratieResistenz Misswirtschaft Erstens ist im Sicherheitssektor offensichtlich dass die Vereinigten Staaten kein Konzept eines Endstaates in Afghanistan hatten selbst als enorme Ressourcen in das Land flossen Ihr Projekt zur Stabilisierung Afghanistans entbehrte einer konkreten Vision Sie schufen eine groe afghanische Nationalarmee nach konventionellen Grundstzen rsteten sie jedoch nicht fr die Herausforderungen des Aufstands aus Probleme wie Korruption Desertionen unzureichende Ausbildung und Waffen haben die Afghan National Defence and Security Forces ANDSF whrend ihrer gesamten Existenz geplagt Es berrascht nicht dass die Afghan National Army ANA und die ANDSF nach der Unterzeichnung des DohaAbkommens noch vor dem Fall Kabuls im August 2021 rasch begannen sich aufzulsen Das ausgehandelte Abzugsdatum gab den Taliban die Oberhand und die Bedingungen des Friedensabkommens sorgten fr enorme Verwirrung unter den afghanischen Sicherheitskrften Fr viele ANDSFMitarbeiter schienen die Bedingungen zu bedeuten dass der Staat die Taliban in der Zwischenzeit nicht bekmpfen sollte Dies wiederum fhrte zu einer Legitimitts und Moralkrise Desertionen und schlielich zum Zusammenbruch des Sicherheitssektors Zweitens war Afghanistan in Bezug auf Demokratie und politische Struktur nicht bereit fr das von der internationalen Gemeinschaft propagierte westliche Demokratieverstndnis Es hatte seine eigenen traditionellen demokratischen Institutionen die in dem Eifer dem Land eine moderne Demokratie aufzuzwingen umgangen wurden Aber das demokratische Experiment schloss Rechenschaftspflicht oder Vertretung im eigentlichen Sinne des Wortes aus Dies wurde insbesondere durch die wiederholten Betrugsvorwrfe deutlich die die Prsidentschaftswahlen 2014 und 2019 beeintrchtigten Als Wahlbeobachter fr eine der Prsidentschaftswahlen wurde ich Zeuge einer wachsenden Unzufriedenheit der Bevlkerung ab 2014 als die Menschen begannen ernsthaften Unmut ber die Wahlergebnisse zu uern die ihre Entscheidungen auer Kraft gesetzt zu haben schienen Infolgedessen wurde die Legitimitt der afghanischen Regierung nicht nur von den Taliban sondern von der Bevlkerung selbst infrage gestellt Die tiefe Polarisierung innerhalb der Regierung der Nationalen Einheit NUG lhmte die Regierung und wirkte sich auf ihre Fhigkeit aus Gesetze rechtzeitig zu formulieren und zu erlassen Die Unterzeichnung des Friedensabkommens mit den Taliban durch die USA diskreditierte die afghanische Regierung weiter und fhrte zu einer schweren Legitimittskrise Drittens verlieen sich die afghanische Wirtschaft und der nationale Handel auf die Hilfe und Untersttzung der internationalen Gemeinschaft Weit davon entfernt sich in Richtung einer autarken Wirtschaft der internen Einkommensgenerierung und der Ausbeutung natrlicher Ressourcen zu bewegen hat die Etablierung einer von Hilfe abhngigen Wirtschaft eine Generation von Eliten und einen Rentierstaat geschaffen Die Eliten haben whrend ihres Aufenthalts im Land Vorteile daraus gezogen einen Groteil ihrer Einknfte aus dem Land geleitet und das Land in den Wochen und Monaten vor der bernahme durch die Taliban verlassen Der Mangel an Einnahmen alternativen Lebensgrundlagen und anderen wirtschaftlichen Mglichkeiten veranlasste viele Afghanen den Mohnanbau wieder aufzunehmen undoder sich dem Aufstand anzuschlieen Ebenso behinderte trotz des enormen Potenzials im Mineralsektor das Fehlen von Regierungsinitiativen die allgemeine Sicherheitslage und der Mangel an regionaler Zusammenarbeit und Konnektivitt die Realisierung des nationalen Potenzials fr Entwicklung Einkommensgenerierung und Beschftigung Projekte wie die Mes AynakKupferminen die 20072008 dem chinesischen Unternehmen

analysis International body the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply CIPS called on the government to better enforce critical transparency rules that are being ignored Just 29 per cent of organisations required to produce a modern slavery statement have submitted it to the government registry for 2022 the CIPS found Companies with a turnover of more than 36m a year are required to publish an annual statement outlining the steps they are making to address slavery in supply chains according to the UKs Modern Slavery Act 2015 They are also strongly encouraged to submit statements to the Home Offices modern slavery statement registry although it is not mandatory But the registry saw just 8074 statements submitted in 2022 a sharp 46 per cent drop from the 15019 submitted the previous year the CIPS found It is despite more than a third of organisations saying they think modern slavery abuses are most likely to occur in the UK as part of their supply chain followed by 18 per cent who said China and less than a 10th who said India according to data from the registry The CIPS noted that companies have a grace period of six months to produce 2022s statement but said efforts to submit statements could be waning without more pressure from the government David Taylor chief operating officer for the CIPS said It is an open secret that vulnerable adults and children are exploited every day to produce the goods and services we consume Organisations are facing enormous pressures across their supply chains and in these circumstances it might be tempting to turn a blind eye to modern slavery and prioritise other challenges But it is precisely during times of economic hardship that we must be vigilant and keep up our efforts to tackle this issue He added that the data is a vital resource to help tackle modern slavery but is currently being ignored Furthermore almost a quarter of the statements submitted last year lacked basic information about the steps being taken such as including measurable goals The government is expected to introduce a new modern slavery bill to parliament this year that would make submissions to the registry mandatory for qualifying businesses But the body pointed out that the government has not appointed someone to fill the post of independent antislavery commissioner since April last year a role required to scrutinise legislation and hold companies to account Dame Sara Thornton a modern slavery professor at Nottingham University and former commissioner said While we wait for new modern slavery legislation and a new independent antislavery commissioner too many instances of exploitation abuse and harm will be allowed to continue unseen That is where our real failure lies she stressed The analysis comes as Prime minister Rishi Sunak received criticism this week over his flagship immigration reforms which could make it harder for modern slavery and trafficking victims to come forward amid the risk of deportation Former prime minister Theresa May appealed for such victims to be excluded from measures within the Illegal Migration Bill which seeks to remove protections for people who are judged to have entered the UK illegally Mrs May warned the bill will drive a coach and horses through the Modern Slavery Act denying support to those who have been exploited and enslaved Home

School de la Universidad de Pennsylvania Trabaj 26 aos en el Citigroup en distintos pases incluyendo la Argentina Uruguay y Japn donde fue CEO Actualmente es el presidente y CEO de la calificadora SP Douglas Peterson tiene ms de 30 aos de experiencia en el mercado financiero internacional Trabaj durante dos dcadas para el Citi desde varios pases entre ellos la Argentina estuvo entre 1986 y 1988 Tambin estuvo en Japn como CEO del Citi en 2004 Desde 2011 trabaja en la calificadora de riesgo SP y desde 2013 es su presidente y CEO Peterson visita nuestro pas dos o tres veces al ao No solo por su trabajo sino tambin porque est casado con una argentina Normalmente vamos a Buenos Aires para fin de ao y despus hacemos una semana de turismo El lugar que ms me sorprendi fue el Lago Argentino y el glaciar Perito Moreno Hemos ido a Bariloche y a la Pennsula Valds dice en una entrevista con LA NACION hecha en Houston en el marco de la CERAWeek by SP Global Segn el ltimo informe de SP Global las fuertes turbulencias recientes en los mercados financieros interrumpieron una desaceleracin que se evaluaba como relativamente ordenada y necesaria de la economa occidental El impacto macro parece limitado por ahora La respuesta poltica fue contundente en Estados Unidos y Europa y los mercados se han calmado pero siguen nerviosos Nuestro pronstico y narrativa de referencia se mantienen prcticamente sin cambios para las economas avanzadas dice la calificadora que dirige Peterson Por otro lado proyecta que los bancos centrales seguirn subiendo las tasas en respuesta a las perspectivas macroeconmicas a pesar de las recientes turbulencias El pronstico de inflacin base y las expectativas de inflacin se mantienen por encima del objetivo para la mayora de los bancos centrales este ao y el prximo Esto implica que las condiciones financieras deben endurecerse an ms lo que a su vez requiere tasas de poltica ms altas a menos que el propio mercado haga el endurecimiento por ejemplo a travs de estndares crediticios ms estrictos Reiteramos nuestra opinin anterior de que dada la falla en el pronstico de inflacin en 2021 los bancos centrales tendern a pecar de cautelosos y se inclinarn hacia tasas ms altas y condiciones ms estrictas para llevar la inflacin de regreso a la meta Volver a quedarse atrs de la curva no sera bueno para la credibilidad indica Cmo ve este ao la economa para la Argentina y los mercados emergentes Estados Unidos tiene condiciones muy diferentes a lo normal porque hay muy bajo desempleo pero por otro lado tiene que seguir subiendo las tasas de inters dada la inflacin que para Estados Unidos est muy alta en 6 si se tiene en cuenta que viene de 10 o 12 aos de cero Habr recesin En la pandemia entre lo que el Gobierno le dio a la gente y a los negocios en subsidios muchos se quedaron en sus casas mirando televisin sin hacer nada sin viajar Por lo tanto hoy hay una gran capacidad de inversin y de gasto que todava no se ha terminado Hay gente gastando en viajes en ropa nueva en salidas a comer en remodelacin de sus casas Hay una gran demanda por eso no se ve todava la recesin Por otro lado los restaurantes y hoteles no tienen la cantidad de empleados suficientes para sus negocios Les falta gente Por eso no vemos recesin sigue el gasto muy alto de los consumidores y el desempleo est muy bajo Sin embargo hay una preocupacin de que eso pueda cambiar S porque la Reserva Federal est subiendo la tasa de inters y la teora dice que cuando se llega a un cierto nmero ser muy caro pedir un prstamo y eso llevar a una recesin Todo al rea de vivienda y construccin se volver muy caro y la economa empezar a caer Esa es la teora En un pas como la Argentina si la economa marcha bien el consumo crece y el desempleo es bajo el gobierno pedira no tocar nada no subir la tasa de inters Por qu pese a que la economa crece los bancos centrales estn dispuestos a desacelerar la economa para bajar la inflacin La inflacin es un impuesto a la gente ms pobre La aceleracin de precios es ms alta en combustibles alquileres y comida de entre 8 y 10 interanual por arriba del 6 de inflacin promedio en Estados Unidos Una persona que come paga el alquiler y usa el auto para ir al trabajo tiene una inflacin de 10 Los otros componentes de la inflacin como el celular o el enchufe no suben tienen una tasa de 1 o 2 interanual As que la gente con ms recursos no tiene tanta inflacin como la ms pobre Tener inflacin muy alta es un impuesto social En este momento en Estados Unidos la Fed tiene dos propsitos que el desempleo se mantenga bajo y que la inflacin baje a 2 anual Ese es su mandato Pero los polticos podran temer que si enfran la economa no los van a votar ms S pero por otro lado los polticos gobiernan a los ciudadanos cuyos gastos suben ms que sus salarios El precio de los huevos por ejemplo se duplic y es un alimento que comen mucho las personas con menores ingresos Lo mismo con la nafta la carne o ir a McDonalds Todo subi mucho entre 30 y 40 en los ltimos tres aos y los salarios no han subido As que hay mucha presin sobre los polticos por la inflacin Los polticos podran decir que la inflacin no es culpa de ellos Pero el pueblo va a decir que es culpa del gobierno porque puso demasiada moneda en circulacin En el corto plazo es un costo poltico bajar la inflacin Lo que pasa es que no hemos tenido inflacin desde los aos 70 Es casi un experimento ver cmo bajar la inflacin Lo que quieren hacer es poner el hilo a travs de la aguja Es muy difcil porque quieren subir la tasa de inters a cierto nivel y que baje un poco la actividad pero no tanto para que no haya problemas con el desempleo y con el crecimiento Es muy difcil es como una ciruga Por qu cree que la Argentina nunca logr resolver su problema de inflacin Yo no soy economista as que no quiero decir que soy un experto Pero la Argentina tuvo inflacin desde hace muchos aos por su dficit fiscal En este momento y durante muchos aos para poder pagar los gastos del Gobierno y los subsidios estuvo imprimiendo billetes Douglas Peterson La tecnologa es un tema global la Argentina tiene muy buenos tcnicos e ingenieros que pueden trabajar desde el pas archivo Estados Unidos tambin tienen dficit fiscal hace aos Pero no es tan grande Adems Estados Unidos tiene el dlar como moneda de reserva Eso quiere decir que siempre habr compra de dlares a nivel mundial porque se usa para todas las transacciones internacionales Eso le da cierta fuerza Tambin tiene un dficit sostenible hasta ahora El dficit de los ltimos aos fue mucho ms alto por eso tambin tenemos inflacin ahora porque en la pandemia hubo unos gastos muy altos para mantener la economa La actividad baj como 20 de golpe cuando todo el mundo se qued en la casa y por eso subi mucho el dficit Ahora tienen que buscar la manera de bajar el dficit Este aumento de tasas de inters cmo impactar en los mercados emergentes Est impactando Un pas que se financia en dlares y no hablo del caso puntual de la Argentina como subi el costo del dlar si importa comida y energa en este momento todo eso aument Ciertos pases como Sri Lanka que importan todo estn empezando a tener una crisis financiera La Argentina por suerte tiene comida y energa que son reas estratgicas muy fuertes son oportunidades Pero tiene dficit fiscal y el problema de la moneda Qu es lo que ms temen los inversores de la Argentina Nosotros tenemos una oficina muy exitosa en la Argentina as que depende un poco de lo que est buscando la empresa o el individuo Por supuesto en cualquier lugar del mundo cuando se invierten se buscan certezas desde el punto de vista legal de que se puede invertir y despus retirar los fondos Pero la Argentina en este momento tiene muchas oportunidades Tendra que ser el siglo de la Argentina Dnde estn las oportunidades Hay oportunidades de energa por el lado del gas y de todas las fuentes renovables minerales litio cobre La agricultura ya es muy fuerte pero con valor agregado podra ser ms fuerte an con el trigo los lcteos los limones y otros ctricos el vino Otra rea es la de servicios Nosotros tenemos una oficina en la Argentina con 400 personas desde donde exportamos servicios a clientes pero tambin los vendemos internamente Tenemos empleados argentinos sper capaces a nivel mundial Algunos se han ido del pas y estn en otros lugares El pas tambin tiene para desarrollar el turismo Es un lugar que todo el mundo quiere visitar Desde que ganamos la copa del mundo Risas Exactamente Es un pas muy atractivo para el viajero porque tiene para visitar desde la Patagonia hasta Iguaz y muchos lugares en el medio como Bariloche Mendoza la costa la ciudad de Buenos Aires Hace muchos aos escuchamos que la Argentina tiene muchas oportunidades y sin embargo pasan los aos y seguimos en una crisis que parece interminable A qu cree que se debe No soy experto en el rea poltica Creo que la Argentina necesita de liderazgo para poder hacer ese cambio y lograr su potencial Pero se nos puede pasar el tren Usted hablaba de las oportunidades en energa por ejemplo pero podemos perder el inters de los inversores No la energa es un sector donde todo el mundo est buscando oportunidades para hacer el cambio a renovables Mientras tanto vamos a necesitar gas en la transicin para pasar de carbn o petrleo a gas La Argentina tiene Vaca Muerta tiene uno de los depsitos de litio ms grandes del mundo Tiene algo de cobre no muy explorado Gas y litio hay y estos son dos elementos muy importantes para la transicin Cmo cree que seguir la guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y China Yo no lo llamo una guerra sino una tensin porque en cuanto al comercio exterior la relacin ms grande de China sigue siendo con los Estados Unidos Los dos pases se necesitan pero hay tensin por muchos lados Creo que s va a cambiar un poco el panorama para un pas como la Argentina En este momento hay dos tendencias a nivel mundial que tambin pueden favorecer a la Argentina desde el punto de vista de la relacin con Estados Unidos que son el nearshoring onshoring o friendshoring el intercambio comercial con destinos ms cercanos Hay muchas empresas que tenan muy concentrada su produccin en China y ahora buscan nuevos socios para producir Los que han aprovechado ms esa situacin son Vietnam Filipinas Tailandia e India Mxico tambin lo ha aprovechado y un pas como la Argentina tambin podra hacer uso del nearshoring Por otro lado en cuanto a la tecnologa este ser un tema muy global y la Argentina tiene muy buenos tcnicos e ingenieros que pueden trabajar desde el pas Hay unas tendencias que tienen que ver con esta diversificacin que aprendims en pandemia Puede haber produccin por todo el mundo,business,El presidente y CEO de la calificadora SP Douglas

Street Journal reporter who 5158 chars,Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan whom the statement said was wrongfully detained US officials said they were considering a similar determination for Gershkovich that could be made at any time Should that happen his case would be largely transferred to the office of the US Special Presidential for Hostage Affairs In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release WASHINGTON  Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan  the State Department said Sunday Advertisement Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was let him go Advertisement The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editor in chief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation US consular officials have requested a visit with Gershkovich but no announcement of such access has been made Officials said they were hopeful consular access could be arranged in the coming week but could not speak to when that might happen Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Representative Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee noted that the government has advised US citizens to leave Russia This is not unexpected in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following Turner an Ohio Republican told CNNs State of the Union Advertisement In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of basketball star Brittney Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the chance of progress in US efforts to free its detained citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized On Saturday night Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram Interactions between the top US and Russian diplomats have been rare since Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 though they did have a brief conversation last month on the sidelines of the Group of 20 conference of foreign ministers in India It was the highestlevel inperson talks between the two countries since the war Advertisement That interaction was their first contact since last summer when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a US proposal for Russia to release Whelan and Griner Though Whelan was not included in the oneforone swap that resulted in the release of Griner US officials said they remain committed to bringing him home,business,US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged his Russian counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street
