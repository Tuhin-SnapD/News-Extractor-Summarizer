https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/apr/02/how-michael-vaughan-left-most-cricket-fans-pining-for-his-england-days,How Michael Vaughan left most cricket fans pining for his England days  Andy Bull,Since the triumphs of his playing career the Asheswinning captain has struggled to find a meaningful niche in cricketI keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk ,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot o 5980 chars,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot on one of those disposable plastic cameras but you can still pick out the players making their way around the boundary Theres Andrew Flintoff one arm above his head Marcus Trescothick holding the little crystal replica of the urn Steve Harmison one hand throttling a bottle of champagne and Michael Vaughan dapper despite his tired whites He has an England flag knotted around his neck It hangs down his back like a cape It was taken at about a quartertoseven in the evening on 12 September half an hour or so after the umpires had called off play on the final day of one of the greatest Test series when England had beaten one of the best teams to play the game to win back the Ashes after 16 years They say cricket doesnt build character but reveals it But you wonder how many of the millions who watched that series really had anything like a clear idea of the personalities of the men playing in it Fans are romantics after all and make heroes of their favourite players In the years afterwards we would get to know a little more about them all Trescothick and Flintoff who had seemed to be such easy and convivial people opened up about their struggles with mental illness We had Vaughan all wrong too There were no great revelations rather a gradual unfolding of himself in his television and radio work and on social media Still over time the gap between the Vaughan we saw in 2005 and the one we have come to know in the years since came to seem an awful lot wider than the 100odd yards between the grandstand seats and the pitch where we watched him go about his batting For an 18month stretch in the early 2000s he did that as well in Test cricket as any Englishman ever has 100 197 195 against India at home 177 145 183 against Australia away and altogether more runs than anyone but Viv Richards had ever made in a single year All in matinee idol style with a high elbow a handsome drive and a withering pull The captaincy took the edge off his form but England gained something better anyway As a young man at Yorkshire Vaughan studied the senior players around him Martyn Moxon David Byas Darren Lehmann

Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply after newsletter promotion As Englands captain he seemed again to combine the best qualities from people who had done it before him From this side of the boundary he appeared to have a fertile mind a feel for people a keen sense of when and whether to take risks a bullish selfconfidence and when he needed it a steady bat If you could have frozen his life in that moment in the late summer of 2005 he would be remembered now only as one of Englands very best captains His winning percentage a lick under 51 is second only to Mike Brearleys among people who did the job often Perhaps Vaughans great strength was that he was such a good blusterer he managed to convince what was in reality an utterly outmatched England team that they were capable of beating an Australia side including in Shane Warne Glenn McGrath Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist a good handful of the truly great players Michael Vaughan waves to the crowd after beating Australia in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge in 2005 Photograph Gareth CopleyPA There were signs of what was behind the bluff during his retirement years which were oddly needy There was a tearful press conference when he stepped down as captain and an awkward 11month stretch when he insisted he still wanted to play on that ended in a row with Yorkshires former chief executive in a car park outside Headingley after the club refused to indulge him in a farewell run of games for their oneday team It was followed by a string of embarrassing commercial deals including a stretch when he was busy flogging artworks he had made by flinging cricket balls at a canvas It felt as if Vaughans ego had convinced him that having achieved as much as he did in the sport his life after it owed him more than he had received He inevitably drifted into punditry where he could be brilliantly insightful when he was talking about the sport and an awful bore when he wasnt Other England captains from his era shaped second careers as writers analysts and administrators Vaughan apparently lost for anything better to do tried to make his way as a media personality He seemed to think the trick of it was in being witty which he isnt and offering provocative takes on hot topics He is you guess one of the few people left using the word banter without irony His most egregious tweets came up all over again during these Cricket Discipline Commission hearings which cleared him on Friday of using racist andor discriminatory language and bringing the game into disrepute Vaughan now says the words were disgusting and awful and other words you could use It wasnt clear if he was thinking of the one that feels most appropriate for them stupid Vaughans act wore thin long before he finally seemed to realise that the only reaction it provoked in most cricket fans was to make them pine for that time back in 2005 But even here theres a sense that our idea of him isnt quite right that hes still playing games Hes just not as good at them as he used to be at the one that made him famous to begin with Ask his friends and he has plenty in and out of the game and they will tell you about a thoughtful talented and affectionate man full of bright ideas You can only hope he decides to show it to the rest of us,All photographs subject to copyright.,business

counterpart in a rare phone call between the diplomats since the Ukraine war to immediately release a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained last week as well as another imprisoned American Paul Whelan the State Department said Sunday In the call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Blinken conveyed grave concern over the Kremlins detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations according to a State Department summary of the call Blinken called for his immediate release Advertisement Blinken also sought the immediate release of Whelan whom the statement said was wrongfully detained US Secretary of State Antony Blinken seen last month has urged his Russian counterpart to immediately release reporter Evan Gershkovich on espionage allegations ANDREW HARNIK via Getty Images Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless He is serving a 16year sentence Blinken and Lavrov also discussed the importance of creating an environment that permits diplomatic missions to carry out their work according to the State Department Advertisement The FSB Russias top security agency and successor to the KGB said Gershkovich was collecting information on an enterprise of the militaryindustrial complex Russian authorities detained him last week the first time a US correspondent has been held on spying accusations since the Cold War In its summary of the call Russias foreign ministry said Lavrov drew Blinkens attention to the need to respect the decisions of the Russian authorities about Gershkovich whom Moscow claims without evidence was caught redhanded The Journal has adamantly denied the allegations and demanded his release US officials have also called on Russia to let him go with President Joe Biden telling reporters on Friday that his message to the country was Let him go The Kremlin said Lavrov also told Blinken it was unacceptable for US officials and Western news media to continue whipping up excitement and politicizing the journalists detention His further fate will be determined by the court The State Department described the detention of Gershkovich as unacceptable Emma Tucker the newspapers editorinchief said it was gratifying and reassuring to learn of Blinkens call because it shows the US government is taking the case right up to the top The Journal has been unable to get messages to the reporter or learn any official information about him she told CBS Face the Nation Advertisement Tucker said the newspaper is hopeful a lawyer might be able to meet with Gershkovich this coming week and in the meantime has been pressing constantly for reassurance that hes not being mistreated in any way Rep Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee noted that the government has advised US citizens to leave Russia This is not unexpected in that Russia is acting as an illegal state at this point There are no laws or rules or no international norms that they are following Turner ROhio told CNNs State of the Union In alleging that US officials and news media are hyping Gershkovichs detention Russian officials are reprising a theme they used in the apprehensions of Griner and other US citizens The Kremlin has said it prefers to resolve such cases quietly and has emphasized the need to follow Russias judicial process Often that means the likelihood of progress in US efforts to free detained its citizens isnt likely until formal charges are filed a trial is held a conviction is obtained and sentencing and appeals are completed More than 30 news organizations and press freedom advocates have written the Russian ambassador in the United States to express concern Russia is sending the message that reporting inside the country is criminalized And on Saturday night basketball star Brittney Griner who was detained for 10 months by Russian authorities before being released in a prisoner swap for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout issued a statement with her wife Cherelle calling for the release of the 31yearold Gershkovich Advertisement Every American who is taken is ours to fight for and every American returned is a win for us all the couple said in a statement posted on Instagram Interactions between the top US and Russian

triumph,A routine case that meandered for three years suddenly acquired urgency and surged forward at lightning speed from resumption of trial to conviction in 30 days,Courts are established to deliver justice according to law Sometimes justice may stumble but litigants in India can reasonably hope that if they continue the journey on the tortuous path they wil 5169 chars,Courts are established to deliver justice according to law Sometimes justice may stumble but litigants in India can reasonably hope that if they continue the journey on the tortuous path they will get justice eventually With that preface I shall explain a case that has caught the attention of the whole country and stirred passions on either side of the political divide On March 23 2023 a Magistrate in Gujarat convicted Mr Rahul Gandhi of the offence of defamation Section 499 IPC and imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years After pronouncing the sentence the Magistrate suspended the sentence Nonetheless on March 24 Mr Gandhi was disqualified and his seat in the Lok Sabha was declared vacant Here is the path the case travelled 13042019 Mr Gandhi made an election speech in Kolar Karnataka 16042019 Mr Purnesh Modi MLA BJP filed a complaint before a Magistrate in Surat Gujarat that Mr Gandhi had defamed the entire Modi community 07032022 Complainant sought and obtained a stay of the trial of his own complaint from the HC Gujarat 07022023 Mr Gandhis speech in the Lok Sabha on the Adani Groups issues 16022023 Complainant withdrew his Petition before the HC Gujarat 21022023 Trial resumed before the Magistrate 17032023 Trial concluded judgment reserved 23022023 Magistrate delivered a 168page judgment found Mr Gandhi guilty imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment Shortly thereafter the Magistrate suspended the sentence 24032023 Lok Sabha Secretariat notified the disqualification of Mr Gandhi A routine case that meandered for three years suddenly acquired urgency and surged forward at lightning speed from resumption of trial to conviction in 30 days The puzzle is what imparted the urgency Why did the complainant obtain a stay of the trial of his own complaint and why did he nine days after Mr Gandhi spoke in the Lok Sabha withdraw his petition and seek immediate resumption of the stalled trial Who was defamed The complainant alleged that the Modi communitycaste to which he belonged was defamed Frankly I do not know whether there is a community called Modi or if everyone with the surname Modi belonged to one community or caste The Indian Express has explained March 28 2023 that the word Modi does not denote any specific community or caste In Gujarat the Modi surname is used by Hindus Muslims and Parsis There are people with the Modi surname among Vaishnavas Baniyas Kharwas fishermen from Porbandar and Lohanas who are a community of traders The newspaper also found that there is no community or caste by the name Modi in the Central list of OBCs Also there is no Modi in the Central list for Bihar or Rajasthan In the Central list for Gujarat there is Modi Ghanchi For me who had forsworn caste six decades ago and does not recognise caste the entire argument of defaming a communitycaste allegedly 13 crorestrong makes the head spin Punishment Sentence Suspended According to the complaint it was a case of slander Under IPC Section 500 the punishment may extend to imprisonment for 2 years or with fine or with both I know of no case since 1860 when the IPC came into force where the maximum sentence of imprisonment for 2 years was imposed in a case of slander Ordinarily where a sentence of imprisonment for three years or less is imposed the accused is granted bail so that he is a free person to seek relief from a higher court against the conviction and sentence However in this case within minutes of imposing the sentence the Magistrate himself suspended the sentence Advertisement Section 83 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 provides that A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction In the case of Mr Gandhi there is a conviction but no sentence that is effective or operating Therefore did he incur a disqualification on March 23 2023 It is a moot question Many have asked the question and are looking for an answer However the powers that be had no doubt whatsoever Within 24 hours whether they had asked the question or not and whether they had found the answer or not the Lok Sabha Secretariat disqualified Mr Gandhi Who can Disqualify Article 1022e of the Constitution of India provides that a person shall be disqualified for being a member if he is disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament Be it noted that the words used are not shall stand disqualified but shall be disqualified implying that an order of disqualification will be necessary The obvious question has been asked by among others Mr PDT Achary former secretary general of the Lok Sabha who has the authority to disqualify Article 103 may contain the answer it says if any question arises the question shall be referred for the decision of the President who shall obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and shall act according to such opinion In Mr Gandhis case the question was not referred to the President nor did the Election Commission offer any opinion So who took the decision Was it the Honble Speaker or a body known as the Lok Sabha Secretariat No one knows Advertisement Adapting Winston Churchill the case and its outcomes so far are riddles wrapped in a mystery,How do you get justice in India?,business

chars,The democratic process of any country demands transparency and decency These two poles determine the electoral faith of citizens But electoral democracy is just one part of democracy It ensures that demos or the people of the nation have representation in structuring and functioning of the State By having an election their say in making laws is ensured And the law determines the State However do elections ensure democracy or is it the majority Aristotle says the will of the majority is a bad idea because it can undermine the State Democracy in its pristine form concedes to the will wherein various factors decide the majority In the Indian context Dr B R Ambedkar argued that Indian metrics of power are decided with the majority and the minority wherein the majority is both a number and a cultural majority This takes the shape of communal majoritarianism which acts as a selfcontained group that is unable to think of the rest of society Thus there have to be special constitutional provisions to advance the interests of the minorities and protect them from the atrocities of the communal majorities That is how polity is separate from democracy since the latter by nature demands revolution At the other end of democracy is autocracy which if married with the principle of democracy has the ability to produce demagoguery The role of any processual democracy is to ensure good functioning of the State and in return have a civilized society serving the needs of the citizens Also read  Is democracy dying A postcard from a village in Odisha Citizens having rights and duties prescribed by the Constitution ensure their participation in the engine of the State Thus the philosophy of liberalism is often conflated with that of democracy In a coherent form of democratic governance absolutism and fear of autocratic tyranny are balanced by an engaged Opposition An enigmatic process in a democratic society the Opposition like the government is also voted by the people Therefore it is the voice of the public that is unrepresented in decisionmaking The moral cause of the Opposition is to arouse a sense of liberty and patriotism through difficult nationalism In his RPI manifesto Dr Ambedkar had envisaged the work of the Opposition to be vigilant exceeding the onceinfive years elections that do not guarantee real democracy Recently Opposition parties such as the Congress CPI CPIM AAP JDU Shiv Sena and NCP held a meeting in New Delhi to discuss the authenticity of processual democracy Their suspicion was directed towards the efficacy of electronic voting machines EVMs handling the worlds largest elections The Opposition often talks of technological interference via the Internet and programming of the machine as a tool for manipulation But it must be noted that the parties present at the meeting have ruled or are currently in power in states Doubts over EVMs were also raised by the BAMCEF Backward and Minority Community Employees Federation They even launched a nationwide agitation on the issue Advertisement The research community has demonstrated its defiance of EVMs A 2010 study by Prasad Halderman and Gonggrijp observed that EVMs are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot Computer scientists from Italy and the US found that the system was open to compromise Though one must take into account the efficiency of conducting elections via EVMs the possibility of corrupting a gadget is easily possible The Government of India has been accused of deploying Pegasus software to spy on its citizens Systems run by the Internet are prone to cyberattacks as was proved in the case of Irans nuclear facility at Natanz Cyberattacks involve theft of confidential data to manipulate programmes With the public still ignorant of technological advances the existence of esoteric knowledge on software manipulation makes EVMs an unfavourable option for many So how does one theorize the modern world in the womb of technology that is giving birth to new democracy The Opposition should start by demonstrating its seriousness over EVMs and not simply bemoan every election The complaint should be directed against the Election Commission and not towards a government or a party that is bound to change Advertisement Suraj Yengde author of Caste Matters curates Dalitality and is currently at Oxford University,"In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo reflects on the importance of electoral

photograph of Mara Flix is as legendary as the Mexican and French actress herself Taken in 1980 by British photographer Lord Snowdon the style icon is seen in a largebrim fedora with the band lined with jewels She is smoking a cigarillo with white plastic filter and ashes hanging off the end Her upturned left arm and hand reveals a group of gold and gemset bracelets and rings Her head is turned slightly sideways with the hat brim tilted to the right side which reveals one of two leaf ear clips by Cartier that she commissioned Around her neck is a necklace depicting two gold crocodiles by Cartier that she also commissioned The one crocodile is covered with 1023 brilliantcut fancy intense yellow diamonds and it sees the world through two navetteshaped emerald cabochons eyes The other is paved with 1060 emeralds and completed with two ruby cabochon eyes Entirely articulated the two crocodiles can be worn separately as brooches Both crocodiles are just under a foot in length The jewels she is wearing and her stature in the image show her to be a true reptile lover and reflects her fondness for imposing jewels as part of her style Mara Flix photographed by Ignacio Castillo wearing her Snake necklace commissioned from Cartier   Paris in 1968 Cartier Flix 19142002 is beloved in Mexico and France for films such as Emilio Fernandezs Enamorada 1946 Jean Renoirs French Cancan 1955 and Luis Buuels Fever rises in El Pao 1959 The Mexican diva and archetypal Latin femme fatale carried on her acting career until the late 1960s The crocodile necklace and another piece a large gempaved snake she commissioned Cartier to create are a significant part of the exhibition Cartier Design A Living Legacy at Museo Jumex in Mexico City which will run till May 14 The colorful snake made of platinum white gold and yellow gold is nearly twofoot long and is fully articulated Its covered with 2473 brilliant and baguettecut diamonds weighing a total of 17821 carats and is further highlighted with green red and black enamel It peers through eyes made of two pearshaped emeralds Pierre Rainero Cartier Image Style  Heritage director  JeanFrancois ROBERT Cartier Pierre Rainero whose career with Cartier spans 40 years with the last 20 as Image Style  Heritage director knew Flix when she lived in Paris She had an incredible sense of humor very witty and incredibly cultured Rainero said of her She could speak French fluently almost without an accent And she had a perfect knowledge of what society is She understood Parisian society perfectly She knew how to act and behave Her link with Cartier is from that period And its very interesting how she started to buy pieces from stock meaning already created by us panthers by the way Then she moved to special orders because she wanted panthers in her own style with different attitudes Then she commissioned special orders representing different animals and things You can see she understood that Cartier for her was a companion Platinum and diamond bangle Cartier Paris special order 1934 The client supplied almost all of   the stones Cartier You would be forgiven if you think the focus of the museum exhibition is on Flixs jewels based on the publicity surrounding the event or by reading this story up to now In actuality Flixs pieces though immensely impressive and expressive make up two of the 160 Cartier jewels watches and art objects in the exhibition They were culled from Cartiers inventory of more 3000 historic pieces dating from 1860 to the latter part of the 20th century Known as the Cartier Collection these objects of high design and craftsmanship have been shown at museum exhibitions around the world since 1989 Each exhibition has a different theme created by a guest curator who has access to the collection and the archives The Mexico City exhibition is the 39th such exhibition for the collection Among his responsibilities Rainero is in charge of the acquisition management archival information and the museum distribution of the Cartier Collection objects Ana Elena Mallet exhibition curator Cartier The exhibition is curated by Ana Elena Mallet a Mexico Citybased curator specializing in modern and contemporary design She had access to the jewels plus the archival information which as an art historian she was especially attracted to She created a retrospective of the history of Cartier design and style by dividing the exhibition into five sections The Early Days and the Birth of a Style Universal Curiosity Jeanne Toussaints Taste Wearing Beauty and Measuring Time and Mara Flix and Icons of Elegance Design for a tiara Cartier Paris circa 1906 Proposal for an execution in platinum and diamonds   Graphite and gouache on tracing paper Cartier I really wanted it to be a narrative that you could understand from the first stylesthat garland styleand how it evolved into Art Deco and then the 20s she said Then looking at other cultures and then learn how it changes in the 30s with more volume and different stones when Jeanne Toussaint comes into the picture It really helps to understand how this style developed People at the end could understand why Mara Flix would choose Cartier as her house of preference because they were daring and they were innovating in with different materials aesthetics and techniques At that time going to Cartier was like going to the doctor she added They would tell you what to wear and how to look Maria understood that Cartier could do that How Cartier can translate her style and her will Oiseau Libere brooch gold platinum rosecut diamonds one sapphire cabochon eye coral lapis   lazuli During World War II Cartier designed various pieces featuring caged birds symbolizing occupied France Once Paris was liberated jewels were designed with the patrioticallycolored bird bursting from its cage in an explosion of joy Cartier Mallet was especially excited to curate this exhibition because Cartier previously held an exhibition of its jewels in Mexico City in 1999 and she attended it in the beginning of her professional art career She left the exhibition impressed that jewels can be used in a museum context For me it was really important to understand that this material could also belong in a museum and multiple cultural lectures could be done with this amazing material that is jewelry she said Because of this it was very exciting for me to have the opportunity to work with the Cartier Collection Mallet had several challenges when it came to creating her vision for the exhibition The main one was to tie the exhibition to Mexico and Latin America which was no easy feat since the Cartier archives provided little in this area of expertise and inspiration Why have a Cartier exhibition in Mexico right now There should be Mexican links Mallet said I know Louis Cartier was looking to the orient and to China and India But what about Mexico and South America There was a jewel in the collection that looked like it could be of preColumbian inspiration an unusual platinum pyramid clip brooch commissioned in 1935 with baguette diamonds coming out of its sides and a round oldcut diamond of more than four carats in the center It appears to have been inspired by a Mayan or similar temple but there was no information to prove it It became the first piece in the exhibition Pyramid clip brooch Cartier Paris special order 1935 Platinum round oldcut diamonds one   weighing approximately 420 carats baguette and singlecut diamonds Two identical clip brooches were originally made to be worn separately or as a single piece the client later asked that one of the brooches be set on a bracelet of white gold and black lacquer Cartier We didnt find any proof in the archive but the pyramid was there The first piece in the exhibition That was a South America or Latin America pyramid This is proof they were looking here And of course the end of the show with Maria Felix theres a connection I thought we could tie the Mexican connection in the beginning and the end It is obviously very similar to Mayan pyramid added Rainero But our archives do not have the evidence that there was an image of a pyramid that led to this piece In many other cases we have the inspiration This design is so obvious it says a lot about the imagery of preColumbian architecture that was present in the minds of our people Design for a bracelet Cartier Paris 1934 Executed in platinum and diamonds Graphite and gouache   on tracing paper Cartier Another association with Latin America is the Santos watch It is believed to be the first wristwatch Louis Cartier created this watch in 1904 for Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto SantosDumont who complained that he had difficulty flying while using his pocket watch It was a simple solution to a serious problem that may have made the wristwatch fashionable The fourth section of the exhibition relating to Cartier timepieces includes an area dedicated to the aviator and the Santos watch For Mallet her favorite part of the exhibition was the third section dedicated to Jeanne Toussaint 18871976 one of the most important artistic and design influences of Cartier Louis Cartier named her the director of artistic design in 1933 an unheardof post for a woman at that time She was best known for panther jewels an iconic symbol of the jewelry house During her career she moved from Art Deco jewels to sculptural and threedimensional panther creations typically set with white and yellow diamonds emeralds and onyx Her first panther jewela gold and enamel panther brooch set with a cabochon emeraldwas crafted for the Duchess of Windsor Wallace Simpson in 1948 Her influence at Cartier lasted until she retired in 1970 For me it was really important because I didnt know anything about Jeanne Toussaint Mallet said Cartier having a creative director as early as 1933 And that she was a freespirited woman super independent with a mind of her own in in the 1930s was fantastic How Jeanne Toussaint started looking at the world and trying to bring Cartier into fashion and fashion into Cartier She was very good friends with Coco Chanel and with fashion editors at the time Mara Flixs Snake necklace Cartier Paris special order 1968 Cartier It was also unusual for any single person much less a women in the early 20th century to have such an influence over the artistic style at Cartier In 2017 Cyrille Vigneron Cartiers CEO explained to me that while Cartier has some styles that have become iconic such as Tutti Frutti jewels the Panther and floral patterns the luxury brand creates high jewels of all shapes styles and creativity because each piece is developed around the gems they purchase Basically each work starts with a stone and goes through all sorts of inspirations and openness to the world he said The results of this process are jewels of varying shapes styles and motifs that are still identifiable as Cartier based on the quality of the artistry and craftsmanship Whether its figurative or nonfigurative whether its geometric or some kind of art style or when its just a source of inspiration that is absolutely new he said All of them are Cartier in their way Inside the exhibition space created by architect Frida Escobedo Cartier Space plays an equally important role in the exhibition Mexican architect Frida Escobedo created a darkened environment with recessed vitrines brightened with spotlights allowing the bejeweled objects to standout in the darkness Its not the first such exhibition to use darkened space to focus on the jewels Wallace Chan used this technique in his Hong Kong exhibition and JARs 2013 exhibition space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was so dark that people were bumping into one another But this space at Meso Jumex is different in that it combines a spiritual experience and sense of discovery Not only discovering the jewels but its as if you are in a cave discovering the materials as well Im interested in this idea of a ruin but not the ruin in the sense of decay More like something that is in perpetual construction or in the process of being made Escobedo said I think quarries and some archaeological sites share that relationship Mexican architect Frida Escobedo Cartier To me the idea was of going deeper into the layers of history of the legacy of Cartier The idea of going underground to the origin And then you take these paths that takes you chronologically through all the pieces You can see the references and how they influence each other throughout the history of the house Theres also a frame of reference for each vitrine For example the first piece the pyramid brooch that looks like a Mayan temple is the first piece one encounters at the end of a long and darkened corridor Escobedo says she tried to create this effect throughout the exhibition It was important for us to plan together with Ana Mallet from the logical order of the pieces but also to always have a point of attention and tension so you can see a piece at the end of a corridor or something that was framed that would pull you into the next section Its almost like a teaser to the next section of the exhibition Museo Jumex Cartier The design is based on photos of the ancient Tenayuca pyramid just outside Mexico City taken in the 1930s by artist Josef Albers The walls of the space were made of darkened concrete panels quite large poured individually with textured vertical lines They are mounted on an angle Its a monumental work But also whats nice about it is that you can see the craftsmanship Escobedo said of the exhibition space You can see the nuances of each of the panels At the same time it is very subtle as a background Its rich but its not overpowering the pieces Its just creating a backdrop for them Cartiers pieces in the exhibition combines exceptional materials fine craftsmanship and historical importance However Mallet made a deliberate decision to include only the basic details of each piece in the exhibition Rainero agrees with this decision so those in the exhibition can focus on the forms of the pieces and how the changing style of Cartier through the years relates to how the luxury brand has evolved I think theres a consistency a coherence in the exhibition which is selfexplanatory he said And I think this exhibition is very interesting because like art in general but in many museums the curators want to give as much information about the artist or whatever And sometimes its at the price of the appreciation of each of the works This exhibition for me combines the two because of the way the windows are separated one from the other the number of pieces in each window and the type of lighting It allows the visitor to appreciate the beauty of each of the piece at the same time You understand the message and the thinking of the curator So I think theres a very good balance for the visitor when going through the exhibition,All

Swahili culture had a matriarchal nature when Persian men married into the culture about 1000 years ago The Swahili retailed this matriarchal feature during colonial rule and modern times Here we see two Swahili women in Zanzibar circa 1890 About a millennium ago long before the age of internet dating Swahili women in eastern Africa paired up with a new type of suitor men from Persia a new study finds Researchers made the finding by studying the ancient DNA of 80 aristocrats buried in six medieval and early modern towns along the Swahili coast they wrote in a new study published March 29 in the journal Nature opens in new tab These international hookups occurred just as Islam was spreading to the Swahili region the researchers noted The study supports historical evidence that Swahili aristocrats are descendants of Persians who married Africans centuries ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale coauthors Chapurukha Kusimba opens in new tab professor of anthropology at University of South Florida and David Reich opens in new tab professor of genetics and human evolutionary biology at Harvard University wrote in The Conversation opens in new tab Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them This tomb site along the Swahili Coast in East Africa is one of the places where scientists uncovered ancient DNA from the Swahili elite Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida The Swahili civilization has existed for thousands of years along the coast of East Africa where they played a key role in the trade routes connecting Africa Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China Swahili people embraced Islam a little more than 1000 years ago fell under colonialist control in the 1500s and did not regain their independence until the mid 20th century The Swahili people were then largely absorbed into modern Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar The question of where the Swahili came from originally and how their unique culture evolved has been subject to debate among academics for at least a century Not all of these debates were carried out in good faith Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Kusimba and Reich wrote Related Polynesians and Native Americans paired up 800 years ago DNA reveals The new study shows that the story of the Swahili is neither straightforward nor far off from the civilizations own legends Anthropologist Chapurukha Kusimba from the University of South Florida made it his life mission to research the Swahili culture After receiving approval from the people of Swahili Kusimba was able to excavate cemetery remains Image credit Chapurukha Kusimba University of South Florida Upon examining the DNA of the medieval Swahili elite some of whom lived up to 800 years ago the scientists discovered that the majority of male ancestors came from Asia  particularly Persia or modernday Iran  while the majority of female ancestors came from Africa These findings bring out the African contributions and indeed the Africanness of the Swahili without marginalizing the Persian and Indian connection Kusimba said in a statement opens in new tab Further the Persians do not appear to have forced their ideologies upon their African partners Oral traditions and archaeological evidence suggest that the descendants of these AsianAfrican unions spoke an African language and that African women retained significant economic and social power The researchers suspect that the traditional matriarchal society of the Swahili was by then so entrenched that even the traditionally patriarchal Persian men followed local custom so that they could marry into powerful African families The fact that their children passed

scandals in the franchise since debuting on 90 Day Fianc The Other Way Palm Springs resident Jenny was a mom to three grownup daughters with grandchildren when she flew to India to get married to Sumit in Delhi on TOW season 1 Jenny was giving up her entire life to be together with Sumit but little did she know the surprise that was waiting for her in India Now four years later Jenny is happily married to Sumit as viewers wonder if hell ever relocate to the USA 90 Day Fianc couple Jenny and Sumit knew each other for almost a decade when they got married in August 2021 Their wedding was the couples secret until Sumit could announce it to his parents They were last seen together in 90 Day Fianc Happily Ever After season 7 which documented how their age difference affected their compatibility as husband and wife However Jenny whos still in India is making things work with Sumit as fans watch Jenny and Sumit on new Pillow Talk episodes SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT 5 90 Day Fianc Couple Jenny  Sumits Age Gap Jenny and Sumit are celebrated as one of the franchises most real couples As a pair they also represent a common storyline that has been seen in the franchise to date The shows initial concept was to document brides coming from Eastern European countries such as Russia to the US It also started to focus on large age gaps between couples including shocking age differences between white women who had met foreign men online and wanted to get married to them The biggest 90 Day Fianc age gap until then between an American woman and her boyfriend might have been between Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi Michael and Angelas age differs by 22 years Before them it was Darcey Silva and Jesse Meester with an 18year age gap However Jenny is a whopping 29 years older than Sumit At present Jenny is 63 years old while Sumit is 34 years old The couple seems to have met a decade ago in 2012 This means when Jenny and Sumit met they were 53 and 24 years old respectively which by all means is a concerning age difference 4 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Catfished Jenny Of course Jenny might have not known Sumits real age when she first met him In fact Jenny didnt even know Sumit He was pretending to be a man called Michael Jones Sumit seemed to have made a fake profile with the name he used at his call center job in Delhi He used it for playing games on Facebook Sumit had pictures of S Club 7 singer Rachels husband Alex Bourne as his display profile When Jenny suspected that Sumits photos came from a magazine he even claimed that a colleague had clicked them Apart from Alex Sumit also used Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoors photos 3 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Was Already Married To Another Woman Its strange and funny how Jenny didnt realize he was pretending to be two different men posting pictures of two completely different celebrities Regardless Sumit continued to hide one more secret from Jenny even after he finally came clean to her and she found him cute Jenny had visited Sumits house in 2012 under the guise of being his friend Jenny even stayed with Sumits family for two months Apart from overstaying her welcome Jenny also welcomed Sumit into her room in the middle of the night She took Sumits virginity Sumit was caught redhanded by his father It seems once Jenny went back to America Sumit was married off to another woman Sumit stayed married to the woman for several years while he continued to date Jenny longdistance But once Sumit started to film 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 1 and started staying with Jenny in a different home than his parents and wife the wife became suspicious She had gone to Jennys door leaving the Palm Springs woman shellshocked while Sumits wife also got the police involved in the altercation that followed 2 90 Day Fianc Star Jenny Tried To Become Hare Krishna Devotee Once Sumit and his exwife divorced the coast became clear for Jenny to get married to him At least thats what Jenny thought because Sumits parents Sadhna and Anil never accepted her as Sumits wife With Sumit waiting for his parents to grant him permission to get married Jenny moved to India again While she waited for Sumit to agree Jennys tourist visa expired and the pandemic struck adding more restrictions on her flying in and out of the country In order to keep staying in India a lawyer suggested Jenny should consider giving up her American citizenship and the benefits that came with it The attorney suggested Jenny had only one technical option left He asked Jenny to apply for a missionary visa through ISKCON which stands for International Society for Krishna Consciousness Jenny laughed at the idea of becoming a Hare Krishna devotee considering shes not a religious person She was filmed visiting the temple and talking to the religious heads to know how she could continue staying in India But the missionary visa wasnt as much of a loophole as it was an obstacle in Jenny and Sumits relationship The last option was for Sumit to get over his cold feet and marry Jenny which he did although in secret 1 90 Day Fianc Star Sumits Mom Does Neti Yoga One of the most disturbing scenes in Sumit and Jennys 90 Day Fianc storyline involved Sumits mother Sadhna doing neti Sumits mother and father were visiting Jenny and his home during 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 3 They wanted to check how much of a daughterinlaw Jenny could be to them considering she was much older than Sumits mother herself Upon entering the house Sumits mother inspected the kitchen and squealed with disgust upon noticing how Sumit and Jenny were staying in unhygienic conditions But then Sadhna did something even more strange during her yoga practice Jenny whos lost weight recently is generally a fit woman for someone whos in her mid60s Yet Sumits parents wanted to test Jennys strength and flexibility They tried to get Jenny to perform various asanas and also neti yoga which involved them cleaning their noses with a thread After pouring mustard oil down their nostrils Sumits mom and dad had inserted a thick piece of thread through their noses and gagged until it emerged out of their throats so they could floss their nasal passages with it The 90 Day Fianc scene was unwatchable because nasal flossing had nothing to do with Jennys daughterinlaw skills Source Sumit

Are there mitigation strategies that show reasons for optimism We explored these questions and more at our BakeOffs and Show Floor Showdowns at our Data and Analytics Summit in Orlando with 4000 of our closest DA friends and family We did two BakeOffs this year The first featured analytics and BI platform Gartner Magic Quadrant leaders while the other showcased high interest data science and machine learning platforms The BakeOffs are fastpaced fun and informative sessions that let you see leading vendors sidebyside using scripted demos and a common data set in a controlled setting And this years BakeOffs did not disappoint To extend the BakeOff experience to a broader range of vendors including smaller innovators we also did a series of Show Floor Showdowns for analytics and BI data science and machine learning and for data management The Show Floor Showdowns were held on the Exhibit Hall show floor and were based on the same demo script and data set used in the BakeOffs Any vendor that Gartner has covered in any of its research and all vendors that had a booth in the Data and Analytics Summit Orlando Exhibition Hall could apply to participate in Show Floor Showdowns From there participants were randomly selected and invited to present live at the Show Floor Showdown sessions We also gave the demo script and data set to all vendors in the Exhibit Hall to create demos for their booths and to submit for this blog For the vendors that participate in the BakeOff and Show Floor Showdowns it is in equal measure fun and extremely stressful Its a high stakes session where they put everything on the line in front of their arch competitors revealing whats coming and coveted sales tactics all while being judged by attendees It takes a fair bit of preparation extreme commitment and an ability to shine under pressure What Data Did We Use We use the BakeOffs and the Show Floor Showdowns as a platform for data for good This years scenario was to understand the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and the resulting devastating human and economic impact because of unpredictable weather conditions Are there mitigation strategies that can be implemented successfully that could provide policy guidance and reasons for optimism in the face of ever increasing frequency of extreme weather events We gave the vendors data from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD data and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA from the National Centers for Environmental Information They could supplement this data with any other relevant data sets Last years topic was the UNs Sustainable Development Goals In 2021 we explored vaccine effectiveness and inequity using global vaccine data In 2020 we analyzed population health data In past BakeOffs we explored loneliness and happiness data opioid epidemic data traffic fatalities college costs and homelessness The results showing the impact of flooding predictions for the future and reasons for optimism were fascinating This blog highlights some notable findings and the videos from participating vendors BI BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Microsoft Here is the link to Microsofts BI BakeOff video Qlik Key Findings In the US alone theres 367 billion in agricultural commodities at risk to flooding in the US alone There have been 338 weather events that have created over a 1 billion dollars USD plus of damage totaling to 24 trillion in damages altogether and averaging 71 billion per event For most coastal countries climate change and flooding are critical topics of policy and development strategies A large part of underdeveloped Asian countries ranging from Bangladesh to Vietnam are at high risk of flooding events Here is the link to Qliks BI BakeOff video Salesforce Tableau Key Findings Unlike other European countries the Netherlands has the most square meters of land at risk of flooding as well as the greatest population at risk of flooding 70 While there are many factors that can contribute to flood risk such as changes in landuse from urbanization and deforestation there are also natural geographic features that can put certain populations at increased flood risk These factors include  of population at risk average elevation and  of inland waterways throughout a region A big factor as to why Netherlands faces extreme flooding risk is that 15 of the region is comprised of inland waterways As population density increases in major metropolitan areas predisposed to flooding risk to life and livelihood is expected to continue to increase In 2000 the Netherlands had 85 million people at risk of catastrophic flooding In 2040 that number is projected to grow to 102 million Here is the link to Tableaus BI BakeOff video Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff Vendors Key Findings and Videos Alteryx Key Findings The task was to analyze the likelihood of more frequent and anomalous flooding and provide mitigation strategies The objective was to identify highrisk areas the US Department of Interior should focus their resources for river flooding over the next 10 years Climate change may lead to more frequent and severe flooding Through the analysis we found regions with high risk of flooding including Big Horn County in Montana which has a high Native American population at higher risk of safety and economic impact Recommended mitigation strategies include improved infrastructure early warning systems landuse planning and community engagement focused on the middle Rockies surrounding areas Here is the link to Alteryxs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Dataiku Dataiku chose to focus on flood risk by geography and floodings economic impact on commercial insurance policies and claims With a business use case of defining a location and insurance strategy for a proposed warehouse in southeast Florida here are some of the key findings Extreme rainfall and rising sea levels are driving up both flood frequency and insurance costs especially in highrisk Florida areas Southern Floridas Atlantic coast has increased flood risk leading to more and costlier flood insurance claims in areas like Homestead and Miami compared to West Palm Beach and Port Saint Lucie Our analysis suggests prioritizing Hobe Sound or Stuart FL for real estate investment due to no past floods or claims within a 60minute driving radius reducing risks to warehouse contents and distribution routes Interpretation of our machine learning model suggests buying 50k in building coverage and 100k in warehouse content coverage as the latter significantly boosts predicted flood claim payouts Here is the link to Dataikus Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video SAS SAS took the view that mitigating and anticipating flooding events should be focused on the goal of helping people SAS created on top of the traditional statistical and machine learning models to predict events a set of four unique models specifically focused on helping people impacted by flooding An optimization network model cost network flow algorithm to optimally help displaced people reach public shelters and safer areas An optimization network model vehicle routing algorithm to optimize routes and the time it takes to transport displaced people to public shelters and safer areas An autocorrelation forecasting model to identify parameter estimators associated with relevant variables that impact the likelihood of flooding events Based on these estimators SAS created an easy to use whatif dashboard The user can change the variable values to understand how these changes would impact the likelihood of future flooding events A time series regression on referenced spatial data to estimate future flooding locations within hurricanescyclones paths The hope is governments could prepare for a flooding event and consider mitigating actions to help people in future danger Here is the link to SASs Data Science and Machine Learning BakeOff video Analytics and BI Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Course5 Intelligence Key insights from Course5 Intelligence include The US states with the highest susceptibility to coastal flooding for a 10year return period are Alaska Delaware Maryland and New Jersey Louisiana Arkansas Mississippi and West Virginia are the US states with the greatest vulnerability to river flooding for a 10year return period During river flooding Louisiana experiences more severe impacts on builtin lands and crops with exposure percentages of 5060 for builtin lands and 4045 for crops based on data from the OECD on river flooding Between the years 2000 and 2020 river flooding in Louisiana caused crop damages worth 270 million and property damages worth 91 billion Heavy rainfall along with storms is one of the primary causes of flooding in Louisiana as evidenced by the graph of flood frequencies vs annual precipitation  Some of the other general reasons for flooding in Louisiana are hurricanes poor drainage levee breaches and deforestation Also based on the historical data there is a very high chance of flooding in Louisiana in the year 2024 with a likelihood of 31 According to ChatGPTs suggestion some of the flood mitigation strategies that could be deployed by the government in Louisiana are improve the drainage system improve building standards improve land use practices and improve emergency response Here is the link to Course5s Show Floor Showdown video Datamatics Key Findings In China Impact of coastal flooding

Exposure is significant The Entire United States  Builtup Area Exposure is significant Here is the link to Datamatics Show Floor Showdown video Domo Key Findings YearoverYear YoY analysis has shown that based on data from the first quarter of 2023 the Northern Gulf Coast of Florida Leon County has a hotter average temperature than the previous 4 years Weather station analysis shows that Leon County Florida has received the most precipitation by 50 over other key flood zones in Florida although MiamiDade county has had the most flood events year to date Insights driven by regression analysis demonstrate that major storm events 100year 50year and 25year impact zones for built up areas and will continue to increase over the next 5 years as 10year impact zones stabilize thus identifying that major storm event activity will continue to grow in size and impact on the surrounding areas of typical flood events Although Leon and MiamiDade counties are seeing the largest impact respectively due to increased precipitation and flood events Lee County has the highest average damage in dollars per event due to hurricane activity Here is the link to Domos Show Floor Showdown video Incorta Here is the link to Incortas Show Floor Showdown video LTIMindtree Lumin picked up the South Asia Region for the river flooding analysis Some of their key insights include India has seen the highest population more than 40 million impacted by river flooding in the last five years This river flooding has been caused by severe land precipitation but has been exacerbated by growth in dry grassland cover and artificial surface cover at the cost of vegetative cover A quick simulation revealed that continued urbanization in India would lead to another 6500 square kilometers of land area being exposed to floods in a five year horizon A statewise deep dive uncovered the densely populated West Bengal and Bihar as the most affected regions with 17 million people exposed to floods in Bihar There is however a cause for optimism as the trend of flood mortality or the casualties from flooding events has decreased steadily Densely and moderately populated regions in India have seen a significant drop in flood mortality  This decrease in casualties is driven by drop in the number of flooding events and the number of days of flooding but the number of people displaced due to flooding in India continues to remain fairly high each year causing massive social and economic upheaval Here is the link to LTI Mindtrees Show Floor Showdown video SAP Analytics Cloud Key Findings River Flood has more impact on Population and Economics The only exception is in the Netherlands where Coastal Flood is a significant problem Population at Risk Cropland at Risk and Total Land at Risk all have a linear relationship with Population Cropland and Land in a country Due to this the largest and most populated countries suffer more typically found in Asia The most suffering countries are at the same time largest Agriculture producers with a high share of Agriculture in their GDS Therefore flooding is not only dangerous for people and infrastructure but also has a large economic effect especially affecting food supply through Agriculture Countries with a high GDP per capita are in the safest positions regarding flood while low GDP per capita countries are strongly affected by floods

Key Findings After analyzing global disasters across the past 30 years to understand the impact of floods vs other natural disasters we discovered that from 1990 to 1991 there were a lot of land and mud slides in eastern Asia that led to a 388 increase in total affected population due to floods caused by heavy rains Put simply indirect floodrelated disasters have proven devastating to human life

found that the most recent dollar claim value impact occurring in Ida Oklahoma Here is the link to Telliuss Show Floor Showdown video Data Science and Machine Learning Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos Aible Key Findings Predicting floods is not as actionable as focusing our resources on trying to address floods that affect at least 100 people Such a specific goal enabled a far more useful analysis We need to balance multiple KPI such as lives affected vs economic impact of the floods as well as stay within relevant budgets We need to consider fairness For example if we stayed within current budgets and only focused on the economic impact of floods we would underinvest in underdeveloped regions This would be contrary to the goals of a hypothetical UN agency By trying out different definitions of fairness we can balance our fairness goals against economic ones A manual process cannot possibly consider so many different constraints but an AIfirst businessoutcomedriven approach conducts such analysis in minutes Here is the link to Aibles Show Floor Showdown video eQ Technologic Key Findings Cropland exposure and Builtup area exposure related parameters play a major role is deciding the flood predictions As for USA maximum floods have occurred in Quarter2 The highest cause of floods remains heavy rains and torrential rains It is observed that Texas has maximum floods in the last 5 years and they have been successful in reducing the damage due to floods in last 3 years Arizona has also reduced the damage and fatalities caused due to floods in the last 3 years Across the world it is observed that cropland exposure to river floods have gone down over the years Similarly buildup area exposure to coastal floods has also gone down Here is the link to EQ Technologics Show Floor Showdown video Data Management Show Floor Showdown Vendors Key Findings and Videos These vendors provided findings related to managing the data in their platforms Cloudera Hybrid analytics and transaction functions can coexist on the same data management platformbut require different storage processing memory and channels management from each other This reinforces the demand for workload management and separate optimization techniques Orchestration is the key to data management across intercloud multicloud and hybrid onpremises systems Pervasive and persistent monitoring of use cases can result in automation of patternbased or repetitive tasks Patternbasis can also consist of gradual drift and shift of workload patterns and this can be built into a predictive efficiency model Metadata management goes beyond technical metadata and even combining that with business metadata when it infers or anticipates new users of recently introduced data assets Effectively the pull analytics data search can be converted into a push and verify model in which new data is pushed to existing use cases Cloudera comes from being built for the cloud era Here

duo SalimSulaiman have had a fabulous start to 2023 Their Merchant Records seems bullishly buoyant they have come up with a dedicated devotional music channel and this month are all set for the India premiere of their musical Disco Dancer that had found much appreciation in London last year In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol Salim Merchant 49 one half of the musical duo speak about the musical the challenges of recreating the eponymous Mithun Chakrabortystarrer 1982 blockbuster film for the stage and about launching a devotionalmusic channel that will feature all faiths Edited excerpts SalimSulaimans Disco Dancer stage musical in London Your new musical will be premiering in Mumbai this month but musicals arent a new zone for you We launched the musical Disco Dancer last year in London it did really well there and we are doing it in Mumbai from April 10 onwards at the NSCI Dome in Worli Our first musical was Beyond Bollywood which was 10 years ago It did exceptionally well in London Europe the UAE and at the Kingdom of Dreams Gurugram We then did Umrao Jaan in 2019 And again we did a very successful run of it in London in January 2020 Following this COVID stalled everything and we will be relaunching the Umrao Jaan musical very soon Thats our next project The 1980s movie Disco Dancer was a superhit why did you choose this for a musical how are you going about presenting it on stage Mithun das Mithun Chakraborty Disco Dancer was the most epic film In those days in the 80s it was one of the first few films to have crossed Rs 100 crore earnings back then We love the film and whenever we see it we are transported to that era I have seen it three times as a child I was a kid when it released and can never forget it because I used to watch Mithin das steps and was so much in awe of that music And Bappi das late Bappi Lahiris compositions were super hits I Am A Disco Dancer written by Anjaan sung by Vijay Benedict Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Parvati Khan Koi Yahan Nache Nache by Faruk Kaiser and sung by Bappi da and Usha Uthup Ae Oh Aa Zara Mudke written by Anjaan and sung by Kishore Kumar Yaad Aa Raha Hai Anjaans words and Bappi das voice Krishna Dharti Pe Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Nandu Bhende Goron Ki Na Kalon Ki two versions written by Anjaan and sung by Suresh Wadkar and Usha Mangeshkar So many hits in one single film single album It was a rare project when all songs did so well nationally  combined with Bappi das iconic music Mithun das dance and acting and Babbar Subhashs direction We wanted to bring that alive as a musical on stage To recreate a classic isnt easy especially so if you are using a different platform  a film to a stage musical How much of this was a challenge It is a huge challenge of course because obviously the film had a lot of layers about the mother the struggle of a poor boy growing up to become a mega star and then after his mothers demise he takes revenge there is a lot of subtext for this musical There are many good messages of belief determination love for your parents love for your art and of course there is a romantic love story in it also It was a huge challenge to recreate historic legendary songs of Bappi da and then bring it on to the stage We also had to compose two fresh original songs especially for this musical And since it is set in the 80s we relived the entire era with costumes dancing and dialogues It was quite the challenge Disco Dancer musical in London Tell us about the cast Are all the actors also singers Yes Arjun Talwar plays the role of Jimmy Tia Kar is the female lead She was an Indian Idol contestant from 2012 whom I have known closely because I was a judge for that season All the singing is live and music is partly recorded and partly live Of course there is amazing choreography directed by Rajiv Goswami He has done incredible work He directed Umrao Jaan Beyond Bollywood and this is his third with us Irfan Siddiqui is the lyricist and has written for a lot of the movies Im composing for including Fashion 2008 Iqbal 2005 Kurbaan 2009 He has also written the new song that we have composed for this particular show and also the dialogues Saregama India Ltd is producing it and Suniel Shetty who is a huge fan of Bappi da and Mithun da is presenting it Bappi da passed away last year Did he know about this musical What was the first reaction to this When I last spoke to Bappi da in 2019 about our intention of redoing the iconic film as a musical for the stage he was extremely happy It was my dream that Bappi da could come for the premier He gave us his blessings all throughout the making of the musical Its really unfortunate that we lost him last year Arjun Talwar as Jimmy in Disco Dancer stage musical in London You recently launched a devotional channel Tell us about that My label is doing very well so I am extremely happy with that We are releasing many new songs focussing on festivals and recently

springs is 37 degrees Celsius Photo Wikimedia Commons At the end of a long day of travel or just in need of a break the idea of lounging and splashing around in natural thermal water that has traversed the earths searing crust is in itself relaxing Almost all of them come with therapeutic attributes of varying degrees But it is safe to say that a session in one of them is beyond soothing That many of the best hot springs in the world are stunningly located is an added bonus Take your pick from these Vals Switzerland 7132 Therme hotels thermal baths in Vals Switzerland Photo 7132 Hotel Vals Switzerland has several hot springs and has the added advantage of spectacular scenery that inevitably showcases rolling meadows alpine flowers and snowcapped mountains Both Bad Ragaz and Rigi Kaltbad fit perfectly into this description But for a slightly offbeat experience Vals in Graubnden is ideal Located at the edge of a tiny village filled with pretty halftimbered houses and a brook of electric blue water flowing through 7132 Therme is an unusual destination The thermal springs here have been known since the Bronze Age around 2000 BC to 700 BC but it is only in the last three decades that it is has undergone a transformation What makes it special and an architectural wonder is that the series of sprawling baths have been crafted from the dense green mountain quartz giving the whole area a jewelled look Theres natural thermal water in both indoor and outdoor pools at 7132 Therme Vals in Graubnden Photo 7132 Hotel Vals The natural thermal water is spread over several different kinds of pools both indoor and outdoor whose temperature ranges from 30 degrees Celsius to 36 degrees Celsius It is especially relaxing and fun to float around on the outdoor pool with beautiful views of the surrounding mountains some of which have snow on the peaks even in summer The changing scenery is also something that captivates through the summer  lush green slopes with colourful flowers turn to beautiful golden yellow and orange in autumn and then wear a cloak of white during winter once the snow begins to fall Apart from the various pools there are several kinds of baths including steam baths In addition there are also several treatments like Swedish massages restorative and detoxifying rituals and other treatments Pamukkale Turkey In Turkeys Pamukkale National Park a Unesco World Heritage site hot springs bubble in 17 tiered limestoneterrace pools Photo Wikimedia Commons In Turkeys Pamukkale National Park a Unesco World Heritage site hot springs bubble from brilliant blue waters against bright white limestone terraces forming 17tiered pools As much as it is beautiful to look at getting into them is even better Predictably the alluring waters have drawn the whos who of world history Legend has it that it even hosted Cleopatra at one point and the pool was gifted by Marc Antony So it is named after her The water is around a balmy 3436 degrees Celsius and draws visitors with stories of its healing and therapeutic powers If nothing else go to the pools for their tranquility and relaxing powers If you have time to spare head to the ancient spa town

pavements and in public parks but head to the verdant Kerosene Creek hot springs in Rotorua New Zealand for a free dip Photo Google Located in the central part of North Island Rotorua is an astonishing town Not only are there a profusion of hot springs but also a plethora of geysers Whats strange is that they occasionally also erupt in peoples backyards from pavements and in public parks But the place to go for a dip is in Kerosene Creek a creek heated by a natural subterranean spring to a comfortably 30 degees Celsius Adding value is the surrounding New Zealands verdant jungles and waterfalls Whats more Kerosene Creek is absolutely free Takaragawa Japan Tucked in a forest the Takaragawa Onsens hot springs with a view of snowcapped mountains Photo Wikimedia Commons Tucked away in a forest the Takaragawa Onsens hot springs are both relaxing and dramatic with stunning views of snowcapped tips of mountains inside the twin parks of Joshinetsu Kogen and Oze National Parks There are four openair baths located next to the Takara River and the two seem to be in harmony with each other as well as nature An added bonus is that the forest surroundings change colour with the seasons so repeated visits are never the same For those who want extended stays theres even a hotel on site whose restaurant dishes up food from ingredients sourced from the mountains around Together visitors are made to feel they have arrived in paradise Blue Lagoon Iceland The water in Icelands Blue Lagoon hot springs surrounded by black lava rock takes its colour from the rich silica present in it Photo Wikimedia Commons It is difficult to think of hot springs in Iceland All the more reason why Blue Lagoon is truly out of this world Surrounded by block lava rock the milky blue waters bubble with billowing clouds of steam making it truly a spectacle The water takes its colour from the rich silica present in it which gathers as white sediment at the bottom of the pools and bathers are known to rub their skin over these for its supposed therapeutic value But just soaking in the 37 degrees Celsius waters is therapy enough Yumthang India The sulphurrich water might have a distinct sharp smell but the waters in Sikkims Yumthang Valley hot springs are known to relax and rejuvenate the body Closer home there is no dearth of hot springs but while some are difficult to access like Kheer Ganga others are crowded Yumthang in north Sikkim in the eponymous valley is ideal It is accessible and at an elevation of 3564 m 11693 ft above sea level it is hardly crowded The sulphurrich water has a

representen una imagen de una morada secreta protegida de la vista nada podra estar ms lejos de la verdad Porque esta es una casa que no trata de mimetizarse quiere sobresalir del resto llamar la atencin y captar esas miradas de la calle declaran los arquitectos Aslam Karadan y Sham Salim del estudio homnimo AslamSham Architects con sede en Kozhikode Es absolutamente nico con su forma y tiene la intencin de capturar la intriga de los transentes tal como el cliente quera La parte oculta del apodo explican proviene de la escala disfrazada de la casa una casa de tres niveles que crea la ilusin de ser una estructura ms pequea de dos pisos Clientes  Ajmal y Sabna una pareja joven de unos 30 aos Ajmal es un emprendedor que se hizo a s mismo y es cofundador de Eduwizz una startup de tecnologa educativa repartida por todo Kerala Sabna tambin es parte de la misma compaa Aunque los principales clientes son Ajmal Sabna y sus dos nias los padres de Ajmal y sus dos hermanos menores tambin son ocupantes de la casa El resumen funcional era bastante estndar y sencillo es decir queran una casa de 5 BHK con una habitacin adicional para usar como cine en casa piscina y otras comodidades estndar Sin embargo el resumen esttico es algo que a nosotros como arquitectos nos encant y encontramos desafiante al mismo tiempo El cliente como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario exitoso hecho a s mismo y quera construir una casa que hiciera una declaracin desde el primer vistazo pero que al mismo tiempo no comprometiera demasiado las funcionalidades Nos dieron la tarea de idear algo que estuviera fuera de la caja pero que no fuera completamente experimental Este resumen combinado con la naturaleza altamente contorneada del sitio que se inclinaba hacia abajo abruptamente desde el frente del sitio hacia la parte trasera es lo que condujo a la formafachada bastante nica del edificio y su nombre la Casa Oculta La escala de la casa permanece en gran medida oculta para un espectador desde la calle pero al mismo tiempo se destaca con su forma atpica y crea esa curiosidad en sus mentes por saber qu hay detrs de esa formafachada frontal peculiar En cuanto a la configuracin espacial la zonificacin bsica se ha realizado en funcin de la proximidad con la va que bordea el frente del solar La primera zona es la zona pblica que tiene visibilidad desde la calle y alberga el asiento delantero as como el espacio de vida formal que est destinado principalmente a los visitantesinvitados Luego viene la siguiente zona que es la zona semipblica que es el centro de actividad central y lo que nos gustara llamar como el alma de la casa que tiene el estanque Koi iluminado alrededor del cual se planifican todos los espacios de actividad central de la casa a saber la sala de estar familiar el comedor y la cocina Y luego viene la zona privada que alberga las habitaciones el cine en casa y la piscina que se coloca en la parte trasera del sitio y por lo tanto est completamente aislada de los extraos Adems con respecto a la configuracin espacial debe comprender que esto no se hace en un sitio plano este es un sitio muy contorneado por lo que tambin podramos lograr esta diferenciacin de zonificacin con los niveles Sin embargo desde el dormitorio principal se abre un balcn hacia el frente de la casa que era un requisito del cliente que necesitaba ver desde la entrada principal al sitio desde el dormitorio principal La parcela en forma de L tiene una parte que sobresale hacia el exterior en la parte trasera esta parte es la que se utiliza para acomodar el garaje El camino de entrada y las reas del garaje cuentan con paisajismo mientras que se proporciona ms paisajismo verde en el patio delantero La parte ms desafiante as como la ms emocionante de este proyecto fue definitivamente el proceso de manipular este sitio altamente contorneado para tener una casa con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intentaba reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da normal Esto se ha logrado dividiendo diferentes zonas en mltiples niveles La entrada principal a la casa est en la zona pblica que est a un nivel de solo un par de pasos desde el nivel del suelo que se aproxima en el frente el que est entre las paredes de granito macizo en el frente que juega con el sentido de escala a un visitante Este nivel tiene la sala de estar formal as como la sala de oracin nombres las cuales estn destinadas principalmente a los visitantes La entrada secundaria la entrada lateral en arco es la ms destinada a la familia ya que accede al ncleo de actividad principal de la casa con un solo paso Solo necesita bajar un paso desde ese nivel para llegar a la zona semipblica que alberga el estanque Koi el espacio de vida familiar el comedor y la cocina Es desde este nivel que se accede a los bloques de dormitorios mltiples que se distribuyen en tres niveles Entonces desde el nivel del rea comn es solo medio piso de ascenso y descenso a los 2 niveles que tienen 2 dormitorios cada uno El dormitorio principal y el cine en casa se encuentran en el nivel ms alto con un espacio de estudio y una terraza de servicio en un nivel medio entre estos dos niveles Por lo tanto la casa en total se divide en 67 niveles para adaptarse a todos los requisitos espaciales de los clientes sin alterar demasiado los niveles del sitio existente Tambin hay acceso terciario a la casa desde el nivel ms bajo que es el mismo que el nivel de la piscina el camino de acceso de la se extiende hacia la parte trasera del sitio y hay un porche desde el que se puede acceder a la casa y hay dos dormitorios tambin a este nivel Se puede acceder a este nivel a travs de una rampa y los 2 dormitorios aqu con acceso para automviles aseguran que la casa sea fcilmente accesible para las personas mayores y las personas con capacidades diferentes El ascensor se ha construido en la casa y por lo tanto siempre existe la posibilidad de agregar un ascensor ms adelante para acceder a todos los niveles cmodamente La paleta de materiales y colores se ha decidido principalmente para dar a la casa un carcter muy simple pero sofisticado Aparte de los blancos las texturas naturales de la mampostera de escombros al azar la madera los pisos de piedra natural con acabado de mltiples texturas como el granito las piedras de Kota la madera de la plataforma etc se eligieron para dar carcter a cada espacio y diferenciarlos visualmente sin comprometer la sensacin abierta de el espacio Los acentos verdes en toda la casa con macetas tambin ayudan a crear una sensacin clida y acogedora para el usuario Nos gusta exponer el verdadero carcter de los materiales en lugar de imitarlos en otra cosa y por lo tanto las losas de techo de hormign y los muros de contencin tienen texturas de hormign sin embargo es un acabado de hormign ms pulido para los interiores mientras que es un tono ms spero para el exterior La estrategia de iluminacin es algo fundamental para todos nuestros diseos diseamos para la mxima iluminacin natural durante todo el da lo que creemos que crea un bienestar mental para el usuario de manera subconsciente Idealmente queremos que las luces artificiales se usen solo una vez que se pone el sol Las duras luces del este y el oeste estn bloqueadas para que no caigan directamente en la casa y se toman de manera difusa a travs de pantallas con persianas fuera de las ventanas Por la noche se proporciona una iluminacin ambiental sutil en los interiores que brindan una comodidad ptima al usuario Sin embargo a los exteriores se les da una iluminacin un poco ms dramtica para que la estructura se destaque para un espectador desde la calle que era algo que el cliente deseaba Para ser honesto no podramos haber encontrado un cliente ms complaciente que estos dos ya que quedaron completamente cautivados por el concepto se los presentamos y apenas les pedimos cambios salvo los ajustes menores en el interior Este proyecto es uno de los ejemplos perfectos de cunto se puede elevar el producto final cuando los arquitectos y los clientes estn sincronizados Entonces fue ms como un sueo que todos vimos juntos Sera extremadamente difcil elegir un lugar como el favorito pero si tuviramos que elegir uno sera el ncleo de actividad principal de la casa que alberga todos los espacios comunes alrededor del estanque Koi iluminado por el cielo La terraza al aire libre desde el comedor que da al rea de la piscina es otro de los favoritos El cliente que como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario y pasa la mayor parte del tiempo en su propia casa ya que su trabajo se realiza en lnea nos dice que le encanta pasar tiempo en esta casa y que sigue encontrando nuevos lugares y siente cada espacio con cada pasar el da en la medida en que odia cuando tiene que irse para reuniones relacionadas con el trabajo de vez en cuando La mayora de los muebles se personalizan segn el espacio y el tema de diseo de la casa salvo algunos muebles sueltos y otros con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intenta reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da normal,  800-361-3020

testing with the AASM 1000 guided bomb Photo DGA The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now  5309 chars,The new standard brings major capability upgrades which pave the way for collaborative air combat The French Directorate General of Armaments DGA announced that the new Rafale F41 standard has been qualified and is now ready for fielding While the announcement was released just few days ago the qualification arrived on March 13 2023 shortly after the first aircraft in the new configuration was delivered to the Base Arienne 118 at MontdeMarsan The first plane we received is one of the F3Rs that we sent to the Flight Test Center of the Directorate General of Armaments in Istres for their software transformation explains Lieutenant Colonel Guillaume second in command of the Fighter and Experimentation Squadron ECE Other brand new aircraft will come directly from the Dassault production lines and will complete the fleet of fighters sent gradually to Istres for their transition from the F3R standard to the F41 The first Rafale F41 has been assigned to the Centre dExpertise Arienne Militaire Military Air Expertise Center followed by a second aircraft a week later where it immediately started operational testing the day after the delivery As mentioned by Lt Col Guillaume the DGA confirmed all the Rafales of the Air and Space Force and the French Navy will be gradually retrofitted to this new standard Dassault also resumed the deliveries of new Rafales to French military after a fouryear interruption The development of the Rafale F4 standard started in early 2019 when the contract for the new upgrade was notified by the Ministry of Defense soon after the certification of the F3R standard This standard is based on four pillars connectivity engagement availability and the detection and fight against threats said the Minister of the Armed Forces in that occasion This F4 standard is a technological leap an industrial leap a strategic leap According to the DGA improving the connectivity of the Rafale and the associated networked employment methods both in a national and allied context is the primary goal of the F4 standard The new standard will be the first step towards the networked multiplatform capabilities of the future Systme de Combat Arien Futur SCAF The F4 standard will include upgrades of existing capabilities like the Thales RBE2 Active Electronically Scanned Array AESA radar the Spectra Systme de Protection et dvitement des Conduites de Tir du Rafale or in English SelfProtection Equipment Countering Threats to Rafale Aircraft electronic warfare system the OSF Optronique secteur frontal frontal sector optronics the InfraRed Search and Track IRST the Thales Talios targeting pod the Reco NG reconnaissance pod and the communications suite However there will also be important new capabilities like the Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display HMD the MICA NG NextGeneration airtoair missile and the new 1000 kg variant of the Safran AASM Armement AirSol Modulaire Hammer PrecisionGuided Munition PGM Many of the new capabilities have been extensively tested during a test campaign in 2021 where two Rafale 41 were included in largescale realistic scenarios where the crews also implemented unspecified collaborative combat functionalities to localize adversaries by passive means The HMD is a longwaited capability for the Rafale Initially the Sagem Gerfaut HMD was chosen in the early 2000s to equip the Rafale however the program was later dropped According to reports Qatar and India asked for an HMD on their aircraft so the Elbit Targo II was integrated on the Rafale France however chose to integrate the Scorpion with a first test campaign carried out in Cazaux during March 2021 preceded by parachute compatibility tests to verify that the new helmet is safe for the pilot in the event of an ejection As for the 1000 kg AASM the new variant sees the AASM kit applied on the BLU109 penetrator warhead or the standard Mk84 but also to new developments in progress from the French company ARESIA BA84 and P1000 bomb bodies according to the missions needs The first separation tests were performed in December 2020 at the DGA Flight test center in Cazaux The new AASM variant has have also a specific range increase kit to extend its standoff firing range and was certified at the end of 2022 The Rafale will be able to carry up to three of these bombs of which one under the fuselage and two under the wings similarly to the already certified GBU24 Paveway III The Talios targeting pod has also been upgraded as announced by the DGA in November 2022 with the delivery of the 31st pod which is the first of the upgraded variant Among the new capabilities the pod has a highdefinition mode which integrates a near infrared imager and a color widefield sensor expected to be fully exploited by the Rafale 42 standard and an integrated datalink Among the other modifications the DGA mentioned the evolution of passive threat detection algorithms increased data exchange capacities between Rafales greater protection against cyber threats and improvements in fire control for the use of the Meteor missile with the missile managed by an aircraft other than the firing aircraft The Meteor missile was introduced with the F3R standard and became operational in 2021 intended to be used in conjunction with the MICA EM for long range engagements,The French defence ministry has announced that the new standard for the Rafale fighter jet has been qualified.,business

author of On Nixons Madness An Emotional History March 2023 Richard Nixon discusses Vietnam with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and Deputy National Security Advisor Al Haig at Camp David 1972 When H R Bob Haldeman first described Richard Nixons madman theory in his 1978 memoir The Ends of Power few scholars paid serious attention For those who did notice the oneparagraph description of Nixons riskladen strategy sounded like Haldeman was taking a cheap shot calling his old boss crazy After all Nixon had seen his chief of staff resign and serve time for the Watergate coverup The madman theory Haldeman wrote was a phrasewhich Im sure will bring smiles of delight to Nixonhaters everywhere Nearly half a century later scholars have established that the rash ruse was central to Nixons strategy to fight the Cold War The madman theory can also tell us a good deal about the famously elusive expresident himself how Nixon saw his career as he saw the superpower struggle how life for Nixon proved to be laden with exhilarating risk peril and a series of tests of will against determined foes According to Haldeman Nixon promised that he could end the Vietnam War by intimidating the North Vietnamese with seemingly reckless abandon I want the North Vietnamese to believe Ive reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war Nixon reportedly told his top aide He would play a kind of latterday ogre in the presidents words obsessed angry not able to be restrained As his national security advisor Henry Kissinger remarked Nixons strategy resembled a poker game in which he pushed so many chips into the pot that the United States foes would think the president had gone crazy Nixon liked to concoct names for such gambits He called this one the madman theory Yet the ploy pivoted on the idea that he did not consider himself to be mad He considered himself crafty It was not that he was suicidal but that he would act as if he were willing to risk joint nuclear annihilation The trick of the madman theory was how difficult it was for observers to decipher whether he would act on his threats for allout war or if he were simply pretending The more elusive the distinction the more effective the bluff The better the actor the crazier he seemed and if not firstrate Nixon was a perpetual performer Throughout his career he transformed from Redbaiter to Average Joe to worldly diplomat to crafty pol to elder statesman Haldeman called Nixon the Man of Many Facets The part of the bullying ogre was another role to play In the fall of 1969 Nixon enacted the madman theory threatening the North Vietnamese with abandon B52s loaded with nuclear weapons circling the Arctic aircraft carriers deployed to the Pacific a feint that pantomimed laying mines at the major North Vietnamese port of Haiphong Nixon believed he could scare Hanoi into peace he couldnt and he didnt The communists refused to back down and the war ground on and on Nixons faith in the madman theory did not however abate The historians William Burr and Jeffrey P Kimball the most notable scholars of the madman theory have written of how Nixon continued to adopt the strategy threatening nuclear intervention during a civil war in Jordan a crisis between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a bloody struggle between India and Pakistan Although it didnt fool the North Vietnamese the madman theory did work to a degree in Moscow As the Soviet Foreign Minister worried Nixon put forces on alert so often that it is hard to know what it meant Rather than a steady march toward dtente Nixon approached the Cold War as a series of emergencies demanding offthecuff often rash decisionmaking He looked at the superpower standoff and its proxy wars as a set of conflicts lurching from one crisis to the next from Latin America to Europe from the Middle East to South Asia to the Pacific Whether elated or aggravated Nixon returned spiritedly to the coercive ruse of the madman theory which reflected not only his predilection for acting and for secrecy but also his penchant for taking great gambles in pursuit of evergreater gains Nixon likewise envisioned himself as ever in the spotlight He saw his life as ever a fight to fend off fierce rivals as ever on the verge of great victory or collapse as ever a series of tests demanding great political gambles and allout assaults The madman theory tested his striving and determination and his skills as a performer It was another version of the story he told of himself of the lonely bootstrapped Dick Nixon risking everything as he reeled from crisis to crisis struggling gambling breakneck against a dangerous and threatening world And With no political experience not even owning a suit with only 10000 in the bank his wife Pat pregnant Nixon had taken a longshot chance at running for Congress in 1946 Four years later he ran for Senate with terrible odds against the muchbeloved Democrat incumbent and onetime move star Helen GahaganDouglas He continued to risk take risks in his political career in order to climb quickly precociously running for the vice presidency under Dwight Eisenhower at age 39 Two years after his defeat to John Kennedy for the 1960 presidency a 49yearold Nixon described his life not only as a set of gambles but as a pattern of excruciating public tests against powerful enemies looking to destroy him He titled his first biography Six Crises to describe his professional ascent He wrote of standing up valiantly to communists in the State Department during the House UnAmerican Activities Committee hearings He wrote of how he had been publicly castigated by Democrats for keeping a secret campaign fund that he maintained only defrayed costs for constituent mail and secretaries He recounted how his limousine had been attacked by leftist rioters on a diplomatic trip to Caracas Venezuela He described his showdown with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on an American kitchen display in the heart of Moscow Nixon wrote consistently of exhilaration and fright in the face of these public standoffs It was a circular telling He was ever acting the actor taking on the role of the performer prosecutor debater ambassador As he railed I have contempt for men who wont take chances I call them gutless wonders He maligned the press the counterculture antiwar protestors the naysayers those on the sidelines who played it safe They were not doers they were the feeble critics sickly Action and risk for Nixon were to be cherished As for the man in the arena willing to take chances he quoted Theodore Roosevelt If he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat The fundamental aspect of the madman theory Nixon told Haldeman was that he alone could play the part The communists Nixon insisted would believe any threat of force that Nixon makes because its Nixon Indeed the madman theory seemed a caricature of the famously frustrated politician It was he who baited the Reds furiously It was he who would not be kicked around anymore He who would not be contained He who could transform from new Nixon to new Nixon He insisted to Haldeman that the foremost reason that the madman strategy would work was his mad guise It was his reputation and his ability to act The strategic theory the crazed bluffery like a glove fit the man temper and control risk and performance The nuclear ruse would work Nixon proposed because its Nixon,Richard Nixon

siren for lifethreatening storms in Americas heartland a new computer model that combines artificial intelligence AI and NASA satellite data could sound the alarm for dangerous space weather The model uses AI to analyze spacecraft measurements of the solar wind an unrelenting stream of material from the Sun and predict where an impending solar storm will strike anywhere on Earth with 30 minutes of advance warning This could provide just enough time to prepare for these storms and prevent severe impacts on power grids and other critical infrastructure The Sun constantly sheds solar material into space  both in a steady flow known as the solar wind and in shorter more energetic bursts from solar eruptions When this solar material strikes Earths magnetic environment its magnetosphere it sometimes creates socalled geomagnetic storms The impacts of these magnetic storms can range from mild to extreme but in a world increasingly dependent on technology their effects are growing ever more disruptive For example a destructive solar storm in 1989 caused electrical blackouts across Quebec for 12 hours plunging millions of Canadians into the dark and closing schools and businesses The most intense solar storm on record the Carrington Event in 1859 sparked fires at telegraph stations and prevented messages from being sent If the Carrington Event happened today it would have even more severe impacts such as widespread electrical disruptions persistent blackouts and interruptions to global communications Such technological chaos could cripple economies and endanger the safety and livelihoods of people worldwide In addition the risk of geomagnetic storms and devastating effects on our society is presently increasing as we approach the next solar maximum  a peak in the Suns 11year activity cycle  which is expected to arrive sometime in 2025 To help prepare an international team of researchers at the Frontier Development Lab  a publicprivate partnership that includes NASA the US Geological Survey and the US Department of Energy  have been using artificial intelligence AI to look for connections between the solar wind and geomagnetic disruptions or perturbations that cause havoc on our technology The researchers applied an AI method called deep learning which trains computers to recognize patterns based on previous examples They used this type of AI to identify relationships between solar wind measurements from heliophysics missions including ACE Wind IMP8 and Geotail and geomagnetic perturbations observed at ground stations across the planet From this they developed a computer model called DAGGER formally Deep Learning Geomagnetic Perturbation that can quickly and accurately predict geomagnetic disturbances worldwide 30 minutes before they occur According to the team the model can produce predictions in less than a second and the predictions update every minute The DAGGER team tested the model against two geomagnetic storms that happened in August 2011 and March 2015 In each case DAGGER was able to quickly and accurately forecast the storms impacts around the world Previous prediction models have used AI to produce local geomagnetic forecasts for specific locations on Earth Other models that didnt use AI have provided global predictions that werent very timely DAGGER is the first one to combine the swift analysis of AI with real measurements from space and across Earth to generate frequently updated predictions that are both prompt and precise for sites worldwide With this AI it is now possible to make rapid and accurate global predictions and inform decisions in the event of a solar storm thereby minimizing  or even preventing  devastation to modern society said Vishal Upendran of the InterUniversity Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics in India who is the lead author of a paper about the DAGGER model published in the journal Space Weather The computer code in the DAGGER model is open source and according to Upendran it could be adopted with help by power grid operators satellite controllers telecommunications companies and others to apply the predictions for their specific needs Such warnings could give them time to take action to protect their assets and infrastructure from an impending solar storm such as temporarily taking sensitive systems offline or moving satellites to different orbits to minimize damage With models like DAGGER there could one day be solar storm sirens that sound an alarm in power stations and satellite control centers around the world just as tornado sirens wail in advance of threatening terrestrial weather in towns and cities across America Related Links Space Weather at NASA Solar Science News at SpaceDaily,.,business
