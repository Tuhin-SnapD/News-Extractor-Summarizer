Bull,Since the triumphs of his playing career the Asheswinning captain has struggled to find a meaningful niche in cricketI keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk ,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot o 5980 chars,I keep a photograph by my desk of Englands victory lap of the Oval after the last day of the 2005 Ashes The friend who took it was drunk so the outfield lists like the deck of a ship It was shot on one of those disposable plastic cameras but you can still pick out the players making their way around the boundary Theres Andrew Flintoff one arm above his head Marcus Trescothick holding the little crystal replica of the urn Steve Harmison one hand throttling a bottle of champagne and Michael Vaughan dapper despite his tired whites He has an England flag knotted around his neck It hangs down his back like a cape It was taken at about a quartertoseven in the evening on 12 September half an hour or so after the umpires had called off play on the final day of one of the greatest Test series when England had beaten one of the best teams to play the game to win back the Ashes after 16 years They say cricket doesnt build character but reveals it But you wonder how many of the millions who watched that series really had anything like a clear idea of the personalities of the men playing in it Fans are romantics after all and make heroes of their favourite players In the years afterwards we would get to know a little more about them all Trescothick and Flintoff who had seemed to be such easy and convivial people opened up about their struggles with mental illness We had Vaughan all wrong too There were no great revelations rather a gradual unfolding of himself in his television and radio work and on social media Still over time the gap between the Vaughan we saw in 2005 and the one we have come to know in the years since came to seem an awful lot wider than the 100odd yards between the grandstand seats and the pitch where we watched him go about his batting For an 18month stretch in the early 2000s he did that as well in Test cricket as any Englishman ever has 100 197 195 against India at home 177 145 183 against Australia away and altogether more runs than anyone but Viv Richards had ever made in a single year All in matinee idol style with a high elbow a handsome drive and a withering pull The captaincy took the edge off his form but England gained something better anyway As a young man at Yorkshire Vaughan studied the senior players around him Martyn Moxon David Byas Darren Lehmann

Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply after newsletter promotion As Englands captain he seemed again to combine the best qualities from people who had done it before him From this side of the boundary he appeared to have a fertile mind a feel for people a keen sense of when and whether to take risks a bullish selfconfidence and when he needed it a steady bat If you could have frozen his life in that moment in the late summer of 2005 he would be remembered now only as one of Englands very best captains His winning percentage a lick under 51 is second only to Mike Brearleys among people who did the job often Perhaps Vaughans great strength was that he was such a good blusterer he managed to convince what was in reality an utterly outmatched England team that they were capable of beating an Australia side including in Shane Warne Glenn McGrath Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist a good handful of the truly great players Michael Vaughan waves to the crowd after beating Australia in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge in 2005 Photograph Gareth CopleyPA There were signs of what was behind the bluff during his retirement years which were oddly needy There was a tearful press conference when he stepped down as captain and an awkward 11month stretch when he insisted he still wanted to play on that ended in a row with Yorkshires former chief executive in a car park outside Headingley after the club refused to indulge him in a farewell run of games for their oneday team It was followed by a string of embarrassing commercial deals including a stretch when he was busy flogging artworks he had made by flinging cricket balls at a canvas It felt as if Vaughans ego had convinced him that having achieved as much as he did in the sport his life after it owed him more than he had received He inevitably drifted into punditry where he could be brilliantly insightful when he was talking about the sport and an awful bore when he wasnt Other England captains from his era shaped second careers as writers analysts and administrators Vaughan apparently lost for anything better to do tried to make his way as a media personality He seemed to think the trick of it was in being witty which he isnt and offering provocative takes on hot topics He is you guess one of the few people left using the word banter without irony His most egregious tweets came up all over again during these Cricket Discipline Commission hearings which cleared him on Friday of using racist andor discriminatory language and bringing the game into disrepute Vaughan now says the words were disgusting and awful and other words you could use It wasnt clear if he was thinking of the one that feels most appropriate for them stupid Vaughans act wore thin long before he finally seemed to realise that the only reaction it provoked in most cricket fans was to make them pine for that time back in 2005 But even here theres a sense that our idea of him isnt quite right that hes still playing games Hes just not as good at them as he used to be at the one that made him famous to begin with Ask his friends and he has plenty in and out of the game and they will tell you about a thoughtful talented and affectionate man full of bright ideas You can only hope he decides to show it to the rest of us,entertainment,In our series of letters from British cricket writers we look back at some of the best photographs from the 2005 Ashes.

former presidents orbit Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan has sentenced Trumps close confident Allen Weisselberg to prison presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and overseen former adviser Steve Bannons criminal fraud case But Trumps historic arraignment on Tuesday will perhaps be Merchans most highprofile case to date even after a long career atop the statelevel trial court Merchan has been described by observers as a tough judge yet one who is fair no matter who is before him Heres what you need to know A MAN OF HIS WORD Trumps arraignment is likely to be a spectacle with a show of law enforcement and with the former president already fanning the flames on social media with his views on Merchan and his indictment But in the courthouse Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays attorneys who have appeared before him told CNN and hes known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention Judge Merchan was efficient practical and listened carefully to what I had to say Nicholas Gravante the attorney who represented Weisselberg in his plea said via email He was clear in signaling his judicial inclinations which helped me tremendously in giving Mr Weisselberg informed legal advice Judge Merchan was always wellprepared accessible and  most importantly in the Weisselberg matter  a man of his word He treated me and my colleagues with the utmost respect both in open court and behind closed doors Karen Friedman Agnifilo a private practice attorney who previously worked as the chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office supervising cases Merchan presided over echoed that sentiment Merchan doesnt let the prosecutors or the defendants create any issues in his courtroom He doesnt let a media circus or any other kind of circus happen I dont think Donald Trump attacking him and threatening him is going to bode very well for him in the courtroom Agnifilo said The judge is the kind of judge where he will ignore it and not hold it against Donald Trump Hes not vindictive in any way like that TOUGH BUT COMPASSIONATE Merchan showed some of his tough side when Weisselberg was sentenced telling the former Trump associate that if he had not already promised him a fivemonth sentence he would have handed him a much greater sentence after having listened to evidence at trial When he presided over Bannons criminal fraud case Merchan chastised the former Trump aides new team of attorneys for delaying the case when they asked for more time to review new evidence In addition to the Trump cases Merchan has also presided over other highprofile cases including the soccer mom madam trial in which he set a 2 million bond for suburban mom Anna Gristina who was charged with running a 2000anhour escort service for the wealthy Bloomberg News reported Merchan also handed a 25yearstolife sentence to a Senegalese man who raped and murdered his girlfriend Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview Friday on CNN that Merchan was not easy on him when he tried a case before him but echoed that the judge likely will be fair Ive tried a case in front of him before He could be tough I dont think its necessarily going to be something thats going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case Parlatore said Merchan however is also credited by his peers for having helped create the Manhattan Mental Health Court which he often presides over and where he has earned a reputation for compassionate rulings that give defendants second chances I watched a colleague of mine try a shooting case where someone got shot so hes able to try those very serious violent crimes and then switch said Brendan Tracy a criminal defense attorney who previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office Maybe someone who was a serial shoplifter and then charged with grand larceny and is in mental health treatment court because they had mental health issues he was able to handle the wide range of cases and do them all fairly Tracy added Still Earl Ward a trial attorney and chair of public defender nonprofit The Bronx Defenders said that having watched Merchan preside over cases in the Mental Health Court the judge often sided with prosecutors Hes fair and his rulings are consistent with the law but if its a close call his reputation is that he lands on the prosecutions side Ward said EARLY CAREER Merchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorneys Office Several years later he moved on to the state attorney generals office where he worked on cases in Long Island In 2006 New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg then a Republican appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx and Democratic Gov David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009 the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court Judge Born in Bogota Colombia Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of 6 and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights Queens according to a New York Times profile of the judge He was the first in his family to go to college Merchan initially studied business at Baruch College in New York before he dropped out of school to go work only to return several years later to finish school so that he could get his law degree the Times reported He eventually received his law degree from

credibility For generations Swahilis have maintained matrilineal family burial gardens such as this one in Faza town Lamu County Credit Chapurukha Kusimba 2012 CC BYND The legacy of the medieval Swahili civilization is a source of extraordinary pride in East Africa as reflected in its language being the official tongue of Kenya Tanzania and even inland countries like Uganda and Rwanda far from the Indian Ocean shore where the culture developed nearly two millennia ago Its ornate stone and coral towns hugged 2000 miles 3200 kilometers of the coast and its merchants played a linchpin role in the lucrative trade between Africa and lands across the ocean Arabia Persia India Southeast Asia and China By the turn of the second millennium Swahili people embraced Islam and some of their grand mosques still stand at the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Lamu in Kenya and Kilwa in Tanzania Selfgovernance ended following Portuguese colonization in the 1500s with control later shifting to the Omanis 17301964 Germans in Tanganyika 18841918 and British in Kenya and Uganda 18841963 Following independence coastal peoples were absorbed into the modern nationstates of Somalia Kenya Tanzania Mozambique and Madagascar So who were the Swahili people and where did their ancestors originally come from Ironically the story of Swahili origins has been molded almost entirely by nonSwahili people a challenge shared with many other marginalized and colonized peoples who are the modern descendants of cultures of the past with extraordinary achievements Working with a team of 42 colleagues including 17 African scholars and multiple members of the Swahili community weve now published the first ancient DNA sequences from peoples of the Swahili civilization Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological historical or political circles Instead they contradict and complicate all of them Colonization affected how the story was told Western archaeologists in the mid20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans Postcolonial scholars including one of us Kusimba pushed back against that view Earlier researchers had inflated the importance of nonAfrican influences by focusing on imported objects at Swahili sites They minimized the vast majority of locally made materials and what they revealed about African industry and innovation But viewing Swahili heritage as primarily African or nonAfrican is too simplistic In fact both perspectives are byproducts of colonialist biases The truth is that colonization of the East African coast did not end with the departure of the British in the middle of the 20th century Many colonial institutions were inherited and perpetuated by Africans As modern nationstates formed with governments controlled by inland peoples Swahili people continued to be undermined politically and economically in some cases as much as they had been under foreign rule Decades of archaeological research in consultation with local people aimed to address the marginalization of communities of Swahili descent Our team consulted oral traditions and used ethnoarchaeology and systematic surveys along with targeted excavations of residential industrial and cemetery locations Working with local scholars and elders we unearthed materials such as pottery metal and beads food house and industrial remains and imported objects such as porcelain glass glass beads and more Together they revealed the complexity of Swahili everyday life and the peoples cosmopolitan Indian Ocean heritage Ancient DNA analysis was always one of the most exciting prospects It offered the hope of using scientific methods to obtain answers to the question of how medieval people are related to earlier groups and to people today providing a counterweight to narratives imposed from outside Until a few years ago this kind of analysis was a dream But because of a technological revolution in 2010 the number of ancient humans with published genomescale data has risen from nothing to more than 10000 today Surprises in the ancient DNA We worked with local communities to determine the best practices for treating human remains in line with traditional Muslim religious sensitivities Cemetery excavations sampling and reburial of human remains were carried out in one season rather than dragging on indefinitely A detailed line drawing captures the way one persons remains were discovered during cemetery excavation at Mtwapa in 1996 Credit Eric Wert 2001 CC BYND Our team generated data from more than 80 people mostly elite individuals buried in the rich centers of the stone towns We will need to wait for future work to understand whether their genetic inheritance differed from people without their high status Contradicting what we had expected the ancestry of the people we analyzed was not largely African or Asian Instead these backgrounds were intertwined each contributing about half of the DNA of the people we analyzed We found that Asian ancestry in the medieval individuals came largely from Persia modernday Iran and that Asians and African ancestors began mixing at least 1000 years ago This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale Another surprise was that mixed in with the Persians Indians were a significant proportion of the earliest migrants Patterns in the DNA also suggest that after the transition to Omani control in the 18th century Asian immigrants became increasingly Arabian Later there was intermarriage with people whose DNA was similar to others in Africa As a result some modern people who identify as Swahili have inherited relatively little DNA from medieval peoples like those we analyzed while others have more One of the most revealing patterns our genetic analysis identified was that the overwhelming majority of maleline ancestors came from Asia while femaleline ancestors came from Africa This finding must reflect a history of Persian males traveling to the coast and having children with local women One of us Reich initially hypothesized that these patterns might reflect Asian men forcibly marrying African women because similar genetic signatures in other populations are known to reflect such violent histories But this theory does not account for what is known about the culture and there is a more likely explanation Traditional Swahili society is similar to many other East African Bantu cultures in being substantially matriarchalit places much economic and social power in the hands of women In traditional Swahili societies even today ownership of stone houses often passes down the female line And there is a long recorded history of female rulers beginning with Mwana Mkisi ruler of Mombasa as recorded by the Portuguese as early as the 1500s down to Sabani binti Ngumi ruler of Mikindani in Tanzania as late as 1886 Our best guess is that Persian men allied with and married into elite families and adopted local customs to enable them to be more successful traders The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coasts African matriarchal traditions confirms that this was not a simple history of African women being exploited African women retained critical aspects of their culture and passed it down for many generations How do these results gleaned from ancient DNA restore heritage for the Swahili Objective knowledge about the past has great potential to help marginalized peoples By making it possible to challenge and overturn narratives imposed from the outside for political or economic ends scientific research provides a meaningful and underappreciated tool for righting colonial wrongs This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license Read

towards batters was revealed in his book and then executed in some fashion against the Delhi Capitals batsmen,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing h 5228 chars,An excerpt from his book Mark Wood The Wood Life attempts to paint a picture  what does the pacer think while gazing into the eyes of his opponents Those very opponents who come prepared wearing helmets guards and pads to face him All you know is that you hate them Perhaps hates a strong word Or it isnt because all they want to do is make you look bad Theyll want to hit you for a boundary and if they do a slowmo of the shot will follow on the big screen to embarrass you even more A commentator will say you bowled too full too short or too wide and pick apart your technique Twitter will go into overdrive and say youre s or something and at the end of the day the captain will be asked in his press conference if you should be dropped for the next game writes Wood Compound this with 400 in four overs an envy inducing opening duo and a track that just offered 193 runs on it in the first innings with more dew settled on the surface And also the fact that his last IPL experience didnt go quite well Pulling a shutter down on all of it Wood steamed in to bowl that first delivery Trying to keep his strides short as he would mention later I feel at ease doing that charging in and letting it fly And just as he landed hard on that left foot with the impact shifting his toe right to the tip of his boot Wood let the ball fly Banged in short forcing a fivefeetsix Prithvi Shaw to hop and defend it down with all his might A hundredandforty something registered on the speed gun Quickest of the evening so far Itd get quicker The short ball has for long been the Achilles heel in Shaws short career So Wood delivered another Quick short but wide Now a little further up Softening him but keeping it quick And then he took it out of the proverbial hat A 1473kph fuller delivery angled in Pierced between the bat and pad to rattle the off stump About six months ago Wood had conceded he was almost done with Test cricket Good heavens he wasnt The 33yearold was in fact using the T20 stage to showcase his Test cricket arsenal A typical red ball setup to get that wicket One brings two here lads The most common of slip cordon phrases wouldve worked its way through his head There is no other reason that explains him catering to an almost identical pace and length off the next one Mitchell Marsh had been Australias top run scorer across the three ODIs and series in India He was used to such wickets and conditions having taken the attack to bowlers on these very surfaces On Saturday night however he stood posing for a straight drive as his off stump was cleaned up behind him Two wickets in two balls and Delhi sent in the closest they could to a Don Bradman For Sarfaraz Khan Wood packaged a Ctrl CV Shawstopping combo Short good length and full on the off Not a run was scored off the bat in that over This while the injury prone quick struggled with the dew I fall at even the best of times He had managed to bowl in a practice game under the same conditions during the evening at the same venue But at training you dont have the same intensity that you have during a match Intensity on which the Super Giants had to bank on for at least another over in a row David Warner had batted the most deliveries for Delhi so far Having been recently exiled from the Australian Test team there couldnt have been a better preAshes Test for the DC captain against one of Englands best Advertisement First up a 148 clicks banger that forced him to hop and fend deep in his crease Followed by a test of quick footwork to defend a good length ball on the off Then a 144 clicks short one which was negotiated for a single  the first off Wood Seeing as the new batter was on strike he decided to throw in a final surprise card and take the pace off In his threedelivery setup to Sarfaraz the England pacer catered only to the short length but turned down his speed from 140 to 137 kph A little more on the ball wouldve taken Sarfarazs uppercut over the long leg boundary Instead he was caught a couple of meters ahead Almost falling down while attempting the shot off a vicious incoming delivery Two overs Three runs Three wickets It wasnt quite game set match to Lucknow but Delhi never quite recovered from that Wood spell A spell meticulously worked on having

slightly sideways with the hat brim tilted to the right side which reveals one of two leaf ear clips by Cartier that she commissioned Around her neck is a necklace depicting two gold crocodiles by Cartier that she also commissioned The one crocodile is covered with 1023 brilliantcut fancy intense yellow diamonds and it sees the world through two navetteshaped emerald cabochons eyes The other is paved with 1060 emeralds and completed with two ruby cabochon eyes Entirely articulated the two crocodiles can be worn separately as brooches Both crocodiles are just under a foot in length The jewels

and Luis Buuels Fever rises in El Pao 1959 The Mexican diva and archetypal Latin femme fatale carried on her acting career until the late 1960s The crocodile necklace and another piece a large

highlighted with green red and black enamel It peers through eyes made of two pearshaped emeralds Pierre Rainero Cartier Image Style  Heritage director  JeanFrancois ROBERT Cartier Pierre Rainero whose career with Cartier spans 40 years with the last 20 as Image Style  Heritage director knew Flix when she lived in Paris She had an incredible sense of humor very witty and incredibly cultured Rainero said of her She could speak French fluently almost without an accent And she had a perfect knowledge of what society is She understood Parisian society perfectly She knew how to act and behave Her link with Cartier is from that period And its very interesting how she started to buy pieces from stock meaning already created by us panthers by the way Then she moved to special orders because she wanted panthers in her own style with different attitudes Then she commissioned special orders representing different animals and things You can see she understood that Cartier for her was a companion Platinum and diamond bangle Cartier Paris special order 1934 The client supplied almost all of   the stones Cartier You would be forgiven if you think the focus of the museum exhibition is on Flixs jewels based on the publicity surrounding the event or by reading this story up to now In actuality Flixs pieces though immensely impressive and expressive make up two of the 160 Cartier jewels watches and art objects in the exhibition They were culled from Cartiers inventory of more 3000 historic pieces dating from 1860 to the latter part of the 20th century Known as the Cartier Collection these objects of high design and craftsmanship have been shown at museum exhibitions around the world since 1989 Each exhibition has a different theme created by a guest curator who has access to the collection and the archives The Mexico City exhibition is the 39th such exhibition for the collection Among his responsibilities Rainero is in charge of the acquisition management archival information and the museum distribution of the Cartier Collection objects Ana Elena Mallet exhibition curator Cartier The exhibition is curated by Ana Elena Mallet a Mexico Citybased curator specializing in modern and contemporary design She had access to the jewels plus the archival information which as an art historian she was especially attracted to She created a retrospective of the history of Cartier design and style by dividing the exhibition into five sections The Early Days and the Birth of a Style Universal Curiosity Jeanne Toussaints Taste Wearing Beauty and Measuring Time and Mara Flix and Icons of Elegance Design for a tiara Cartier Paris circa 1906 Proposal for an execution in platinum and diamonds   Graphite and gouache on tracing paper Cartier I really wanted it to be a narrative that you could understand from the first stylesthat garland styleand how it evolved into Art Deco and then the 20s she said Then looking at other cultures and then learn how it changes in the 30s with more volume and different stones when Jeanne Toussaint comes into the picture It really helps to understand how this style developed People at the end could understand why Mara Flix would choose Cartier as her house of preference because they were daring and they were innovating in with different materials aesthetics and techniques At that time going to Cartier was like going to the doctor she added They would tell you what to wear and how to look Maria understood that Cartier could do that How Cartier can translate her style and her will Oiseau Libere brooch gold platinum rosecut diamonds one sapphire cabochon eye coral lapis   lazuli During World War II Cartier designed various pieces featuring caged birds symbolizing occupied France Once Paris was liberated jewels were designed with the patrioticallycolored bird bursting from its cage in an explosion of joy Cartier Mallet was especially excited to curate this exhibition because Cartier previously held an exhibition of its jewels in Mexico City in 1999 and she attended it in the beginning of her professional art career She left the exhibition impressed that jewels can be used in a museum context For me it was really important to understand that this material could also belong in a museum and multiple cultural lectures could be done with this amazing material that is jewelry she said Because of this it was very exciting for me to have the opportunity to work with the Cartier Collection Mallet had several challenges when it came to creating her vision for the exhibition The main one was to tie the exhibition to Mexico and Latin America which was no easy feat since the Cartier archives provided little in this area of expertise and inspiration Why have a Cartier exhibition in Mexico right now There should be Mexican links Mallet said I know Louis Cartier was looking to the orient and to China and India But what about Mexico and South America There was a jewel in the collection that looked like it could be of preColumbian inspiration an unusual platinum pyramid clip brooch commissioned in 1935 with baguette diamonds coming out of its sides and a round oldcut diamond of more than four carats in the center It appears to have been inspired by a Mayan or similar temple but there was no information to prove it It became the first piece in the exhibition Pyramid clip brooch Cartier Paris special order 1935 Platinum round oldcut diamonds one   weighing approximately 420 carats baguette and singlecut diamonds Two identical clip brooches were originally made to be worn separately or as a single piece the client later asked that one of the brooches be set on a bracelet of white gold and black lacquer Cartier We didnt find any proof in the archive but the pyramid was there The first piece in the exhibition That was a South America or Latin America pyramid This is proof they were looking here And of course the end of the show with Maria Felix theres a connection I thought we could tie the Mexican connection in the beginning and the end It is obviously very similar to Mayan pyramid added Rainero But our archives do not have the evidence that there was an image of a pyramid that led to this piece In many other cases we have the inspiration This design is so obvious it says a lot about the imagery of preColumbian architecture that was present in the minds of our people Design for a bracelet Cartier Paris 1934 Executed in platinum and diamonds Graphite and gouache   on tracing paper Cartier Another association with Latin America is the Santos watch It is believed to be the first wristwatch Louis Cartier created this watch in 1904 for Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto SantosDumont who complained that he had difficulty flying while using his pocket watch It was a simple solution to a serious problem that may have made the wristwatch fashionable The fourth section of the exhibition relating to Cartier timepieces includes an area dedicated to the aviator and the Santos watch For Mallet her favorite part of the exhibition was the third section dedicated to Jeanne Toussaint 18871976 one of the most important artistic and design influences of Cartier Louis Cartier named her the director of artistic design in 1933 an unheardof post for a woman at that time She was best known for panther jewels an iconic symbol of the jewelry house During her career she moved from Art Deco jewels to sculptural and threedimensional panther creations typically set with white and yellow diamonds emeralds and onyx Her first panther jewela gold and enamel panther brooch set with a cabochon emeraldwas crafted for the Duchess of Windsor Wallace Simpson in 1948 Her influence at Cartier lasted until she retired in 1970 For me it was really important because I didnt know anything about Jeanne Toussaint Mallet said Cartier having a creative director as early as 1933 And that she was a freespirited woman super independent with a mind of her own in in the 1930s was fantastic How Jeanne Toussaint started looking at the world and trying to bring Cartier into fashion and fashion into Cartier She was very good friends with Coco Chanel and with fashion editors at the time Mara Flixs Snake necklace Cartier Paris special order 1968 Cartier It was also unusual for any single person much less a women in the early 20th century to have such an influence over the artistic style at Cartier In 2017 Cyrille Vigneron Cartiers CEO explained to me that while Cartier has some styles that have become iconic such as Tutti Frutti jewels the Panther and floral patterns the luxury brand creates high jewels of all shapes styles and creativity because each piece is developed around the gems they purchase Basically each work starts with a stone and goes through all sorts of inspirations and openness to the world he said The results of this process are jewels of varying shapes styles and motifs that are still identifiable as Cartier based on the quality of the artistry and craftsmanship Whether its figurative or nonfigurative whether its geometric or some kind of art style or when its just a source of inspiration that is absolutely new he said All of them are Cartier in their way Inside the exhibition space created by architect Frida Escobedo Cartier Space plays an equally important role in the exhibition Mexican architect Frida Escobedo created a darkened environment with recessed vitrines brightened with spotlights allowing the bejeweled objects to standout in the darkness Its not the first such exhibition to use darkened space to focus on the jewels Wallace Chan used this technique in his Hong Kong exhibition and JARs 2013 exhibition space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was so dark that people were bumping into one another But this space at Meso Jumex is different in that it combines a spiritual experience and sense of discovery Not only discovering the jewels but its as if you are in a cave discovering the materials as well Im interested in this idea of a ruin but not the ruin in the sense of decay More like something that is in perpetual construction or in the process of being made Escobedo said I think quarries and some archaeological sites share that relationship Mexican architect Frida Escobedo Cartier To me the idea was of going deeper into the layers of history of the legacy of Cartier The idea of going underground to the origin And then you take these paths that takes you chronologically through all the pieces You can see the references and how they influence each other throughout the history of the house Theres also a frame of reference for each vitrine For example the first piece the pyramid brooch that looks like a Mayan temple is the first piece one encounters at the end of a long and darkened corridor Escobedo says she tried to create this effect throughout the exhibition It was important for us to plan together with Ana Mallet from the logical order of the pieces but also to always have a point of attention and tension so you can see a piece at the end of a corridor or something that was framed that would pull you into the next section Its almost like a teaser to the next section of the exhibition Museo Jumex Cartier The design is based on photos of the ancient Tenayuca pyramid just outside Mexico City taken in the 1930s by artist Josef Albers The walls of the space were made of darkened concrete panels quite large poured individually with textured vertical lines They are mounted on an angle Its a monumental work But also whats nice about it is that you can see the craftsmanship Escobedo said of the exhibition space You can see the nuances of each of the panels At the same time it is very subtle as a background Its rich but its not overpowering the pieces Its just creating a backdrop for them Cartiers pieces in the exhibition combines exceptional materials fine craftsmanship and historical importance However Mallet made a deliberate decision to include only the basic details of each piece in the exhibition Rainero agrees with this decision so those in the exhibition can focus on the forms of the pieces and how the changing style of Cartier through the years relates to how the luxury brand has evolved I think theres a consistency a coherence in the exhibition which is selfexplanatory he said And I think this exhibition is very interesting because like art in general but in many museums the curators want to give as much information about the artist or whatever And sometimes its at the price of the appreciation of each of the works This exhibition for me combines the two because of the way the windows are separated one from the other the number of pieces in each window and the type of lighting It allows the visitor to appreciate the beauty of each of the piece at the same time You understand the message and the thinking of the curator So I think theres a very good balance for the visitor when going through the exhibition,entertainment,Cartier is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year and to mark the occasion it has released a series of photographs of some of its most famous customers.

happily married to Sumit as viewers wonder if hell ever relocate to the USA 90 Day Fianc couple Jenny and Sumit knew each other for almost a decade when they got married in August 2021 Their wedding was the couples secret until Sumit could announce it to his parents They were last seen together in 90 Day Fianc Happily Ever After season 7 which documented how their age difference affected their compatibility as husband and wife However Jenny whos still in India is making things work with Sumit as fans watch Jenny and Sumit on new Pillow Talk episodes SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT 5 90 Day Fianc Couple Jenny  Sumits Age Gap Jenny and Sumit are celebrated as one of the franchises most real couples As a pair they also represent a common storyline that has been seen in the franchise to date The shows initial concept was to document brides coming from Eastern European countries such as Russia to the US It also started to focus on large age gaps between couples including shocking age differences between white women who had met foreign men online and wanted to get married to them The biggest 90 Day Fianc age gap until then between an American woman and her boyfriend might have been between Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi Michael and Angelas age differs by 22 years Before them it was Darcey Silva and Jesse Meester with an 18year age gap However Jenny is a whopping 29 years older than Sumit At present Jenny is 63 years old while Sumit is 34 years old The couple seems to have met a decade ago in 2012 This means when Jenny and Sumit met they were 53 and 24 years old respectively which by all means is a concerning age difference 4 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Catfished Jenny Of course Jenny might have not known Sumits real age when she first met him In fact Jenny didnt even know Sumit He was pretending to be a man called Michael Jones Sumit seemed to have made a fake profile with the name he used at his call center job in Delhi He used it for playing games on Facebook Sumit had pictures of S Club 7 singer Rachels husband Alex Bourne as his display profile When Jenny suspected that Sumits photos came from a magazine he even claimed that a colleague had clicked them Apart from Alex Sumit also used Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoors photos 3 90 Day Fianc Star Sumit Was Already Married To Another Woman Its strange and funny how Jenny didnt realize he was pretending to be two different men posting pictures of two completely different celebrities Regardless Sumit continued to hide one more secret from Jenny even after he finally came clean to her and she found him cute Jenny had visited Sumits house in 2012 under the guise of being his friend Jenny even stayed with Sumits family for two months Apart from overstaying her welcome Jenny also welcomed Sumit into her room in the middle of the night She took Sumits virginity Sumit was caught redhanded by his father It seems once Jenny went back to America Sumit was married off to another woman Sumit stayed married to the woman for several years while he continued to date Jenny longdistance But once Sumit started to film 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 1 and started staying with Jenny in a different home than his parents and wife the wife became suspicious She had gone to Jennys door leaving the Palm Springs woman shellshocked while Sumits wife also got the police involved in the altercation that followed 2 90 Day Fianc Star Jenny Tried To Become Hare Krishna Devotee Once Sumit and his exwife divorced the coast became clear for Jenny to get married to him At least thats what Jenny thought because Sumits parents Sadhna and Anil never accepted her as Sumits wife With Sumit waiting for his parents to grant him permission to get married Jenny moved to India again While she waited for Sumit to agree Jennys tourist visa expired and the pandemic struck adding more restrictions on her flying in and out of the country In order to keep staying in India a lawyer suggested Jenny should consider giving up her American citizenship and the benefits that came with it The attorney suggested Jenny had only one technical option left He asked Jenny to apply for a missionary visa through ISKCON which stands for International Society for Krishna Consciousness Jenny laughed at the idea of becoming a Hare Krishna devotee considering shes not a religious person She was filmed visiting the temple and talking to the religious heads to know how she could continue staying in India But the missionary visa wasnt as much of a loophole as it was an obstacle in Jenny and Sumits relationship The last option was for Sumit to get over his cold feet and marry Jenny which he did although in secret 1 90 Day Fianc Star Sumits Mom Does Neti Yoga One of the most disturbing scenes in Sumit and Jennys 90 Day Fianc storyline involved Sumits mother Sadhna doing neti Sumits mother and father were visiting Jenny and his home during 90 Day Fianc The Other Way season 3 They wanted to check how much of a daughterinlaw Jenny could be to them considering she was much older than Sumits mother herself Upon entering the house Sumits mother inspected the kitchen and squealed with disgust upon noticing how Sumit and Jenny were staying in unhygienic conditions But then Sadhna did something even more strange during her yoga practice Jenny whos lost weight recently is generally a fit woman for someone whos in her mid60s Yet Sumits parents wanted to test Jennys strength and flexibility They tried to get Jenny to perform various asanas and also neti yoga which involved them cleaning their noses with a thread After pouring mustard oil down their nostrils Sumits mom and dad had inserted a thick piece of thread through their noses and gagged until it emerged out of their throats so they could floss their nasal passages with it The 90 Day Fianc scene was unwatchable because nasal flossing had nothing to do with Jennys daughterinlaw skills Source Sumit SinghInstagram,entertainment,90 Day Fianc stars Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh have been part of many eyebrowraising scandals in the franchise since debuting on 90 Day Fianc The Other Way Palm Springs resident Jenny was a mom to three grownup daughters with grandchildren when she flew to India to get married Sumit in Delhi

Peleg This compilation of 30 essays and conversations considers the practices of women filmmakers working from the 1970s to 90s encompassing a huge swath of creativity and diversity that is acknowledged from the start Edited by Erika Balsom and Hila Peleg the anthology tackles the politics of filmmaking in Chile India Angola Colombia and more extracting lessons we can take away from women filmmakers across the world and presenting a critical perspective of what feminist cinema has to offer In presenting a vast heterogeneity the book leaves an open question as to what affirmatively brings these works together An easy distinction could be made between two rough groupings of filmmakers those from Europe and the US navigating feminist movements and a sexist arts world and those in Africa Asia and Latin America with a Third Cinema lineage and an anticolonial lens notes reviewer Sanoja Bhaumik This division is certainly too simplistic  complicated by diasporic origins Western education class and racial identities and the actual substance of films  but it does motivate a more comprehensive framework for how women filmmakers relate to the West to imperialism

musical the challenges of recreating the eponymous Mithun Chakrabortystarrer 1982 blockbuster film for the stage and about launching a devotionalmusic channel that will feature all faiths Edited excerpts SalimSulaimans Disco Dancer stage musical in London Your new musical will be premiering in Mumbai this month but musicals arent a new zone for you We launched the musical Disco Dancer last year in London it did really well there and we are doing it in Mumbai from April 10 onwards at the NSCI Dome in Worli Our first musical was Beyond Bollywood which was 10 years ago It did exceptionally well in London Europe the UAE and at the Kingdom of Dreams Gurugram We then did Umrao Jaan in 2019 And again we did a very successful run of it in London in January 2020 Following this COVID stalled everything and we will be relaunching the Umrao Jaan musical very soon Thats our next project The 1980s movie Disco Dancer was a superhit why did you choose this for a musical how are you going about presenting it on stage Mithun das Mithun Chakraborty Disco Dancer was the most epic film In those days in the 80s it was one of the first few films to have crossed Rs 100 crore earnings back then We love the film and whenever we see it we are transported to that era I have seen it three times as a child I was a kid when it released and can never forget it because I used to watch Mithin das steps and was so much in awe of that music And Bappi das late Bappi Lahiris compositions were super hits I Am A Disco Dancer written by Anjaan sung by Vijay Benedict Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Parvati Khan Koi Yahan Nache Nache by Faruk Kaiser and sung by Bappi da and Usha Uthup Ae Oh Aa Zara Mudke written by Anjaan and sung by Kishore Kumar Yaad Aa Raha Hai Anjaans words and Bappi das voice Krishna Dharti Pe Aaja Anjaans lyrics and sung by Nandu Bhende Goron Ki Na Kalon Ki two versions written by Anjaan and sung by Suresh Wadkar and Usha Mangeshkar So many hits in one single film single album It was a rare project when all songs did so well nationally  combined with Bappi das iconic music Mithun das dance and acting and Babbar Subhashs direction We wanted to bring that alive as a musical on stage To recreate a classic isnt easy especially so if you are using a different platform  a film to a stage musical How much of this was a challenge It is a huge challenge of course because obviously the film had a lot of layers about the mother the struggle of a poor boy growing up to become a mega star and then after his mothers demise he takes revenge there is a lot of subtext for this musical There are many good messages of belief determination love for your parents love for your art and of course there is a romantic love story in it also It was a huge challenge to recreate historic legendary songs of Bappi da and then bring it on to the stage We also had to compose two fresh original songs especially for this musical And since it is set in the 80s we relived the entire era with costumes dancing and dialogues It was quite the challenge Disco Dancer musical in London Tell us about the cast Are all the actors also singers Yes Arjun Talwar plays the role of Jimmy Tia Kar is the female lead She was an Indian Idol contestant from 2012 whom I have known closely because I was a judge for that season All the singing is live and music is partly recorded and partly live Of course there is amazing choreography directed by Rajiv Goswami He has done incredible work He directed Umrao Jaan Beyond Bollywood and this is his third with us Irfan Siddiqui is the lyricist and has written for a lot of the movies Im composing for including Fashion 2008 Iqbal 2005 Kurbaan 2009 He has also written the new song that we have composed for this particular show and also the dialogues Saregama India Ltd is producing it and Suniel Shetty who is a huge fan of Bappi da and Mithun da is presenting it Bappi da passed away last year Did he know about this musical What was the first reaction to this When I last spoke to Bappi da in 2019 about our intention of redoing the iconic film as a musical for the stage he was extremely happy It was my dream that Bappi da could come for the premier He gave us his blessings all throughout the making of the musical Its really unfortunate that we lost him last year Arjun Talwar as Jimmy in Disco Dancer stage musical in London You recently launched a devotional channel Tell us about that My label is doing very well so I am extremely happy with that We are releasing many new songs focussing on festivals and recently we started a new devotional channel with the beginning of Ramzan On this we will be releasing devotional music from various faiths right from bhajans Sufi qawwalis aarti stutis shlokas mantras We

representen una imagen de una morada secreta protegida de la vista nada podra estar ms lejos de la verdad Porque esta es una casa que no trata de mimetizarse quiere sobresalir del resto llamar la atencin y captar esas miradas de la calle declaran los arquitectos Aslam Karadan y Sham Salim del estudio homnimo AslamSham Architects con sede en Kozhikode Es absolutamente nico con su forma y tiene la intencin de capturar la intriga de los transentes tal como el cliente quera La parte oculta del apodo explican proviene de la escala disfrazada de la casa una casa de tres niveles que crea la ilusin de ser una estructura ms pequea de dos pisos Clientes  Ajmal y Sabna una pareja joven de unos 30 aos Ajmal es un emprendedor que se hizo a s mismo y es cofundador de Eduwizz una startup de tecnologa educativa repartida por todo Kerala Sabna tambin es parte de la misma compaa Aunque los principales clientes son Ajmal Sabna y sus dos nias los padres de Ajmal y sus dos hermanos menores tambin son ocupantes de la casa El resumen funcional era bastante estndar y sencillo es decir queran una casa de 5 BHK con una habitacin adicional para usar como cine en casa piscina y otras comodidades estndar Sin embargo el resumen esttico es algo que a nosotros como arquitectos nos encant y encontramos desafiante al mismo tiempo El cliente como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario exitoso hecho a s mismo y quera construir una casa que hiciera una declaracin desde el primer vistazo pero que al mismo tiempo no comprometiera demasiado las funcionalidades Nos dieron la tarea de idear algo que estuviera fuera de la caja pero que no fuera completamente experimental Este resumen combinado con la naturaleza altamente contorneada del sitio que se inclinaba hacia abajo abruptamente desde el frente del sitio hacia la parte trasera es lo que condujo a la formafachada bastante nica del edificio y su nombre la Casa Oculta La escala de la casa permanece en gran medida oculta para un espectador desde la calle pero al mismo tiempo se destaca con su forma atpica y crea esa curiosidad en sus mentes por saber qu hay detrs de esa formafachada frontal peculiar En cuanto a la configuracin espacial la zonificacin bsica se ha realizado en funcin de la proximidad con la va que bordea el frente del solar La primera zona es la zona pblica que tiene visibilidad desde la calle y alberga el asiento delantero as como el espacio de vida formal que est destinado principalmente a los visitantesinvitados Luego viene la siguiente zona que es la zona semipblica que es el centro de actividad central y lo que nos gustara llamar como el alma de la casa que tiene el estanque Koi iluminado alrededor del cual se planifican todos los espacios de actividad central de la casa a saber la sala de estar familiar el comedor y la cocina Y luego viene la zona privada que alberga las habitaciones el cine en casa y la piscina que se coloca en la parte trasera del sitio y por lo tanto est completamente aislada de los extraos Adems con respecto a la configuracin espacial debe comprender que esto no se hace en un sitio plano este es un sitio muy contorneado por lo que tambin podramos lograr esta diferenciacin de zonificacin con los niveles Sin embargo desde el dormitorio principal se abre un balcn hacia el frente de la casa que era un requisito del cliente que necesitaba ver desde la entrada principal al sitio desde el dormitorio principal La parcela en forma de L tiene una parte que sobresale hacia el exterior en la parte trasera esta parte es la que se utiliza para acomodar el garaje El camino de entrada y las reas del garaje cuentan con paisajismo mientras que se proporciona ms paisajismo verde en el patio delantero La parte ms desafiante as como la ms emocionante de este proyecto fue definitivamente el proceso de manipular este sitio altamente contorneado para tener una casa con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intentaba reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da normal Esto se ha logrado dividiendo diferentes zonas en mltiples niveles La entrada principal a la casa est en la zona pblica que est a un nivel de solo un par de pasos desde el nivel del suelo que se aproxima en el frente el que est entre las paredes de granito macizo en el frente que juega con el sentido de escala a un visitante Este nivel tiene la sala de estar formal as como la sala de oracin nombres las cuales estn destinadas principalmente a los visitantes La entrada secundaria la entrada lateral en arco es la ms destinada a la familia ya que accede al ncleo de actividad principal de la casa con un solo paso Solo necesita bajar un paso desde ese nivel para llegar a la zona semipblica que alberga el estanque Koi el espacio de vida familiar el comedor y la cocina Es desde este nivel que se accede a los bloques de dormitorios mltiples que se distribuyen en tres niveles Entonces desde el nivel del rea comn es solo medio piso de ascenso y descenso a los 2 niveles que tienen 2 dormitorios cada uno El dormitorio principal y el cine en casa se encuentran en el nivel ms alto con un espacio de estudio y una terraza de servicio en un nivel medio entre estos dos niveles Por lo tanto la casa en total se divide en 67 niveles para adaptarse a todos los requisitos espaciales de los clientes sin alterar demasiado los niveles del sitio existente Tambin hay acceso terciario a la casa desde el nivel ms bajo que es el mismo que el nivel de la piscina el camino de acceso de la se extiende hacia la parte trasera del sitio y hay un porche desde el que se puede acceder a la casa y hay dos dormitorios tambin a este nivel Se puede acceder a este nivel a travs de una rampa y los 2 dormitorios aqu con acceso para automviles aseguran que la casa sea fcilmente accesible para las personas mayores y las personas con capacidades diferentes El ascensor se ha construido en la casa y por lo tanto siempre existe la posibilidad de agregar un ascensor ms adelante para acceder a todos los niveles cmodamente La paleta de materiales y colores se ha decidido principalmente para dar a la casa un carcter muy simple pero sofisticado Aparte de los blancos las texturas naturales de la mampostera de escombros al azar la madera los pisos de piedra natural con acabado de mltiples texturas como el granito las piedras de Kota la madera de la plataforma etc se eligieron para dar carcter a cada espacio y diferenciarlos visualmente sin comprometer la sensacin abierta de el espacio Los acentos verdes en toda la casa con macetas tambin ayudan a crear una sensacin clida y acogedora para el usuario Nos gusta exponer el verdadero carcter de los materiales en lugar de imitarlos en otra cosa y por lo tanto las losas de techo de hormign y los muros de contencin tienen texturas de hormign sin embargo es un acabado de hormign ms pulido para los interiores mientras que es un tono ms spero para el exterior La estrategia de iluminacin es algo fundamental para todos nuestros diseos diseamos para la mxima iluminacin natural durante todo el da lo que creemos que crea un bienestar mental para el usuario de manera subconsciente Idealmente queremos que las luces artificiales se usen solo una vez que se pone el sol Las duras luces del este y el oeste estn bloqueadas para que no caigan directamente en la casa y se toman de manera difusa a travs de pantallas con persianas fuera de las ventanas Por la noche se proporciona una iluminacin ambiental sutil en los interiores que brindan una comodidad ptima al usuario Sin embargo a los exteriores se les da una iluminacin un poco ms dramtica para que la estructura se destaque para un espectador desde la calle que era algo que el cliente deseaba Para ser honesto no podramos haber encontrado un cliente ms complaciente que estos dos ya que quedaron completamente cautivados por el concepto se los presentamos y apenas les pedimos cambios salvo los ajustes menores en el interior Este proyecto es uno de los ejemplos perfectos de cunto se puede elevar el producto final cuando los arquitectos y los clientes estn sincronizados Entonces fue ms como un sueo que todos vimos juntos Sera extremadamente difcil elegir un lugar como el favorito pero si tuviramos que elegir uno sera el ncleo de actividad principal de la casa que alberga todos los espacios comunes alrededor del estanque Koi iluminado por el cielo La terraza al aire libre desde el comedor que da al rea de la piscina es otro de los favoritos El cliente que como se mencion anteriormente es un empresario y pasa la mayor parte del tiempo en su propia casa ya que su trabajo se realiza en lnea nos dice que le encanta pasar tiempo en esta casa y que sigue encontrando nuevos lugares y siente cada espacio con cada pasar el da en la medida en que odia cuando tiene que irse para reuniones relacionadas con el trabajo de vez en cuando La mayora de los muebles se personalizan segn el espacio y el tema de diseo de la casa salvo algunos muebles sueltos y otros con mltiples niveles al mismo tiempo que intenta reducir la cantidad de escaladas que el usuario tendra que atravesar en un da

author of On Nixons Madness An Emotional History March 2023 Richard Nixon discusses Vietnam with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and Deputy National Security Advisor Al Haig at Camp David 1972 When H R Bob Haldeman first described Richard Nixons madman theory in his 1978 memoir The Ends of Power few scholars paid serious attention For those who did notice the oneparagraph description of Nixons riskladen strategy sounded like Haldeman was taking a cheap shot calling his old boss crazy After all Nixon had seen his chief of staff resign and serve time for the Watergate coverup The madman theory Haldeman wrote was a phrasewhich Im sure will bring smiles of delight to Nixonhaters everywhere Nearly half a century later scholars have established that the rash ruse was central to Nixons strategy to fight the Cold War The madman theory can also tell us a good deal about the famously elusive expresident himself how Nixon saw his career as he saw the superpower struggle how life for Nixon proved to be laden with exhilarating risk peril and a series of tests of will against determined foes According to Haldeman Nixon promised that he could end the Vietnam War by intimidating the North Vietnamese with seemingly reckless abandon I want the North Vietnamese to believe Ive reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war Nixon reportedly told his top aide He would play a kind of latterday ogre in the presidents words obsessed angry not able to be restrained As his national security advisor Henry Kissinger remarked Nixons strategy resembled a poker game in which he pushed so many chips into the pot that the United States foes would think the president had gone crazy Nixon liked to concoct names for such gambits He called this one the madman theory Yet the ploy pivoted on the idea that he did not consider himself to be mad He considered himself crafty It was not that he was suicidal but that he would act as if he were willing to risk joint nuclear annihilation The trick of the madman theory was how difficult it was for observers to decipher whether he would act on his threats for allout war or if he were simply pretending The more elusive the distinction the more effective the bluff The better the actor the crazier he seemed and if not firstrate Nixon was a perpetual performer Throughout his career he transformed from Redbaiter to Average Joe to worldly diplomat to crafty pol to elder statesman Haldeman called Nixon the Man of Many Facets The part of the bullying ogre was another role to play In the fall of 1969 Nixon enacted the madman theory threatening the North Vietnamese with abandon B52s loaded with nuclear weapons circling the Arctic aircraft carriers deployed to the Pacific a feint that pantomimed laying mines at the major North Vietnamese port of Haiphong Nixon believed he could scare Hanoi into peace he couldnt and he didnt The communists refused to back down and the war ground on and on Nixons faith in the madman theory did not however abate The historians William Burr and Jeffrey P Kimball the most notable scholars of the madman theory have written of how Nixon continued to adopt the strategy threatening nuclear intervention during a civil war in Jordan a crisis between Israel and its Arab neighbors and a bloody struggle between India and Pakistan Although it didnt fool the North Vietnamese the madman theory did work to a degree in Moscow As the Soviet Foreign Minister worried Nixon put forces on alert so often that it is hard to know what it meant Rather than a steady march toward dtente Nixon approached the Cold War as a series of emergencies demanding offthecuff often rash decisionmaking He looked at the superpower standoff and its proxy wars as a set of conflicts lurching from one crisis to the next from Latin America to Europe from the Middle East to South Asia to the Pacific Whether elated or aggravated Nixon returned spiritedly to the coercive ruse of the madman theory which reflected not only his predilection for acting and for secrecy but also his penchant for taking great gambles in pursuit of evergreater gains Nixon likewise envisioned himself as ever in the spotlight He saw his life as ever a fight to fend off fierce rivals as ever on the verge of great victory or collapse as ever a series of tests demanding great political gambles and allout assaults The madman theory tested his striving and determination and his skills as a performer It was another version of the story he told of himself of the lonely bootstrapped Dick Nixon risking everything as he reeled from crisis to crisis struggling gambling breakneck against a dangerous and threatening world And With no political experience not even owning a suit with only 10000 in the bank his wife Pat pregnant Nixon had taken a longshot chance at running for Congress in 1946 Four years later he ran for Senate with terrible odds against the muchbeloved Democrat incumbent and onetime move star Helen GahaganDouglas He continued to risk take risks in his political career in order to climb quickly precociously running for the vice presidency under Dwight Eisenhower at age 39 Two years after his defeat to John Kennedy for the 1960 presidency a 49yearold Nixon described his life not only as a set of gambles but as a pattern of excruciating public tests against powerful enemies looking to destroy him He titled his first biography Six Crises to describe his professional ascent He wrote of standing up valiantly to communists in the State Department during the House UnAmerican Activities Committee hearings He wrote of how he had been publicly castigated by Democrats for keeping a secret campaign fund that he maintained only defrayed costs for constituent mail and secretaries He recounted how his limousine had been attacked by leftist rioters on a diplomatic trip to Caracas Venezuela He described his showdown with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on an American kitchen display in the heart of Moscow Nixon wrote consistently of exhilaration and fright in the face of these public standoffs It was a circular telling He was ever acting the actor taking on the role of the performer prosecutor debater ambassador As he railed I have contempt for men who wont take chances I call them gutless wonders He maligned the press the counterculture antiwar protestors the naysayers those on the sidelines who played it safe They were not doers they were the feeble critics sickly Action and risk for Nixon were to be cherished As for the man in the arena willing to take chances he quoted Theodore Roosevelt If he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat The fundamental aspect of the madman theory Nixon told Haldeman was that he alone could play the part The communists Nixon insisted would believe any threat of force that Nixon makes because its Nixon Indeed the madman theory seemed a caricature of the famously frustrated politician It was he who baited the Reds furiously It was he who would not be kicked around anymore He who would not be contained He who could transform from new Nixon to new Nixon He insisted to Haldeman that the foremost reason that the madman strategy would work was his mad guise It was his reputation and his ability to act The strategic theory the crazed bluffery like a glove fit the man temper and control risk and performance The nuclear ruse would work Nixon proposed because its Nixon,entertainment,As the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War approaches it is worth taking a moment to consider the madman theory.
