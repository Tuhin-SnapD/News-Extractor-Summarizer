Police say the men also stole Sharma's cell phones and gold rings before fleeing the scene. The men were arrested two days later. Police say they found a gun and five cartridges in the men's car, the Times of India reports. Police say one of the men is a history-sheeter with at least five criminal cases against him.

– England's Mark Wood took five for 15 as the Delhi Super Giants beat the Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in an Indian Premier League match Saturday in New Delhi, the Guardian reports. It was the first game of the tournament for both teams, and it was a good sign for the 33-year-old pacer, who's been in and out of the England team for the past few years due to injuries. "It's great to be back on the field and playing for Delhi Super Giants," he said after the game. "It's been a long time since I've been out of the England team and it's great to be back on the field and playing for Delhi Super Giants." The Guardian has an excerpt from Wood's new book, The Wood Life, in which he talks about how he almost quit the sport after suffering a series of injuries, including a stress fracture in his back. But he says he's been working on his craft under the watchful eye of former England spinner Graeme Swann, who's now the team's bowling coach. "Just try to bowl similar to what I do for England Wood shared with the player of the match trophy in his hand for a first five- wicket haul in IPL 2023,"
– The Wall Street Journal is out with an interesting stat about gas prices: The average price of a gallon of gas in Japan is now pegged at 70 yen, which is about half the cost of a gallon of gas in the US. That's a big change from earlier this year, when the average in Japan was pegged at 69 yen. The Journal explains that the decision to cap gas prices at 70 yen was made by Japan's government, not the country's people. It's not the first time Japan has done so: The country had set a cap of 70 yen for gas in 2008, but it dropped to 65 yen the following year.
– A new report from an international supply chain watchdog warns that efforts to combat modern slavery are "stalling," the Guardian reports. According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, just 29% of companies with a turnover of more than $35 million in the UK have complied with a 2015 law requiring them to publish an annual statement on anti-slavery measures within their supply chains. The CIPS says the government should be more forceful in enforcing the law, which is set to be passed this year. "It is an open secret that vulnerable adults and children are exploited every day to produce the goods and services we consume," the CIPS' chief operating officer tells the Independent. "It is precisely during times of economic hardship that we must be vigilant and keep up our efforts to tackle this issue." The CIPS found that just 8,074 statements were submitted to the UK's Modern Slavery Registry last year, a 46% drop from the previous year. The government is expected to introduce a new modern slavery bill to parliament this year that would make submissions to the registry mandatory for qualifying businesses. The CIPS says the government has not appointed a person to fill the post of independent anti-slavery commissioner since April 2017.
